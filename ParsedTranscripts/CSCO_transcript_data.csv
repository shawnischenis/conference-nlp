CSCO,Q4 2016,2559,2822,1652,"Thanks, Sam. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's fourth-quarter FY16 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations; and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of FY17. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call, for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices business, and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 FY16. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, product orders and backlog information we will be discussing, is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn. We executed extremely well in Q4, with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS, which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter, wrapping up a great year. We closed out our fiscal year with $48.7 billion in revenue, up 3%, and non-GAAP EPS, which grew 8% to a record $2.36. Gross margins and operating margins were consistently strong throughout the year. We continue to manage our business well, and these results underscore our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and our rigorous discipline on profitability. Over this past fiscal year, we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility. Our fourth quarter was no exception. After three consecutive quarters of growth, both Service Provider and Emerging Markets turned negative. Service Provider orders declined 5%, reflecting the many challenges in that customer segment that you've heard from our peers. In addition, Emerging Markets orders were down 6%. The remainder of the business remained healthy, with orders growing 5%. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are well-positioned to capture the benefits of any tailwinds. At the same time, we're aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term, regardless of the environment. We had strong performance in Security, Data Center, Switching, Collaboration and Services, as well as continued success in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions. We remained focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we've made great progress over the past year in these priority areas, where we continue to see momentum. First, security. Security is the number-one priority for every customer. As the global leader in networking, Cisco is uniquely positioned to deliver security at scale with leading-edge innovation, as we lead the transition to cloud-delivered security. Our team has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on this distinct advantage that Cisco has in the most critical area for our customers. For example, we've been rapidly shifting our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. This past quarter, we delivered our third-consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with revenue up 16% and deferred revenue growing 29% as a result of this shift. We continue to add significant features and functionality to our security portfolio, both through internal innovation and M&A, to meet our customers' most pressing needs. Such as cloud Defense Orchestrator, which provides cloud-based security policy management. Stealthwatch Learning Networks, which leverages a network infrastructure, analytics and distributed machine learning to provide visibility and security intelligence across the enterprise. We have also extended our cloud-based security platform through our acquisition of CloudLock, an as-a-service offering enabling the ability to secure cloud applications. Over the past year, we've demonstrated tremendous success in rapidly deploying Cisco's advanced threat solutions to our global customer base with our AMP solution, now deployed at over 17,000 customers around the world. As we have done in the advanced threat market, we are now deeply focused on winning in the next-generation firewall market. We launched our full-featured next-generation firewall in March, and we added over 6,000 customers this past quarter. Second, next-generation data center. Over the past year, we have continued to invest heavily in our data center portfolio, building upon our core networking foundation as customers look to Cisco for an open, programmable and automated infrastructure that accelerates application deployments and provides network services in an agile way. We are delivering technologies across physical, virtual and cloud-based deployments. In Q4, we launched our Tetration Analytics platform, providing complete visibility across the data center. Combining Tetration with Cisco Cloud Center, we can automate and orchestrate data center application workloads real-time between hybrid and private clouds, while enabling policy management with ACI. Our ACI family of products continued to see strong revenue growth in Q4, growing 36% at over a $2.3 billion annualized run rate. In addition, this past quarter marked our first full quarter with HyperFlex, our hyper-converged solution, and we already have approximately 500 customers, and over a quarter of these are net new to UCS. We're off to a great start, with a solid pipeline and strong customer feedback. Third, collaboration. This continues to be a consistent growth driver for us. Our strategy and highly differentiated portfolio, delivered both on-premise and from the cloud, enabled us in FY16 to grow revenue 9% to $4.4 billion. In Q4, we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid growth, with revenue growing 6%, and deferred revenue growing at 13%. Lastly, we continue to see great progress in our transition to software- and subscription-based models. I've mentioned the success we've had in this area in both security and collaboration, and overall, our product-deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33% in Q4. Our momentum here is strong, and we'll continue to accelerate this transition. Today's market requires Cisco and our customers to be decisive, move with greater speed, and drive more innovation than we've seen in our history. Today we announced a restructuring, enabling us to optimize our cost base and lower growth areas of our portfolio, and further invest in key priority areas, such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center, and cloud. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these actions back into the businesses, and we'll continue to aggressively invest to focus on our areas of future growth. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk you through more detail on our financials. Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value. First, on delivering profitable growth. We had another good quarter, with revenue growing 2% and non-GAAP EPS growing 9%. For the full fiscal year, we grew revenue 3%, and non-GAAP EPS 8%. For the quarter and full year, we expanded both our gross and operating margins. For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $48.7 billion, with product up 2% and services up 5%. Let me now walk through the details for Q4. Total revenue was $12.6 billion, up 2%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 5%. Switching grew 2%, driven by strength in data center switching, with continued momentum in ACI and the next-generation data center. Routing declined 6%, largely driven by the weakness we saw in Service Provider. Collaboration grew 6%, driven by continued strength of our TelePresence portfolio, which grew in the double digits, and continued solid performance of WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 13%. Data center declined 1%. Our hyper-converged offering, HyperFlex, is experiencing solid early uptake by our customers, led by its highly differentiated architecture. Wireless grew 5%, led by growth in cloud-based Meraki, partially offset by a decline in controllers. Security grew 16%, with deferred revenue growth of 29%. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 80% and 50%, respectively. SP Video declined 12%, driven by the weakness we saw in China this quarter. Services grew 5%, driven by our focus on renewals and attach. We continue to make solid progress in our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 8%, with product up 8% and services up 9%. And as Chuck mentioned, the portion of our deferred product revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses, grew 33%. From an orders perspective, total product orders grew 1%, with our book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run the business, Americas grew 3%, EMEA was down 3% and APJC grew 4%. Total Emerging Markets declined 6%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 2%. India was up 20%, while we saw declines in China of 12%. In terms of customer segments, it was good to see a return to growth in enterprise of 3%, as well as a solid performance in commercial of 5%. Public sector grew 1%, and Service Provider was down 5%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 was approximately $4.6 billion, up 1%. We drove strong profitability with expanding leverage in Q4. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 64.6%, growing 0.7 points, with product gross margin of 63.9%, up 0.7 points, and service gross margin of 67%, up 1.1 points. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.4%, up 1.3 points. We also saw good momentum and improvement in the profitability for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin for the year was 64.7%, an increase of 50 basis points, with increases in both product gross margin and service gross margin, up 0.3 points and 1.4 points, respectively. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31%, up 1.4 points. We remain disciplined, and focused on continuing to drive operational efficiencies and productivity. In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, up 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.56. For the full year, we had record non-GAAP EPS of $2.36, up 8%, while GAAP EPS was $2.11. Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments, in Q4, we announced our intent to acquire CloudLock, which has since closed, early Q1. The CloudLock acquisition will further enhance Cisco's security portfolio and build on our Security Everywhere strategy, designed to provide protection from the cloud to the network to the end point, and also aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services. We continued our strategy of investing in key growth areas including security, but also cloud collaboration and IoT, and we are committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price, to drive our growth strategy. Moving on to shareholder value, in Q4, we delivered operating cash flows of $3.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $65.8 billion, with $5.9 billion available in the US. We returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $800 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow grew 8% to a record $13.6 billion, with free cash flow of $12.4 billion. We returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 70% of our total free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually. To summarize, in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we executed well, despite a volatile environment. We focused on consistent, solid execution, driving profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We're making the tough decisions and key investments to drive strong financial performance over the long term, and continuing our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value. Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the first quarter of FY17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the first quarter of FY17 is as follows. We expect our revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1% year over year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q1 FY16. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60. The restructuring action Chuck discussed earlier will impact up to 5,500 employees, representing approximately 7% of our global workforce. We will take these actions starting in Q1 of FY17, and estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our GAAP financial results up to $700 million. We expect that approximately $325 million to $400 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of FY17, with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year. I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call. Thanks, Kelly. To wrap up, I want to summarize our priorities as we head into the year ahead, and why I'm confident about our opportunities. First, we expect to continue to execute against our strategic priorities, and drive profitability regardless of the market conditions. We are committed to making the necessary decisions to drive our future growth and that of our customers and our partners. Second, we believe we will transition more of our revenues to a software- and subscription-based model, and accelerate our shift across our portfolio. Third, we remain committed to increasing our pace of innovation that will help our customers succeed. Lastly, we will continue to execute on our of long-term strategy to create even greater value for our customers and shareholders, while positioning Cisco for long-term success. Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you for questions. Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Sam is doing that, I would like to remind the audience that we ask you to please ask one question.","Thanks, Vijay. So I'll provide some comments and ask Kelly for anything else that she'd like to add. So when you look at, in Q4, what we obviously saw was, after three quarters of growth in the Service Provider and emerging countries, we saw those turn negative, as I said. And the rest of the business was up 5%, from an orders perspective. We also highlighted the fact that enterprise was up 3%. A little more color on that is that every geography around the world experienced positive enterprise growth. Commercial was up 5%. Every geography around the world experienced positive growth in commercial. And then in public sector, it was up 1% and I believe all except perhaps Europe were positive as well, in public sector. So outside of SP and emerging, we saw fairly consistent demand. And I think that pretty much summarizes it. Kelly, what other comments do you have? No, I think you summarized it well. Absolutely, Ittai, thank you very much. So on the UCS front, we talked about a couple things. There's an overall sort of macro demand issue in that space. I think the overall blade market has been somewhat benign. But we've also had -- we've also experienced, as we talked about, a transition to rack, and our teams have been working on subsequent innovation across both the blade and the rack business, as well as the introduction of the HyperFlex system. So we have -- I believe the team has a real clear plan. They've got innovation priorities outlined across all of those platforms, and we'll be executing that over the next few quarters. Kelly and I actually reviewed this just a couple days ago. So I feel good about the leadership there. I feel good about their plan, and now it's about execution. Kelly, any -- on the Tetration front, let me give you a little color, and then Kelly, you can talk about where we're going to report it. Tetration is -- we announced it in Q4. We're generally beginning orderability, I think, sometime around now. It is a combination of premise-based hardware with subscription software. And so, we're just very much in the early days. We have taken a couple of orders from customers. I will tell you that the general feedback from our customers is that it solves a problem that they've had for a very long time, that nothing else has solved. So again, we've got that offer ready to go in a combination of premise-based and subscription-based solution, and it is just being turned off on an orderability perspective. Where will we report that? Right now, since it is in the data center solution, it will be in data center switching. As we expand that portfolio across we can (inaudible). We'll call it out. Yes. Yes, so I'll start, and Chuck, you can jump in. But to your first question, the portion of our business that is recurring revenue is up to 28%, and that compares to 25% in Q4 of 2015. So we made really solid progress this year. In terms of the margins, this has been a huge focus for us all quarter long, and it is really great to see that we actually had our margins -- gross margins and operating margins -- up year over year for us this year. It's part of what we're driving in our shift to software. Those businesses have great margins, and it's part of the overall transition. In terms of, when do we change our model or our guidance, I think that will come over time as we make bigger shifts at the Company level. But that is our goal, as we shift to more software that have those nice, great margins. The only other comment I'd make is that when we look at our success relative to subscription and software businesses, we have the product-deferred revenue that's associated with software and subscriptions, that we said was up 33%. We also have another category of total contract value that we have not recognized revenue on yet that we will be billing customers on, on a monthly basis going forward. We track both those numbers. The second one doesn't show up on our balance sheet yet. But if you look at those two combined, which is really reflective of our progress here, that number was actually up 43% over the same period a year ago, just to share one more data point there. I'll make some initial comments and again pass it to Kelly. Tal, good questions. Primarily, we are looking at the areas of growth that we believe will grow faster than others. So it's more of a relative statement than it is an absolute statement. At the same time, we actually are working very diligently on bringing innovation to our core. We're focused on a tighter coupling of security into the core. We're focused on policy and orchestration and cloud-based management across the entire portfolio. So there is a significant amount of innovation the teams are working on there over the next several quarters as well. So it's not that we're ignoring one in favor of another. We just want to make sure that our of investments are commensurate with the growth opportunity from a relative perspective. Kelly? I think you said it well. We are investing in basically every business unit we have, right? So we're investing in the core and key areas. We're looking for those pockets of where the growth is, whether it's in core routing and switching or security and collaboration. So we're being very smart about where we're putting our money, and that's how we're looking at this. I'll give a couple of macro comments here. So we obviously, are calling out the weakness we saw from a demand perspective in Q4 relative to SP and emerging countries. We also -- obviously as we look forward, we're just uncertain how to model any improvement in those two, in particular, going forward. And the other issue is that there is some impact from the transition in our business model. I'll give you a quick example. We restructured and drove new value in how we put together certain Cisco One Software packages for our customers. And in Q4, as an example, there was about $139 million that would have been recognized as revenue that, because of the way we have now structured those offers and the value the customers see in those, those are going to transition to ratable revenue recognition. So there is a slight impact from that as we look forward as well. And those are the key things that led us to our guide. Yes, and just on -- the only thing to add to that -- again, we base it on what we see, and again, we did see the additional slowdown in SP and emerging. That makes us a bit cautious. On the margins, Steve, we're going to be driving as much as we can in those margins, and we'll be working that. But as of right now, this is what we see. Yes, James. You're correct in that over 50% of our routing business comes from Service Providers. So there's a direct correlation there. And I think if you look at the discussions that have are have taken place with our peers, you look at some of the analyst reports on SP CapEx, we actually saw exactly what the analysts have talked about. I saw one report that discussed double-digit declines outside of the United States, and maybe flat to slightly up inside the US, which is effectively what we saw from a demand perspective. So it was very much in line with that. As far as what we see going forward, look, we certainly don't expect that these networks over time, that the traffic will decline. So I think it's a matter of timing. The video loads on the networks continue to increase. So we would think about it the same way you do, but we also know that in uncertain times, that customers tend to sweat assets as long as they possibly can. Thanks, Jim. Well, I'll tell you, after the first year in this job, I know for a fact that every month there are new things that we face. And the good news is we tend to execute well and we deal with those. As it relates to -- first off, let me just say, in the EMEA business, the decline there was largely attributed to Service Providers. So I just want to make that clear. We would not suggest that the broad-based shift in the EMEA results was solely dependent upon Brexit. What we saw from a Brexit perspective is exactly what you would expect. In the UK proper, we saw customers pause. We saw them just kind of slow a bit because they're uncertain. And we also saw the impact of the currency devaluation, which you would expect. But we remain very committed there. We think we'll work through this. But those are the real impacts. On the Ericsson front, I'll tell you that the partnership continues to move forward, and there was really no correlation or discussion of the Ericsson partnership as it related to the decision on restructuring. We think that, again, that the original benefits that we saw with that partnership, with their global scale for services, their OSS capabilities, their radio expertise, combined with our IT expertise in data center and security, and other of capabilities, as well as the enterprise and IoT, were really the drivers there. So we see that continuing. As it relates to the cloud impact, I think when we look at sort of next-generation data center build-out in the private cloud, we look at our ACI portfolio, and we saw a $2.3 billion annualized business that grew 36%. So we feel like customers continue to move towards a hybrid cloud environment. The orchestration capability that we talked about with cloud center, which is from the CliQr acquisition, combined with the knowledge that we're going to be able to provide the customers through Tetration. So think about Tetration providing analytics about what's going on, CliQr and ACI then being able to deploy policy and move workloads between public and private cloud. And that's what we think customers are going to look for, and we think we're in a pretty good spot there. Yes, so I'll take that. So on the gross margins, we do have seasonality of when different mix of our products are bigger. For example, data center and services are bigger in Q2 and Q4, so you can see that normal seasonality in there. As I said to the earlier question, I think from an overall perspective, we feel great about our gross margins. We are being smart about the tradeoff on top line and bottom line, and the teams continue to do great work in terms of driving productivity and costs out of the products that allow us to do that. From a pricing perspective, our price ASP price erosion that we saw in Q4 was basically in line with what we saw in Q3 -- actually, 20 basis points better. So we're still in that same range; we're not seeing any change there. In terms of acquisition revenue, we don't typically disclose that, but I can tell you it was roughly less than a point. Yes. Thanks, Jess. On the web scale players, what we reported in the last couple of quarters was our top-10 web scale customers, and that business was up 2% this quarter. But it is a -- when you have 10 customers in sort of a reporting segment like that, it's highly dependent upon ordering cycles. So I'm not concerned about our relevance or anything relative to that. On the switching business, I think it's important to understand a couple things. Number one, your question relative to the ACI portfolio, and has it exceeded the traditional portfolio, I think we -- the answer to that is, yes. And our orders there were -- I think grew in the data center switching business, were up mid single-digits. Yes, in the revenue, on the revenue side, yes. On the revenue side. And so that transition continues to go well, and we see customers that are investing in new cloud-ready architectures, are choosing the ACI platforms, which is showing in the results. When you look at our overall switching portfolio, it's just important to understand the math on what percentage of that business is still attributed to our campus portfolio. And as we said, any time we have these macro -- these environments where customers have any level of uncertainty, that tends to be an area that they will continue to sweat, if they can. And our job over the next several quarters is to drive innovation in that portfolio, integrate security more tightly, and again, focus on orchestration policy and helping our customers lower their costs. And that's what we're going to try to do. Yes, you know, I think that's a great question, Jayson. If you go back to -- I think that was back in June of 2015, was our last financial analyst conference, it has changed quite a bit. Our transition has accelerated, that we've been accelerating. And I'd say the other major change from that long-term guidance was certainly our expectation of the data center business, and that market has changed. So I'd say there is no long-term model change per se right now, but we're in the process of planning an analyst conference hopefully at the end of the calendar year here, and we'll update that. But I would say those are the two major assumption changes since we did that. Yes, Simon, thanks for the question. When I think about routing, I actually think about it in several different ways. Number one, you've got the SP traditional portfolio with Edge access and core, which we discussed earlier, which is largely just a consumption-driven cycle that we go through. In the enterprise space, we have this transition to software-defined wide-area networking, which we're very well-positioned in right now with our IWAN portfolio. And we're actually working on a key differentiator for us, which I think is, as our teams have built out the ability to really drive the next-generation secure Edge. With our cloud security capabilities, the combination of dynamically provisioning those branch solutions, with the ability to have robust cloud security and Edge security, is going to be a real differentiator for us. So we see that being another opportunity for us going forward in the routing space. And then finally, when we talk about the security and the security-driven refresh of our core, in Q4 we actually had a couple of customers -- I talked earlier in the opening comments about Stealthwatch Learning Networks. Which is effectively a machine-learning algorithm that runs at the edge of the network in the branch, and it actually does machine learning and a little bit of AI to determine normalcy for customers, and then flag for them when they see abnormal behavior going on. And we saw a couple of customers that actually made the decision to do a branch router refresh based on that capability, which we just launched in July. So we believe that there's innovation that we can bring that will lead us to a refresh opportunity in the core, and we think that's largely going to be driven around security. And we're seeing some real early examples. We need to see how it plays out, but we're seeing some early examples there. All right, Marilyn. Thank you very much. In wrapping up, I just want to summarize our priorities again as we think about the year ahead. First off, we're committed to executing against the financial model and against our priorities, regardless of the conditions of the market. And we're committed to making the decisions that are necessary to drive our growth, and also to fulfill the commitments and obligations that we made to our customers, partners, and shareholders. We also are pleased with where we are on the transition to software and subscription models, and you can assume that we'll continue to accelerate that over the next year. We also -- I believe we'll drive a greater pace of innovation than you've seen in the last several years from Cisco. Our teams are very excited. There's a lot of things going on. So we're very committed to driving innovation. And then finally, just to reiterate, our long-term strategy to create greater value for our customers and our shareholders, while ensuring that we're also making the decisions for Cisco's long-term success, will remain at the forefront. So I want to thank everyone for spending time with us today, and we'll look forward to talking to all of you soon. Marilyn?","Hi, thanks, Chuck. Kelly, Marilyn. My question is around demand trends. A lot of clients are asking me this since the press release came out. Help us with any color you can in terms of end markets, product categories, product cycles -- anything and everything on demand trends looking into the rest of the year? Thanks. Okay, Sam. Let's go ahead and tee up for the next question, please? Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Couple things from me. And Chuck, this is the same question I asked last quarter. Your UCS, your data center business, has now been stuck in range for seven quarters in a row. And I understand that HyperFlex has seen some traction, but how do we get that business back to growth again? What is the time line by which you think that could happen? And will you consider going after parts of the market that are maybe more margin-sensitive? And then just another small question there. The Tetration solution you introduced, can you just remind us in what product category in the future that will be included, and maybe some color on first comments from customers? Thanks, Chuck and Kelly. Sam, we'll go ahead and take the next question, please. Hi, thank you. I just had a clarification first, which is, what percent of the business right now is recurring software and subscription revenue? And then as far as my question, gross margins and operating margins were ahead of your target ranges, and that's in a quarter when gross margins are typically seasonally down. So just curious, Kelly and Chuck, about raising your target margin ranges over time? And just more broadly, how are you thinking about the tradeoff between margins and revenue growth? Next question, please? Hi, guys. My questions are about the restructuring program. Two things. First, are you -- you say that you're doing it in order to increase investments in growth areas versus areas that are not growing. Are you anticipating further declining growth rates, or any issues beyond what we're seeing now in the legacy areas, that prompt this kind of program? And second, when we talk about less lower-growth areas, these are your largest areas, so switches and routers. And the question is, how do you deal with -- how do you balance between the need to compete and the need to invest? And maybe you can give us some color on the restructuring and what you plan on doing? Thank you. We'll go ahead and take our next question, please. Thank you very much. Could you talk a bit more about the factors behind your first-quarter guidance? Revenue being flat is clearly below the recent growth rate, and the gross margin is also down a fair amount sequentially. So what do you attribute that to? Next question, please? Thank you very much. I just wanted a quick question. I think this ties into Service Provider. Routing was surprising to us, that it wasn't a little bit better, and I think that's probably attributable to Service Provider, and I want to make sure that's the case. And I guess I'd like kind of your view -- it seems like with new products in that category, that maybe that, that category at some point becomes pretty spring-loaded, as at least we would expect the valuation units to be shipped in and pent-up demand to develop. But I want to know if we're thinking about that correctly, and kind of how we should think about the router segment going forward? Thanks. Thanks, Chuck. Sam, we'll go ahead and take our next question, please. Thanks very much, I appreciate the opportunity. And congratulations, Chuck and Kelly, to your good results. My question is just one part and pretty simple. Regarding Brexit, you're one of the first major tech companies to report that have a full-month post of the Brexit event happening. Can you talk about, did that influence your visibility, your spending patterns or demand orders, or book-to-bill, or anything like that? Any push-outs, any hesitations? Chuck, you talked many times about uncertain economic times we're in. I was wondering, has it been compounded by Brexit, or was that kind of built in and you actually didn't see much of an impact? Thank you very much. Great, thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and take the next question, please. Yes, thank you, good afternoon. I wanted to ask a follow-up around the restructuring. Can you give us any sense, Chuck or Kelly, is there any benefit here from the early stages of the Ericsson relationship, allowing you to leverage that JV so that you can actually drive some of this restructuring? And does that imply there could be incremental restructuring down the road? And then my question is around the cloud. We keep getting a lot of questions around what is Cisco's exposure to the cloud in terms of, can you give us any sense around the percentage of revenue, at least to private cloud or public cloud deployments that you're serving, from an infrastructure perspective? Thank you. Sam, let's go ahead and take the next question, please? Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So my first part is kind of on the product gross margin. So it looks like it was actually down sequentially in July, and I think that's primarily due to selling more switching and routing. So does that mean in October quarter, you think that the mix is going to shift more to legacy kind of routing and switching, versus the remaining, I guess, call it, advanced portfolio? And then just one small one. What was the total acquisition revenue you guys got from all the acquisitions this quarter? Next question, please. Thank you very much. Hi, guys. I was hoping you could touch upon the activity you saw from some of your top cloud customers, to what degree you're continuing to see strength in that vertical? And then on the switching business, which saw a return to growth following several soft quarters, I was hoping you could help us understand to what extent ACI revenues are now greater than some of the legacy data center offerings? And presuming the mix of legacy in the data center is now smaller than ACI, would you expect the switching business overall to grow moving forward? Or are there offsets that could cause that to vacillate going forward? Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please? Okay, great. I wanted to ask about long-term revenue growth. I think, Kelly, 3% to 6% has been discussed in the past, but with the shift to software and subscription, and service provider uncertainty, that seems like a stretch. And I'm not asking for specific guidance, but is there some direction that you would suggest for our long-term models? Thanks, Kelly. We have one more question, time for one more question. Great, thank you very much. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about longer term on the routing business, specifically. What you laid out sounds like very much the cyclical challenges facing your peers, as well as weak carrier CapEx. But if you could help us understand some of the longer-term themes around what's going on in routing, and how that sector may grow and your business may grow. And I'm pondering the implications around sort of SDN, as well as some of the architectural shifts of putting more of the burden into the optical space. Thank you. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY17 first-quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 16, 2016, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact any member of the Cisco Investor Relations department.

CSCO,Q2 2016,2325,4330,1502,"Thanks, Kim.  Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second-quarter FY16 quarterly conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations.  I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be available on our website in the investor relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on the financial information section of our investor relations website. Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Please note that during Q2 on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP video-connected devices business to Technicolor. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP video CPE business from both the Q2, FY16, and historical results. We have provided Q2 FY16 and historical financial information for the SP video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call have been normalized in the same way. With that, I would like to go ahead and turn it over to Chuck. Thanks, Marilyn. We delivered a strong Q2 in a challenging macro environment. Recently, we've experienced one of the most volatile times in the global markets. This volatility led to a slowdown in spending impacting our business especially during the last few weeks of January as we closed our quarter. Despite this slowdown, we executed very well with total revenue growth of 2% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%, strong margins and operating cash flow up 36%. Our ability to deliver strong profitability in a challenging environment reflects the operating leverage we have created in our business over the last several years. Our portfolio is more strategic than ever to Companies and countries that are digitizing everything. As billions of things become connected creating massive amounts of data, Cisco is playing an increasingly critical role enabling our customers to drive their priorities with industry-leading security. Cisco is unique in our ability to connect everything for our customers from the sensor to the data center with security and analytics. As a result, our conversations are no longer just in IT. They have become prevalent in the C-suite and the boardroom. When I took this role two quarters ago, I discussed my focus on accelerating our innovation engine and portfolio transformation to execute on the opportunity ahead of us. I believe we are executing well, and I would like to highlight our momentum in four key areas. First, we are defining the next generation of networking, beginning with the data center with our ACI platform providing the automation and programmability for our customers most critical business applications with the scale, speed, and security they require. In just two years, we have built ACI to a $2 billion run rate business that grew once again last quarter over 100%. We are aggressively focused on winning in the 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig transition and firmly establishing our leadership in the next-generation data center. Second, security remains the most critical priority for our customers, and as everything connects, it makes the network even more relevant. As the largest security provider, we have been focused on driving the growth of this business while at the same time migrating our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. In Q2, not only did our security business grow 11%, but our security-deferred revenue grew 26%. Third, we saw double-digit growth in our cloud-based SaaS businesses, specifically WebEx, Meraki cloud networking, and security. You are seeing us move more of our portfolio to be delivered in both on-premise and cloud-based models, and we are aggressively driving this transition. And, fourth, we are using M&A to augment our internal innovation in key growth areas. In the last 12 months, we have added critical capabilities and talent in the growth areas of cloud, security, SaaS, IoT, and analytics. Our recently-announced acquisition of Jasper, combined with our other capabilities, is a strong example of how we will play a unique and strategic role in unlocking the value of IoT. We will enable our customers to monetize the data from the billions of sensors and connections with the security, speed, and reliability they have come to expect from Cisco. Our momentum reflects the uniqueness of our business model and our ability to weather volatility while accelerating innovation in key markets to drive our long-term growth. Now, I will turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials. Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value. Starting with delivering profitable growth, total revenue was $11.8 billion, up 2% with product revenue growth of 2% led by growth in security, routing, and collaboration. In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we are driving the next-generation data center architectures and are very pleased with our ACI momentum. The 4% decline in switching was largely driven by macro weakness in our campus business something that we have observed in the past during volatile times as customers pause spending decisions. We saw our routing business grow 5%, driven by double-digit growth in our CRS platforms with particular strength in mobility and web-scale service providers. Collaboration grew 3%, driven by a 17% growth in WebEx, partially offset by some slowdown in our unified communications business. Deferred revenues showed continued strength growing 15%. Our data center decline of 3% was also driven by a slowdown in spend. In addition, we have tough comparisons from Q2 2015 when revenue grew 40%. UCS continues to be a strong franchise for us and is a foundational piece of our next-generation data center stack. Wireless was flat as result of declines in our access [plane] controller business offset by strong growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform. SP video grew 37% larger driven by strength in China.  Security grew 11% with deferred revenue growth of 26%. We had strong growth in our advanced threat security and web security solutions which grew over 180% and 40%, respectively. We added over 2,000 customers on our amp advanced malware solution bringing the total customer base to over 10,000. Services revenue grew 3%, and we continued to show very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had a solid growth of 8% in total with product up 11% and service up 7%. The portion of our product-deferred revenue which is related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 34%. In total, product orders grew 2%.  Our book to bill was approximately 1. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was flat.  EMEA declined 1%, and APJC grew 17%. Total emerging markets grew 7% with the BRICs plus Mexico showing strength at up 70%.  With China up 64%, and India up 23%. Total emerging minus the BRICM countries was down 3%. In terms of customer segments, enterprise declined 2%, and commercial grew 4% -- both of which were impacted by macro uncertainty. Public sector was flat, and service provider grew 5%. We drove strong profitability with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.2% with non-GAAP product gross margin of 63.3%, and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 33% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.2%. We will remain disciplined with our operating expenses and portfolio management. From a profitability perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 8% with $0.015 attributable to a lower non-GAAP tax rate resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. From a GAAP perspective, EPS was $0.62. In addition to the typical reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, there were three material items to call out which we excluded from our non-GAAP results; The gain on the sale of the SP video CPE business, the impact of the settlement of federal tax audit, and prior-year fiscal-year impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. The total impact of these and other immaterial items was a benefit to GAAP EPS of $0.13. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 8%.  GAAP net income was $3.1 billion. Moving on to shareholder value. In Q2, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.9 billion, up 36%. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q2 were $60.4 billion with $3.9 billion available in the US. In the first half of FY16, we have returned $4.6 billion, or 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.5 billion of share repurchases and $2.1 billion of dividends. Today, we announced a 24%, or $0.05 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This represents a yield of approximately 4.6% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program raising the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $16.9 billion. This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter in a volatile macro environment. We saw good top line growth, strong profitability, and operating leverage. We continue to shift our business model to more software and subscription recurring revenue. Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the third quarter of FY16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Q3 does include an extra week which occurs every five to six years for us. We have factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. Although it is difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly a 2% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth along with approximately $40 million of incremental cost of sales and $110 million of operating expenses. The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP video CPE business from Q3 FY15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be [22%]. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.54 to $0.56. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.12. Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call. Thanks, Kelly. Let me quickly summarize.  While macro growth has clearly slowed, the speed with which technology is changing every industry and every country has not slowed, and we are moving full speed ahead. This speed, coupled with our innovation, strategic partnerships, and our M&A capabilities will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and lead into the future. On this front, I feel very confident, and that conviction about our future business is what led us to increase our dividend by 24%. My confidence in our future is confirmed every day by CEOs, Boards, and country leaders as we preview our strategy and road maps. They see the next-generation data center and cloud architectures we're building on UCS and ACI. They see our extensive security portfolio that protects them before, during, and after an attack. The see the IoT and analytics platforms that will enable them to act on and monetize data and connections, and they want us to be their strategic partner as they drive their digital agendas. They trust us.  They value our innovation, and they believe our portfolio is critical to their ability to execute on their vision. Our customers and countries around the world know this move to digital is real, and it is happening now. As we help them through this transition, you will see us operate on two fronts. In the near term, you will continue to see us to be a well-run Company that executes even in challenging markets. Longer term, we will continue to make the right investments that will accelerate our growth as our customers embrace and adopt this next wave of technology. Marilyn, I will turn it back to for questions. Great.  Thanks, Chuck. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. While Kim is doing that, I would like to remind the audience that all analysts -- we ask you to please ask one question.","Pierre, thanks for the questions. Good to hear from you. On the macro front, I think the thing that I can tell you is that as we began last quarter, we certainly have a set of expectations as we have run our business for a long time and really know what to expect, and our expectations were obviously based on the discussions we had with all of you at the end of our first quarter. I would tell you that through the first 10 weeks of the quarter that was very much in line with what we expected. We were executing very much in line with how we would have expected the quarter to go. Our week 10 -- just so you have the data point was the end of the calendar year.  So, while a number of companies have reported earlier this year, not many have actually had their quarter end in January.  So, we ended at the end of the third week of January which we all know those first three weeks were reflective of the uncertainty that occurred in a lot of the financial markets. What I will tell you is that after week 10 through those three weeks, we saw customers as they were trying to digest what was going on. They paused a bit, and you see customers say -- I want to just wait and see what is going on.  Let me take a look at this.  We want to understand this a little better.  I think to Kelly's point when she talked about the switching business, the campus refresh opportunities that have been actually pretty consistent for us over the last few quarters, we saw customers say, hey, our infrastructure is working so we're going to hold on that for some period of time and let's see where things go. That is probably the extent that I can add to what we all know from what we're seeing every day. What I would tell you -- and I will ask Kelly to comment on our guidance -- is I would say that we took that feeling of those first three weeks into consideration as we built our guidance.  And, that is what we based it on.  Is what the last three weeks of last quarter led us to relative to this level of uncertainty. Kelly, any comments? I think -- to your question, Pierre. I think Chuck summarized it well. When we do our guidance, we look at everything we know at the time which is our funnel, the momentum we see, and everything else. I would say to put it in the words you use, I would say that our guidance is prudent. I think you see that we expanded our range to 3 points of range versus our normal 2 because I think it is more volatile than normal.  So, I would go with prudent based on what we see right now. Thanks, Vijay.   I would say the initial question you asked relative to the difference between the enterprise and the service provider space, I think what we saw was that our customers were spending in areas that are incredibly mission-critical for them even in these times where there is uncertainty.  So, you see them continuing to spend in security.  You see them continuing to spend in the next-generation data center evolution which was indicative of the 100% growth we saw in that portion of our portfolio.  And, I think we saw customers where they had the option to wait, they chose to wait a bit.  So, I don't view it as -- I don't see any fundamental issues relative to the enterprise portfolio or things like that.  I think that it was largely a prioritization effort that we saw within our customer base on the enterprise side. The service provider side, I think if you go back a couple of quarters, what I said was that our teams have been working hard to really get to alignment with our customers around the future of the industry, the future of their architectures.  How they were going to evolve to position them for the opportunities ahead, and I think we did that.  And, I would say that our teams have really executed well over the last couple of quarters as they align with our service providers on those priorities across the portfolio. We are pleased with where we are.  I don't think that if you really unpack those numbers over two or three quarters that you are going to see -- you'd be able to delineate a whole lot between what went on with the exception of the enterprise customers prioritizing where they spent their money. As it relates to the OpEx versus CapEx move, I will ask Kelly and maybe she can comment on the software part of the question.  But, I didn't see any fundamental change this quarter in how our customers look at that versus what they have been doing for the last three, four, five, six quarters.  It's something that we deal with as it relates to -- as an example, our collaboration portfolio, we made announcements last quarter that all of that portfolio, the entire portfolio, is now available.  Or, we announced that it will be available to our customers from both an on-premise and a cloud-based perspective.  And, in many cases, it will be a hybrid model. To the extent that our customers would like to procure our solutions in that way, then we will make that available to them. Kelly? I think you summarized it well.  On the software shift, Vijay, we are making great progress. Whether it is internal -- we talk about how we're driving that in our software and SaaS businesses within collaboration and security.  But also, in other parts of our portfolio, we are really developing new offers.  There are ways to monetize our services and software along that way so we will continue to disclose more especially as we look at our business and it becomes a bigger part of that.  So, I'd say it is progressing well, and we're adding to our models with acquisitions like OpenDNS and Jasper which are both SaaS models.  We will continue to build that out as it becomes a bigger part of our portfolio. On the IT to OpEx, just to add to what Chuck said, I would say one thing that we have tremendous flexibility on is leveraging our great balance sheet to help provide solutions for whatever it is.  So, whether it is our Cisco capital offers or for the ability of us to build managed service as a service -- those kind of offers.  We are very active working with our customers that want different ways to consume our products and services differently that we're coming up with all kinds of new solutions for different ways of consumption.  And, we have that flexibility because of our strong balance sheet.  I'd say we're making a lot of progress on both of those accounts. Simona, on the 2%.  Great question.  Let me give a little context there.  Back -- the last we had this was in Q3 of FY10, and it was about a 4% to 5% increase. I would say, what I've baked into my 2% -- so it's roughly about $250 million to $275 million. What I've baked in the guidance is the incremental revenue I know that we will get from things like our services subscription businesses, our SaaS businesses, as well as some product flow-through on the distribution that we're seeing. That is what I baked into the guidance. I am not assuming there is going to be a lot more because of the current macro environment.  The sales guys are out there.  The teams driving to a monthly number and a quarterly number and given the spending constraints that we're seeing right now, I'm not being over-bullish in my guidance on that. That is how I built [that] up.  Just to remind you, back in Q3 of 2010 -- our growth that quarter was 27% so it was a much different macro environment. Simona, the second part of your question.  I think the word that we would use relative to how Kelly modeled in that would be the same that we talked about with Vijay which would be prudent. On the switching front from a revenue perspective, it was negative this quarter. We're trying not to give you lots of random pieces of information every quarter so that we can build some consistency in how you look at how we are performing.  But, I will tell you that on the new order side on the data center switching business this quarter we did see slightly positive growth on orders.  And, I would say in the context of that last three weeks that we felt in enterprise that we are cautiously optimistic. Jim, first of all, thanks for your favorable comments.  I appreciate that. On the Ericsson front, we have seen -- I will tell you that we have never seen --.  Outside of Apple, we have never seen a partnership that has gotten so much energy and excitement inside the Company.  And, as you know on the Apple front, we are actively doing the development.  I think Tim alluded to it on his conference call that we are -- both Companies are doing the development that we need to do to actually deliver that join innovation to our customers. But, the Ericsson partnership has immediate opportunity with it, and we have begun to close transactions together. I would not translate that to a significant impact to any of the numbers that we put out there today because we are literally in the handful stage right now. But, we do see that accelerating. We have a lot of focus on it with our teams.  Hans, their CEO and I are going to be together quite a bit.  Mobile World Congress in a couple of weeks, and we're also going to have a lot of the next-generation joint solutions that we are putting together for our customers that will be on display in both of our booths there.  Hans and I are actually on a panel together at mobile world.  That partnership is going probably as well as we thought it would be at this point, and I think you will really see the acceleration over the next 12 months. I will speak to some of the areas of strength, and I will let Kelly talk about the numbers and how we think about it going forward. We did see strength in our core routing, and we saw strength in enterprise access routing this past quarter. We have some new products in our portfolio that are very early.  One of them was the co-development effort that I had talked about over the last couple of calls that we would expect to see some positive momentum out of over the next few quarters. We have got some virtualized routing capabilities that our teams are working on.  I think the portfolio looks good.  The pipeline looks good from an innovation perspective.  And then, Kelly, any comments on how we think about the numbers going forward? I think you summarized it well, Chuck. I think we feel fantastic about the portfolio, and we feel good about what it looks like.  But, I don't really give guidance by business unit because there's a lot of volatility.  But, I would say we feel really good about how the portfolio is sitting and the new products that we have launched on that -- in that platform. Thanks, Brent. On the pause that we saw, this is typical.  When there is uncertainty in the market, we see enterprise customers and they just basically say, let's just wait.  Let's see what's going to happen.  They may say, let's wait a week.  They may say, let's wait a couple of weeks.  When you're in the last three weeks of your quarter, those kinds of decisions have an impact.  I just want to clarify. Your specific question.  We saw it pretty holistically around the globe.  And then, the other thing that we haven't really talked about is obviously outside of the United States we saw currency -- we talked about it on the last call -- in Europe and Asia that clearly continued and maybe even get a little worse in some places. On the APJC recovery, the team there has done a great job. We've talked a lot about what we have seen happening in India.  We have seen tremendous success there. That is one of the key countries that we have a country digitization effort that John has been leading for us, and our business there continues to grow very well. In China, which is the crux of your question.  I would tell you that as we've navigated our way through the last three years, and I think, Brent, you and I have talked about the amount of time that I spent over there during that window.  The team did a great job, and what they really did is they diversified our business strategy across customer segments.  So, not only being aligned to state on enterprises but moving out and creating a commercial market strategy.  Moving out into second and third-tier cities, so geographic diversification.  And, they really focused on their teams being able to sell our entire portfolio. The good news is what I will tell you is that the growth we saw in China was very well balanced across our portfolio. We saw routing up -- Kelly, keep me honest.  But, routing in double digits.  Switching in double digits.  Wireless in double digits as well as SP video in double digits. It was a very balanced performance for the second quarter in a row. There's clearly a lot of uncertainty out there so we're going to take things a quarter at a time, but we are pleased with where they are. Thanks, James. Let me comment on the M&A activity that you have seen.  We have built a strategic framework that is guiding us for what we believe we need to have in our portfolio and the architectures that we need to be able to build relative to cloud security analytics, SaaS, IoT.  We have built that framework with our team in the first two or three months that I was in the role. We then stepped back and looked at where do we have R&D activities that are going to fill some of those opportunities and where are there opportunities like what we saw with Jasper where we can move and actually fill a substantive portion of our portfolio. That is what is driving us.  It is very much connected to our broader strategy and connected to what I believe our customers care about in the future.  I would say that you should expect us to continue the pace, and obviously valuations in today's market -- that is one piece of good news is that they're more attractive. As it relates to security -- on the security front, I would say that it is primarily -- and Kelly can again keep me honest on the deferred piece of this -- if it is flowing through.  But, what we talked about was the integration of the Sourcefire assets as well as the Cisco assets as well as other acquisitions we made along the way plus the other innovation that our teams internally have done.  And, that has -- we put all that together about two quarters ago, and we told you that we thought that this would continue to improve.  And, our teams have driven that. When you look at that advanced malware portfolio, we added yet another 2,000 customers this quarter.  So, we're up to 10,000 which is they've really done a great job of executing on that strategy. During the quarter, we also launched our next-generation firewall product that we need to get out in the marketplace for obvious reasons. We're hoping for similar success.  But, I think primarily it is because of continued improvement in the portfolio and the work our team has done. I wouldn't suggest that there is a significant revenue impact coming back in from the deferred yet although we are seeing -- . That is what we expected.  What we said a couple of quarters ago.  That ramp that we talked about two quarters ago is happening in addition to the growth that you are highlighting in just the core businesses. Jess, I'm surprised we got this far in the questions before someone asked about data center so I was beginning to worry. We track that business very closely, obviously, and largely what we believe is that it is connected to the broader macro issue. That data center business has a strong buying season that actually runs into the end of December, and while it is a fantastic franchise for us that has contributed and will contribute to not only our success in the data center in the past but also in our success in the next-gen data center as we build next-generation data center stacks going forward.  But, it also -- we also believe that in the December quarter that we actually still gained share with that performance. We had a tough comp from a year ago -- 40%.  But, I will tell you the other thing that we looked at is even with the lower performance, it still remained the same percentage of our business this quarter that it was last quarter that it was a quarter a year ago which says that it just in my mind it says it suffered at the same rate that the rest of the business did from the macro. Kelly, second part of the question? On capital allocations.  Overall, our strategy around capital allocation hasn't changed. We want to give a minimum of the 50% back to our shareholders. We've been listening to our shareholders, and the bottom line is we feel very, very good about our business model and our ongoing cash flows.  You saw our operating cash up 36% this quarter that we thought we would increase the amount of our dividend sustainably going forward. It is a blend. We also increased our authorization just as we would normally would increase our authorization -- the $15 billion. In terms of flexibility, yes, we will be accessing debt in the near future.  Again, that is one of the benefits of our balance sheet and our access to capital.  It is very, very good so we will continue to do that until anything changes with our overseas cash.  But, it does not change our flexibility in any way in terms of acquisitions. When we think through these capital allocation decisions, we're playing out what we're thinking about acquisition-wise.  How we're building that out as well as our future cash flow. I think, no change to our acquisition strategy.  It does not hamper us in any way.  We have easy access to capital, and again, wanted to share some of that cash back with our shareholders. On gross margins, we continue be very focused on margins, and we look at it as all the different levers in there. As you know, we continually have some price erosion, and we use price as a lever to drive selling.  Our price erosion has remained very, very disciplined. You'll see that it has been in the normal ranges that we have been in the last quarter and actually slightly better than a year ago.  So, that continues. We're getting real traction -- continued traction from our engineers and supply chain on the productivity side.  So, for the price erosion we have, we are more than offsetting it with productivity, and we're continuing to drive those projects to continue to do that so we can have the flexibility to make sure we're taking advantage of all opportunities for growth out there. That is continuing. On the operating margin side -- again, we're are going to be smart about managing the overall equation. We want to make sure we're taking advantage and investing in the right areas to be able to take advantage of future growth and balancing that equation. There is a bit of good [news] coming through at the OM line because of FX favorability that you are aware of that falls through the bottom line.  But, in general, I would say that we're being very disciplined in terms of how we make these trade-offs and balance the bottom line with the investments we're trying to make to accelerate growth. On the extra week, this is how I think you can think about it.  I tried to be pretty transparent of what we are assuming in there so literally the $250 million or so, the $275 million that we're assuming literally is just the businesses where it is just because we have weekly billing it is going to amortize off our balance sheet.  That is basically a guarantee. Just marginally a little bit more for some of the distribution flow business. I would say as you are modeling for Q4, I think you should assume the normal ranges.  Take that out -- that $250 million to $275 million and assume the normal ranges of growth in Q4. On the software and SaaS.  I know you and others ask me this question a lot, and it is tough to quantify.  Certainly, it is 1 point or 2 easy to say, off the top. Some of the businesses we're growing -- our businesses that we've had that are great like [collaboration] and security.  We are adding more to this profile with some of these different offers.  These big enterprise ELAs that we have. It is hard to quantify for any one quarter, right, of when it is going to fall in.  But, there is certainly something on the top line, but we will see that come back through as we continue to build that out and amortize it. Simon, thanks.  This is Chuck.  On the SP video front, I think that the team has done a great job of evolving that portfolio and really building some great solutions.  They're engaged with lots of customers. Our strategy when we divested of the video CPE business was to really focus on a cloud-based delivery model, and that is occurring.  We're having obviously good success with that platform in China. That tends to be an ongoing -- a longer-term solution that the customers deploy.  So, we will see.  Again, we're taking things quarter by quarter, but we feel good about where they are there. On the second part of your question, relative to the web-scale guys.  We have talked the last couple of quarters about how we had been having success with them.  And, I talked about us really changing our strategy about 18 months ago and moving more into a collaborative, co-development mode with them thinking about what they're very unique needs are.  I will tell you that our business with them last quarter grew 17% so we continue to see relatively good strength with those customers. Tim, it is good to hear from you, and that is a very good question. What I would tell you is that we are currently -- we have a lot of work going on around the future -- the next-generation data center and what the future stacks look like in that data center which will be a combination of infrastructure hardware with a heavy dose of software and orchestration.  And, you can assume that we're looking at our role up and down that stack going forward. I would tell you that there was a recent article, I think late last week in InfoWorld where [Barry Sing] actually outlined how we are thinking about this market.  So, you are spot on, and we are spending a lot of time thinking through what role we play there and what the opportunity is.  But, we believe it is going to be significant. Appreciate the question. Tim, thanks.  That was apparently the last question we have.  I'm going to close with some short comments. I am incredibly pleased with how we executed this quarter, as I said, in a very uncertain macro environment.  Our teams did a great job, and as we look forward, I think about how we're operating the Company on these two fronts. The first front is that we will continue to execute and run this Company in a well-managed way even in challenging environments, but at the same time, we're going to move full speed ahead. The second front is that we are going to make the long-term investments and build our strategy and the architectures and the solutions that our customers need, and I believe that our growth will accelerate as our customers embrace and move towards this next wave of technology that is going to fundamentally change every Company and every country around the world. I believe we can do both.  I think that will allow us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity ahead of us, and I have a great deal of confidence in our ability to execute against that. Thank you for spending time with us today, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks, Chuck.   Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY16 third-quarter results will be on Wednesday, May 18, 2016 at 1.30 PM Pacific time, 4.30 PM Eastern time. Again, I would like to remind the audience that in light of regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, please for free to contact the Cisco investor relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.","Chuck, what I would like to understand is your perspective on the macro environment?  So, first of all -- you, of course see Bloomberg TV and read the Financial Times as we all do.  But, what can you see through Cisco if you get feedback from your channel?  From your sales force?  Your country managers?  What do they really tell you about and what color can you bring us that we do not necessarily see from where we are?  And also, on the same front on the macro environments, your guide for next quarter -- what kind of macro scenario have you baked in?  Would you qualify that as prudent -- very prudent?  And, if you can take us through the thought process of how you came up with that guidance that would be very helpful? My question is around is Cisco a tale of two cities here?  We're seeing enterprise products turning light versus consensus while your service provider product -- routing, video et cetera -- are beating expectations. I would like to get your view on this enterprise versus service provider dichotomy, if any? And then, you have a bigger picture strategy around software and your cutting services fully believing that strategy and model.  My question is really around do you see IT spending queuing quickly toward OpEx versus the traditional CapEx model of spending?  How would Cisco [deliver] to this higher than usual OpEx IT spending moving forward? I just wanted to clarify first, Kelly, in terms of the 2-percentage-point bump that you've embedded into the guidance for the extra week that compares to 4 to 5 points that you saw last time you had this kind of pattern back in 2010.  I just wanted to understand if there's anything different this time?  Or, if that is just an extra measure of conservatism?  And then, just more for the substantive question, Chuck.   I heard your comments on the pause on the campus-switching side of the business.  I wanted to also ask what is happening on the data center side of your switching business?  Is that returning to growth in the first half of this calendar year as you had expected it to?  Any update there would be helpful. My question is now that it has been a few months with the new partnership in Ericsson, can you let us know if you've actually had any concrete wins or anything you can [point to] showing up in the NGN segment of reporting?  Or, is it too early to see?  Or, any anecdotes about that new partnership? Just wanted to see if you can give us a little more context about how we should think about the routing glide path going forward in the next few quarters given the nice growth you generated this past quarter. How much of it is related to the CRS cycle continuing?  Does it have to do with more vertical penetration or service provider penetration?  Any color you can give us?  I'm trying to understand, can you still be in the 3% to 4% or 5% bogey for that business for the next couple quarters from a growth perspective? One clarification and one question, Chuck. Could you clarify, was the pause you saw with customers the last couple weeks.  Was that global, or was that concentrated in the Americas?  And, my question is really around APJC, the recovery you are seeing there?  The recovery you are seeing in China?  What is driving that? Is that sustainable?  Is that easy compares?  Walk us through what you are seeing in APJC that drove the rebound this quarter?  And, I guess -- A, is it sustainable? A couple of quick questions.  First on acquisitions.  You have been fairly active in the last few quarters.  Should we expect this type of pace to persist, both in terms of tuck-in acquisitions and maybe more detailed acquisitions?  And then, the second question I had was security -- it seemed like there was some acceleration in that business this quarter. Is that just the result of the SaaS model starting to accrue to the P&L?  Or, was there underlying improvement in the billings and activity in that business? Two quick ones.  First, for Chuck.  I was hoping you could provide some additional details regarding the weakness in the data center business?  What changed there?  How you expect that to progress moving forward? And then, for Kelly, with respect to capital allocation.  It seems like you have a little bit less than $4 billion in US cash yet you materially raised the dividend and the buyback.  I was hoping to understand if we should be expecting a debt raise?  And, to what degree this means any acquisitions we may see are likely to be on the smaller side?  Thanks. I have a few margin questions, Kelly, for you perhaps.  Can you talk a little bit about the drivers inside of the gross margin structure?  It was a little bit ahead of plan this quarter.  It seems to be going back to the norm next quarter.  What are the moving parts there? The second part of that is on the operating margins.  I know 30% is the target.  When should we be thinking about that?  How much progress are you making in that regard? I wanted to think a little bit ahead, Kelly, just given this extra week that you had in the guidance. Historically as you move into your fourth quarter, you typically post a solid sequential increase quarter over quarter. As we lose this week, should we assume a little bit more of a flattish performance then into July versus April?  And then, regarding the software in SaaS, clearly you're making very good progress over there. Is there a way to quantify from your standpoint how much of growth are you giving up right now as you transition businesses, more and more of your products into those type of purchasing model?  How much of a growth headwind this transition is impacting you near-term? Quick clarification.  Strength in service provider video, I think you highlighted China. If you could just talk to what you think the duration is?  And then, in terms of market verticals, I was interested if you could talk a little bit more about your exposure to what we have often called Web 2.0 or web-scale operators?  Certainly, there is the idea that they buy white box, but we know you sell to them. I would like to get a sense of your exposure and the trends from that group of customers if we might? Chuck, maybe just to go back to the data center, if we could.  I get the macro and the tough compares there.  Just looking more broadly at that market, I think though the share gains are starting to normalize a little bit at least in the server market.  So, when  you think about the continued growth on the hardware side of the data center, do you think we need to broaden the server offering?  Maybe get more involved in storage or ADC or some other products that are important to the data center that Cisco might not fully be participating in?

CSCO,Q3 2016,2226,4027,1908,"Thanks, Kim. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's third-quarter FY16 quarterly conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll also discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2 on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP video connected devices business, and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 FY16. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP video, CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q2 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. With that, I will turn go ahead and turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn. We delivered strong Q3 results against the back drop of a macro environment that continues to be uncertain. Despite this uncertainty we executed very well, with revenue growth of 3% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 6%. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of over $3 billion in the quarter, returning nearly $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our commitment to operating discipline continues to yield solid results in spite of the challenging environment. The operational changes we continue to make will further enable our customers to leverage the strategic role of the network as they transform their businesses to become digital. As I did last quarter, I'd like to highlight our momentum in four key areas. First, in security, we saw continued acceleration in the third quarter with revenue growth of 17%, while deferred revenue grew 31% driven by our ongoing shift from hardware to more software and subscription services. Our security business is tracking as we indicated it would earlier in the year. As one of the largest IT security vendors, we believe our portfolio is the most comprehensive and effective in enabling our customers to protect their businesses. Security is and will remain one of our absolute highest priorities. Second, collaboration, revenue accelerated by 10% and deferred revenue here grew 16%. This is yet another example of a successful transition to a cloud-based platform, increasing our market leadership, which we expect will give us sustainable long-term differentiation. Third, our next-generation data center portfolio is extremely well-positioned to meet our customers' needs regardless of where they place their work loads, enabling public, private or hybrid cloud employments. At our Partner Summit we received a very strong response to our innovations as customers adopt our next-generation data center solutions. Our strong position is evident in our install base of 52,000 UCS customers and the continued success of our ACI portfolio. In March we announced a dramatic improvement in price performance, and by this I mean 100-gig performance for 40-gig pricing, driven by new ASICs, which provide us a time to market advantage of 18 to 24 months, while maintaining the same margin profile. In Q3, our ACI platform grew revenue approximately 100%, while it exceeded a $2 billion annualized run rate, far outpacing our next closest competitor in both size of business and growth rate. Our entry into the hyper-converged market with HyperFlex, as well as our acquisition of CliQr, an innovator in multi cloud orchestration to extend our leadership position in the data center. Finally, we continue to make great progress in transitioning more of our revenue to recurring, with increased emphasis on software and subscription offers. Our software subscription deferred revenue balance continues to exhibit accelerated growth, this quarter up 36%. We have a number of strong proof points for how we've executed successfully against our objective and the potential to apply the same model to the rest of our portfolio. In addition to the success I've highlighted in our security and collaboration businesses, we had double-digit revenue growth again this quarter in Meraki, which stands out as an excellent example of how we've begun to scale our enterprise networking into a subscription model. As I look to the future, you will see us expand the approach we have taken with the success of Meraki, collaboration and security, and apply it to our data center and core networking for both enterprise and service providers. Our $180 billion of install base, with by far the most widely adopted operating systems for networking, makes us uniquely positioned to lead this migration. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are nicely positioned to benefit from any rebound in the global economy. At the same time we will continue to manage our business to capitalize on the key growth areas in front of us. I'm very pleased with our demonstrated ability to execute operationally and strategically in virtually any environment. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials. Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value. Starting with delivering profitable growth, total revenue was $12 billion, up 3%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 11%. We did have an extra week in Q3. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to revenue was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services, subscription businesses, and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx, as well as some from our product distribution. In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we continue to see good momentum with ACI in the next-generation data center. The 3% decline in switching was mostly driven by macro-related weakness in our campus business, offset by positive growth in data center switching. Routing experienced 5% decline, mostly driven by the high end. We are seeing continued strength with our web-scale customers where our co-development continues and our sales to the top 10 web-scale customers was up 31%. Collaboration grew 10% by strength across the entire portfolio, and deferred revenue grew 16%. WebEx continued its double-digit growth, with solid performance in telepresence and unified communications, driven by our new offerings in those areas. Data center grew 1%, with the slower growth largely driven by continued macro challenges impacting customer spend. We expect that our HyperFlex offering will further expand our growth opportunities in the data center. Wireless grew 1%, led by strong double-digit growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform, partially offset by declines in our controller and access point businesses. Security grew 17% along with continued strong deferred revenue growth of 31%. We had great performance in our advance threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 100% and 50%, respectively. SP video grew 18% with ongoing strength in China. Services revenue grew a very solid 11%, which includes the $200 million for the extra week I mentioned. Normalized for the extra week the growth was 4%. We again saw very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had solid growth of 8% with product deferred revenue up 9% and service up 7%. The portion of our product deferred revenue relating to our recurring software and subscription business grew 36%. From an orders perspective, product orders grew 3% with a book to bill comfortably above 1. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas grew 4%, EMEA was up 2%, and APJC grew 1%. Total emerging markets grew 4%, with the BRICs plus Mexico showing strength up 4%, and China up 22%, and India up 18%. Brazil and Russia continue to be challenged and now combined representing less than 2% of our total product bookings. In terms of customer segments, enterprise declined 2% and commercial grew 8%. Public sector grew 6% and service provider was flat. Similar to Q2 we are seeing pressure in the enterprise segment driven by the macro uncertainty. We drove strong profitability this quarter, especially with gross margins. From a non-GAAP perspective gross margin was 65.2%, with product gross margin of 64.5%, and service gross margin of 67.1%. Operating expenses were 35.2% of revenue, and operating margin was 30%. The total impact of the extra week on our non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses was $150 million. We're being very disciplined in this tough macro and pricing environment, focused on making the right investments, while driving operational efficiencies and productivity. From a bottom-line perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 6%, while GAAP EPS was $0.46. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 4%, while GAAP net income was $2.3 billion. We have been very active from an M&A perspective, closing five acquisitions in Q3: Jasper Technologies, making Cisco the largest cloud-based IoT service platform, helping enterprises and service providers launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale; Acano, which provides on-premise and cloud-based video infrastructure and collaboration software; Synata, which enables us to deliver search capabilities for collaboration cloud applications; Leaba, a fabless semiconductor company; and CliQr, which provides an application-defined cloud orchestration platform, which is expected to help Cisco customers simplify and accelerate their private, public and hybrid cloud deployments. These acquisitions are clearly focused on our key growth areas, including IoT, software, cloud and collaboration, as well as continuing to strengthen our core. We have also seen solid momentum with our Ericsson partnership, closing 17 deals this quarter. Moving on to shareholder value, in Q3 we delivered operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q3 were $63.5 billion, with $6.3 billion available in the US. We returned $2 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $649 million of share repurchases, and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend, which we increased by 24% in Q3. Overall Q3 was a very solid quarter in a difficult macro environment. We focused on strong operational execution, resulting in top-line growth, strong gross margins and continued operating leverage consistent with our expectations. We're making the right investments in the growth areas of the business, balancing our decisions with sound portfolio management. Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the fourth quarter of FY2016. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for Q4 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of zero to 3% year over year, normalized to exclude SP video CPE video from Q4 2015. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 or $0.11. Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call. I'll now turn it back over to Chuck. Thanks, Kelly. Let me quickly summarize before we move to questions. First, I think the number one key takeaway is that we continue to execute well, even in an obviously very tough environment. Secondly, we have proven our ability to transition certain elements of our portfolio, like we have done with Meraki security and collaboration, and we believe we can accelerate long-term growth by bringing this same approach to our core, and this process has begun. Finally, everything we do will be done through a lens of enabling our customer success while driving value for our shareholders. Marilyn, I'll turn it over to you for questions. Thanks, Chuck. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Kim is doing that, I'd like to remind the audience that we ask you to please ask one question.","I'll answer the second part, first, Simona. In terms of how much benefit we got from the extra week, we don't think there's much. What we saw this quarter was the forecast was pretty straightforward. The team saw deal closure and conversion rates drag on, especially in the enterprise segment. And, quite, frankly the deals that we closed were more in line. So, we don't think we had any upside from the extra week in bookings sitting there. In terms of your first question on the acquisitions, we'll start to see -- in the current run rate you have the bulk of, like OpenDNS and everything else. For the new acquisitions that you don't have a full quarter in the run rate, we'll get a bit of a benefit from Jasper and Acano, but it is not terribly material in the overall growth rate. Ittai, this is Chuck. Thanks for the questions. I'll answer the first one and I'll give Kelly the gross margin question. As we look at the data center business we see a few things going on. First of all, we think that there is an impact coming from the overall macro environment that is relatively undeniable. We also saw, as our peers have, some caution in, I would say, the CapEx spend in the SP space, and that was one of the segments that we saw weakness this quarter even with our data center portfolio. When we say data center in this context we're talking about UCS, in particular. The other thing that's going on is there is a transition going on in the data center relative to work loads. I talked a little bit about it on the last call. We see workload-specific use cases being deployed on high-performance blade systems like our classic UCS. Then we see also this move to hyper-converged systems, which led us to the launch of our HyperFlex platform last quarter. We also see a transition to rack-based systems which also result in stacks that are driven by container-based architectures. So in the past quarter 30% of our UCS business was actually from our rack portfolio, which we do have for the appropriate use cases. And you'll see us continue to expand our offerings. So we have UCS as a blade system. We have a rack version of UCS. We have HyperFlex in the market. And you'll see us continue to expand our portfolio to meet the evolving use cases in the data center. I think that's what's going on right now. Kelly, on the gross margin question? On the gross margins, I would say, Ittai, it is a couple things. You're absolutely right when you go back and look historically. If you go back and normalize, the biggest thing that we did was obviously when we got out of the set-top box business. That helped us quite a bit. And normalized, if you go to just Q1 of this year we were at a 64.9%, and we even in last year we had 65.1%. So, I would say it is the new normal in that 63%, 64% range. I would say the only other thing, when you go back and you update your models for the extra week -- because a lot of the top line that I talked about comes off the balance sheet and there's no incremental costs -- I did get a 0.5 point benefit just from the extra week in my gross margin. So, I would say a normalized view on the gross margin would have been closer to 64.5%. Vijay, I think the number one thing that I am feeling very positive about right now is, again, we have shown that we can drive the transition in our collaboration portfolio, which when you see that business over the last two years, the team has done a great job of transitioning it to a portfolio that is available to our customers as cloud-based services, and seeing it growing double digits and also growing our deferred revenue balance up 16%. I think that's one example. In security, 46% of our business now comes from software and subscription services, which is clearly the direction that we had indicated we were going to take it, at the same time growing 17%. Our Meraki business, which really shows the evolution of networking to cloud-based management and policy, is over $1 billion now and growing double digits. And I think the thing I'm most excited about longer term is that we see a path to deploying that model across the rest of our portfolio. And, again, that work has begun. I think in the near term we see, obviously a mix of a pretty cautious environment still, because we do see customers spending where they need to spend. But don't misunderstand, there is still a fair amount of caution in the market. But I think that we've executed well this quarter. We had five of our seven product categories that were in positive growth, with three of those in double-digits. We had all the geos in positive growth from an order perspective. And we saw pretty good strength across our segments. So that's the first question. The second one relative to security, the answer is yes, yes, and yes. We will continue investing both organically and any other way that we see appropriate to drive that architecture. The team has done a phenomenal job. Let me take the first one and then, Kelly, you can maybe make a connection from the services to the hardware. On the switching business I'll point out a couple things. Last quarter we indicated that our campus switching business, the growth there is largely driven by refresh, which in an uncertain time, enterprises that have infrastructure that's functioning for them, they're not going to make the move to upgrade. So, we see a pause in that refresh cycle, which we talked about last quarter, and nothing really changed there. What we did see is we saw our data center switching revenue growth increase. And the other thing that I'll point out is that we had indicated that we believe that our data center switching growth -- the new product portfolio would surpass the declines of the traditional products that we've had. And our order growth rate, which we haven't put in any of the documentation, our order growth rate this past quarter on that $4 billion portfolio was double digits. So we're pleased with the progress that we have made in the data center switching space. And, again, that's $4 billion and it grew double digits in orders. So, we feel okay about that. On the routing front it's a combination of things, I think that there's certainly --$1 billion in the quarter, $4 billion in annualized run rate on the data center switching -- Kelly is making sure we're clear. On the routing business, we've seen a few things. Clearly there is a macro issue that we're dealing with. We also saw, again, as you heard from some of our peers, we saw some increased caution in the service provider space. We saw slow movement in the core of those networks -- flattish activity at the edge. And we do have a number of new platforms that are in certification with several of the key players that we, at some point in the coming quarters, we would expect those to begin to show up favorably. But that's what we see right now. And then in terms of, Steve, your question on impact on the services business, typically for new sockets there would be a little lag for that. But I will say that our service business has been laser focused on driving renewals. So, even if enterprises are holding on to their switches and routers longer, our services team and sales team has been very focused on getting the contracts renewed. And we're seeing that pay dividends with the acceleration of growth. Again, if you normalize our service revenue growth this quarter for the extra week, they still grew 4%, which is up from 3% year-over-year growth in Q2 and it was 1% in Q1. So, we're really starting to get traction there. Steve, if I can just pile on to what Kelly just said, the team has been building out, trying to strengthen our capability around the entire software and subscription business model, which requires a lot of focus on adoption and renewals. We've also taken the same approach to just sharpen our focus on our services renewal business. And we did see improvement in that in the last quarter. So, I'm happy with the progress the team is making there, as well. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Jim. Again, the thing to keep in mind -- true, we did guide with the extra week which came in, in line -- but just, again, a couple things. When we guide we tend to have a little conservatism in the gross margin rate. But take off that 0.5 points, we're still parked at the 64.5% range. We do have normal seasonality quarter in and quarter out. So, always Q1 and Q3 are our strongest gross margin quarters, and Q2 and Q4 are weaker, and it is typically driven by our mix, especially mix of servers in those two quarters. That is also a driver. And I think, just operationally speaking, again, the teams are doing a very good job from a productivity perspective in terms of driving costs out of the product. We had a lot of efficiencies out of the supply chain in terms of managing our freight and our inventory management. So, I would say there has just been real -- we had a very strong quarter from operational excellence. If I look at pricing this quarter we are being very disciplined on pricing. We're starting to see a tiny bit of a tick up, and you'll see that in our Q, where the impact to our gross margin rate year to date is about 2.2 points and Q3 was 2.4. So, still strong but we are still seeing price erosion. But, again, the strength we're seeing this quarter mostly came from just improvements in productivity. Okay. I'll start. And make sure I don't forget the rest of the pieces, here, Chuck. You've got me covered there. Of our massively scalable data center customers, of that amount more than half of it is certainly switching, and then the next biggest follower is routing. So, it's more than 50%, significantly more than 50% is our switching products. To your point on then, you inferred -- what does it mean that switching overall was down 3%. I just want to reiterate. Let me just clarify the question. He believes that we rolled the web-scale into our enterprise business. So, he was saying we were negative 2% on enterprise. Definitely in our service provider segment. In our service provider segment, Pierre. Now you can answer that question. Sorry about that, Pierre. These web-scale customers are definitely in our service provider segment, which was flat overall for the quarter from a bookings perspective. On the rest of the portfolio, to your question on service provider, we're seeing, again, the slowdown from just the overall service provider CapEx spend. And you're seeing that reflected certainly on our routing portfolio. Just a couple comments. I don't think we have ever exposed that over half of that business is coming from switching. So, clearly there is value in our switching portfolios that the web-scale players are seeing. I also think that there is still a small percentage of the overall SP business as it relates, which is you'll see flat when the segment was up 31% given the size of the business. But obviously, you could have done that math. But I do think that our teams have done a really good job here. Kelly, the other question, the third portion of the question, was that relative to any revenue impact in Q4 that we have built into the guidance relative to the macro environment, just generically we are not modeling any improvement, I think is the safest way to say it. We do see continued amount of uncertainty out there and we're not modeling any improvement into Q4. Thanks for the question, Brent. Let me, first of all, say that I think over the last few quarters Joe Cozzolino and his team have been incredibly focussed on driving the operational excellence around the P&L element of that, which is what you have seen with the gross margins, and I think some of the discussion I had earlier around the focus on the renewal capability. I think we're seeing general improvement in the execution there. We see advance services obviously doing reasonably well; security services doing reasonably well. And then, as I mentioned earlier, the renewal activity, our teams did a better job this past quarter. So, I think a lot of what you're seeing is operational discipline and execution, to be honest. However, I think that there is an opportunity, and more of our customers are asking us to help them, as they look at their strategies to take advantage of this digital transition that's occurring. I'm not sure that I'm in a position where I would give you any tangible connection between it and future product growth, but we definitely see that as a required service that we're going to need to provide to our customers because they're looking to us as one of the few large, capable, financially viable partners that really understand this transition. Thanks, Mark. I'll let Kelly tackle the second question. If you look at what we declared and we stated our strategy is around cloud, it really is focused on enabling what we believe is going to be the long-term desire of our customers, which is to operate in a hybrid cloud model. And we said that we're going to do three primary things. We're going to make sure that we provide the infrastructure to the cloud providers. And we've done that with SPs and we've done that, obviously, with the top 10 web-scale providers, given the business was up 31%. We also said that we were going to transition our portfolio to be cloud-delivered and as a service, delivered where it makes sense, and over time across the entire portfolio. And you've seen us do that with our continued growth in Meraki in collaboration and security. And now the plans are actually under way on a project to deploy that across the rest of our portfolio, although it's early days. I think when you look at deferred revenue of 36% on the balance sheet, that says that we're being successful in that second pillar. And then the third pillar was to help our customers with the infrastructure needed to actually take advantage of both private and public clouds or enabling hybrid. And when you look at the data center switching portfolio on an annualized $4 billion business, with new orders growing in double digits, I think that customers are driving both. And I think that the three pillars of that strategy are working. As far as gross margins when we sell to private cloud versus public cloud, Kelly, can you comment there? Yes. I'd say we obviously have different margin profiles within both. But I'll say both, whether it's campus versus data center, or whether it's to the service providers versus enterprises, both margin profiles are well above the Cisco average gross margin rates. And between campus and the data center side, we're within 5 to 6 points of gross margin. So, the differentiation is not much there. We can have variations within that. We have some public cloud customers on some deals that might have better or worse margins. But overall, the portfolio is within those ranges, and again, way accretive to the overall Cisco margins. I'll take the first one. On the first one, yes, we were being rounding. It's actually closer to a $2.2 billion run rate, so sequentially I'm certainly up sequentially than what I was last quarter. Yes, I think when we hit it last quarter it was probably roughly $2 billion. This time it is closer to $2.2 billion, $2.25 billion on the ACI portfolio. And then on the acquisition front, what I would say is that, given the valuations and given the movement in the tech industry, that we'll continue to be opportunistic. We're in a good position as a strategic buyer with some of the challenges in the public market and some of the valuations becoming a little more realistic. What I suggest to you, that over the next 12 months we'll be quite as active as we have been in the last 12. I probably wouldn't expect it to be quite as fast-paced as it has been but we will continue to be opportunistic around the areas of growth that are important to our future. 15% of our overall total revenue? Or 15% of our service provider revenue? Paul, we haven't been disclosing that. We just don't disclose that. Again, Paul, it is not something we give out. I apologize. But it is not. Yes, I would say, it was -- it wasn't that crazy. Obviously our extra week, when it actually fell in from a calendar perspective, was in February. But, again, because the way the teams were forecasting, I would say the linearity in terms of what we see usually coming through month three was in the normal ranges. It's a good question, Tal. I'm just having a better week this week. No, I'm kidding. I think the difference is, if you go back to when we ended our last quarter it was towards the end of January. And if you recall, the last few weeks of that quarter were the weeks when the stock markets were having those incredibly wild swings, and our customers actually put the brakes on pretty significantly. So, coming into that earnings call, we had seen a very tough close to the quarter from an orders perspective. We saw our enterprise customers, in particular, really put the brakes on because they were just completely unsure of what was going to transpire. And I think that led us to a very cautious tone. So, that would be the number one reason why we were more cautious then. I just want to make sure that we are balanced here, that while we're optimistic and we're pleased with our execution, we still are operating in a relatively uncertain environment. We got the Brexit coming up, the vote coming up in June. We've got the news out of the Fed today. We've got all the election dynamics. We got issues in Brazil, we've got geopolitical dynamics. So there is a relatively broad set of unknown issues out there. So, we're still operating in an uncertain environment. But I think the stock market issue and the timing of the end of our last quarter would probably be the biggest difference. Yes, Simon, it's a good question. I think that there's a misconception about what's driving this belief that all the customers want to buy white box switching. And I think this is in the same vein of -- it is all about cloud, or all about SDN, or all about white box. None of these customers are fundamentally chasing a technology trend. There are underlying business drivers that are leading them to these solutions. So, what we've been doing is focusing on attacking the business driver and not so much the technology trend that everybody writes about. In the case of the web-scale players, what they're looking at is, they're looking for significant automation. They're looking for the ability to run massive data centers at huge scale, very low cost, with a ton of automation, which over time will become the norm, I think, for all customers. There is this massive focus on operational expense reduction, which is all around automation, programmability, which is where we are headed with our core platforms in the enterprise, as well. So, what we did is we built some really aggressive products. Our teams, again the ASICs improvements that have been built that give us the advantage on the price performance, and then enabling our portfolio to fit within the operational environments of these customers, I think, has been the key. That's where what they're looking for. They're not singularly focused on white box. They're looking at how do they solve that problem. And we're just spending more time with them to really understand what they need and how we can fit their requirements. And you're going to see us continue to evolve our portfolio in whatever way we need to, to make sure that we remain relevant there. Brian, it is a great question. I actually didn't expect anyone to highlight the fact that our China was decelerating, as our third quarter of really solid growth in China. I will point out that, that is across the board, it is across the portfolio. The team has done an amazing job there. I've spent a fair amount of time over there and I think that we're really pleased with where we are in China right now, in the midst of the uncertainty that's being discussed in the marketplace. On the Inspur partnership, in September we signed the MOU, which was basically a letter of intent to formulate the venture. I was over there three weeks ago where we formalized the term sheet basically, and we're in the final stages of getting that one put together. I would expect that we'll be in market sometime in the fall with some of the early products and solutions with them. We're spending a lot of time with them right now. So I think late this year is when we'll begin to see some early results from that. I think on the Ericsson front, any time you do these really large partnerships, they always take a little longer probably than we would all hope, but we're very optimistic. We've spent a ton of time together. I think on the last call we talked about the number of joint solutions within the first 100 days that we actually had on display together at Mobile World Congress, which was pretty amazing. And then this past quarter we saw 17 transactions close between our teams, in the midst of a time where Hans is doing a pretty significant organizational restructuring and our teams are getting to know each other. We'd all want it to go faster but we're pretty pleased where that partnership is right now. Thanks, Marilyn. First of all, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today and I want to thank you for your questions. I would just go back to the three things that I stated earlier. I'm really proud of what we've done. I'm proud of the way the teams have executed. It is a challenging environment out there and I think that our teams have proven that we continue to execute regardless of the environment we face. As I said last call, we're running the Company on two fronts. We're focused on the execution and operational excellence, and at the same time we're focused on transitioning our business and investing in the future, which I think was displayed by our progress in the different areas that I highlighted during the call today. I think that, again, if you look at our success in security and collaboration, next-gen data center, the Meraki cloud networking platform, and overall in our transition to software and subscription; I think we're on that journey. We have proven that we can transition elements of our portfolio and we're going to apply that same approach again to the rest of our business. We're in the early days on the front end of a long journey, but I'm pleased with where we are. I want to thank all of you for spending time with us today and we'll look forward to talking to you soon. Marilyn?","Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify your guidance for the July quarter. How much of the revenues embedded in that guidance comes from acquisitions that closed in the last year, just so we can get a sense for the organic trends in the business. And then when we think about the 3% growth in bookings in the quarter, how much of that was benefited by the extra week in the quarter? Thanks, and congrats on great execution. First question is with regards to the data center. I hear your comments with regards to the macro impact on it, but it's five quarters in a row now where that business is stuck between the $800 million to $850 million in revenue. And this business has accounted for about one-third of your growth in the past few years. So, if you can us a little bit more color as to why isn't this moving, that would be great. The second question with regards to the gross margins, I have to go back all the way to 2010 to find product gross margins that are equal to those that you just reported. Can you just give us a little bit more maybe of a framework to think about what is really changing in the portfolio, whether it be through mix or change in the competitive environment, anything that can justify the increase in gross margins and how sustainable you think that is. Yes, hi, thanks. Hi, Chuck, hi, Kelly. You did clearly better than feared results. Congratulations to you and your team. My question is as follows. This is Chuck. Heading into the back half, what gets you most excited in terms of new product refresh opportunities? And then, now that your security business honestly is starting to turn the corner, especially versus the peer plays, would you double down on security investments both organically and [a money]? Thanks. Your switching and routing businesses were both down. How concerned are you about that? Do you think your new product portfolio is yet to impact that? Do you believe your losing share or it's the markets? And then, finally, what is the impact on your services businesses, in other words, how much of that is maintenance that could be impacted by declining hardware? Thank you. And congratulations, Chuck and Kelly, to your team there at Cisco. One thing that stood out was the very impressive gross margins this quarter. If I calculated it correctly, it looked like it was around 65.2%. And that was meaningfully above -- I think your guidance was 62.5% to 63.5%. Can you help us to understand what were the factors to drive it higher? I know the guidance all included an extra week. And then for the outlook, are there any type of swing factors we should be aware of and the causes of why it will be lower than the reported gross margins just from this quarter? And, again, congratulations to you and your team. Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to come back on what you said about your stuff in hyperscale, web-scale clients. If I get that correctly you had revenues up 31% there. Could you give us a sense of what made most of this revenue and most of these growth? Was that mostly switching, routing, anything else? And then if we exclude that very strong performance on that segment, what did the rest of enterprise look like in terms of, so you were down 2% over all? I assume that is web-scale at 31%. Probably the rest is enterprise, was down quite significantly. And, lastly, could you help us quantify any of the macro impact? You mentioned about enterprise in this quarter and in your guide for next quarter, I don't know -- maybe in points of revenues or whatever, do you have a sense of how much you've lost because of the uncertain macro environment? Thanks a lot. Thank you for taking the question. Chuck, I wanted to follow up on services revenue. I get there was a clear benefit of an extra week but this now marks, I think, the second quarter in a row of upside coming from the services segment. I imagine most of the return of double-digit growth was the extra week. My question is, are you seeing a broader increase in services driven by digitization or solutions selling trends? And if so, do you expect the services recovery to potentially be a leading indicator for a future product recovery? Yes, thanks, good afternoon. I just want to see if we can talk a little more about the cloud. You talked about the ACI momentum. How should we think about the mix of just cloud revenue for Cisco in terms of how much is going into public cloud versus private cloud as the run rate improves? And then is there any change in terms of public cloud versus private cloud related to margin, either from a gross margin perspective or operating margin perspective that we should be aware of? Thank you. Great, thank you very much. I just had a clarification. You talked about ACI hitting about $2 billion annualized run rate. And I think our notes have suggested it was at a similar level the last couple of quarters, at least you gave a similar level. I just want to make sure our notes are right there. And then, really, my question is around acquisitions. You guys clearly have been quite active doing acquisitions and doing a lot of what looked to be pretty promising technology related acquisitions. Should we expect the current pace to persist or are we going through an accelerated period that you think that we're pretty close to slowing down from? Thanks. Thanks very much. Chuck, going back to the question about the top 10 web 2.0, I don't think you have ever broken it out, at least in my memory. But if routing is 15% of your total revenue, and service provider typically, if I remember the numbers correctly, are 80% of routing. That would suggest that the web 2.0 guys are somewhere in the range of 15% of total revenue, if I'm looking at the current numbers correctly. Is that in the ballpark? I'm basing it off of -- if routing is 15% of total and service provider is 80% of routing again, that would suggest that traditional service providers, being the bulk of your routing revenue, are somewhere in the order of 12% of total revenue. I recognize it by more than just routing. If I saw the service category correctly in terms of 30% of total bookings -- maybe I misread the number -- that would suggest the web 2.0 guys -- let me just ask the question directly. Can you give us any sense for how large the web 2.0 category is? In that 15% range? Let me ask you a simple question, and I think you mentioned it before. But can you give us any insight of the linearity of the quarter? Hopefully you can hear me. I have just one clarification. The tone of the previous conference call was very different. It was about the very weak environment and we didn't speak about the growth trends. The tone of this conference call is so much more positive in a very similar business environment. So, what happened in the last three months that makes you so much more positive about -- everything you have done basically also before, very little is new now -- what makes you so much more positive now versus three months ago in a similar environment? Or unless maybe the environment has gotten better. Great. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the web-scale vertical a bit. I know that is beating a dead horse a little on this call. But I wanted to see if you could talk about the bigger trend around the white box competitive threat, because it seems apparent that there is not the dramatic shift to white box that many had feared. But maybe it has yet to happen. So if you could talk how you're countering the threat or the substitution effect of those web-scale customers building or buying unbranded switches, rather than your products. Thank you. I'm wondering if you could walk us through what you've seen so far with the Inspur relationship in China. I see China revenue decelerated but it still grew very strongly at 22%. And also the Ericsson relationship -- it sounds like you've got some big deals in the quarter, or a few deals in the quarter. Maybe just highlight if you feel like that relationship is still on track for this $1 billion by 2018. The reason I ask, obviously Ericsson had a very soft March quarter. Thank you. All right, Chuck, I think that was our last question. Why don't I go ahead and turn it over to you to close it out. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY16 fourth-quarter and annual results, will be on Wednesday, August 17, 2016, at 1.30 PM Pacific time, 4.30 PM eastern time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department. We thank you very much for joining the call today.

CSCO,Q1 2017,2214,3482,1827,"Thanks, Sam. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first-quarter FY17 quarterly conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding Webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on a financial information section of our Investor Relations website. As is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to our prior-period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. The reclassified amounts have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparison throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated other wise. The matters we will be discussing include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of FY17. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder in Q2 FY16, on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devises business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 FY17. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. With that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn. We delivered a strong Q1 in an environment that continues to be challenging. We executed very well in the quarter, with revenue growing 1% and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 3%, along with continued strength in non-GAAP gross and operating margins. This quarter total product orders declined 2%, largely due to Service Provider orders declining 12%, which was worse than our expectations heading into the quarter. We continued to show great product in how we are aligning our business model to the way our customers want to consume Cisco technology. There are many strong indicators that we are driving this change, including the 48% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions. At the same time, we are delivering more innovation with simple, intelligent automated solutions with industry-leading security across our portfolio. Let me review a few areas of our business where our innovation is driving momentum. First, security. Our security revenue grew 11%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We're driving more subscription-based recurring business, resulting in deferred revenue growth of 39%. Our competitive position in security is growing stronger, as our integrated architecture approach and best-of-breed portfolio resonates with our customers. In fact, we're the only company with security product revenue exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate with double-digit growth. I'm incredibly pleased with how the team has transformed this business from where we were just a few years ago, establishing Cisco as the market leader in the most critical priority area for our customers. This past quarter, we again drove rapid adoption of our advanced threat solutions, with AMP revenue growing over 70% and now deployed at over 22,000 customers globally. We also see ongoing traction with our next-generation firewall revenue growing over 35%, as we added 5,300 customers in Q1 bringing our total next-gen firewall customer base to approximately 62,000. Going forward, we are driving innovation, as we extend our security architecture from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Over two weeks ago at our partner summit, we launched our enhanced AMP for Endpoints, a SaaS-based cloud managed security solution combining prevention, detection and response capabilities delivering simplified and effective endpoint security through our threat-centric architecture. Second, our next-generation data center, our goal is to build the best private and hybrid cloud solutions for our customers. We are investing heavily in our data center portfolio to extend our market leadership. To do this, we are delivering software, hardware and systems at all levels of the data center stack and across delivery models. Our customers' widespread adoption of Cisco's ACI family of data center networking products continued in Q1, with revenue growth of 33% to an annualized revenue run rate now of $3 billion. The automation of data center networks that ACI delivers is the first step in enabling our customers to move work loads in and out of public cloud environments, while maintaining enterprise security and policy. We are building on the foundation of ACI by extending our capabilities with analytics through tetration, agnostic cloud management with cloud center from our CliQr  acquisition and our hyper converge offering, HyperFlex. This will give our customers flexibility, agility and savings by delivering the benefits of both private and public clouds. We have a unique set of capabilities to lead in this market and address our customers needs for delivering business applications quickly, cost effectively and at scale. In collaboration, we are adding new capabilities to our collaboration and IOT offerings through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships. As a global market leader, Cisco's collaboration business has a solid foundation to drive our road map of products and services that will increasingly be delivered from the cloud such as Spark, our end-to-end business collaboration suite. Over the last few months, we've added two significant partners to our collaboration ecosystem. We announced a global strategic alliance with Salesforce to natively integrate Cisco's cloud collaboration platform with Salesforce's Lightning platform. This will deliver expanded reach and relevance as part of our cloud strategy. We also formed an alliance with IBM to further enhance the collaboration experience for our customers by combining our collaboration and analytics technologies. We are integrating our Cisco Spark and WebEx offerings with IBM's cloud collaboration solutions, along with cognitive computing capabilities enabled by the IBM Watson platform. While the dynamics in service provider and emerging markets continue to present headwinds to overall growth, I'm pleased with our success in accelerating our momentum in our key investment areas and our commitment to operational discipline. Now let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q1 results and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. On driving profitable growth, total revenue grew 1%, while our non-GAAP EPS was up 3%. We expanded our profitability year over year, with increases in both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margins. Let me provide some details on revenue. Total product revenue was down 1%. We saw switching decline 7%, driven by weakness in campus, partially offset by continued strong momentum in ACI, which was up 33%, as Chuck mentioned. In campus, we still see a pause in enterprise spend, largely driven by uncertainty in the macro environment. Routing grew 6%, driven by growth in both SPCORE and Edge. Collaboration was down 3%, although we did have solid order growth. The revenue decrease was driven by telepresence and unified communications endpoints, partially offset by strong growth of 10% in conferencing as we see more customers each quarter committing to WebEx. We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions and SaaS offers with deferred revenue up 14%. Data center declined 3%, impacted by the market shift we've seen from Blade to Rack. While not significant in terms of revenue at this point, we did see our new hyper converged offering, HyperFlex, as solid early uptake by our customers. Wireless declined 2%, lead by a decline in controllers and soft e-rate funding, partially offset by strong growth in Meraki with our cloud managed product line. Security grew 11%, with deferred revenue growth of 39% as we transition to more software and recurring revenue. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security, up 100% as well as web security solutions, which was up 60%. Services grew 7% with our ongoing focus on renewals and attach rates. Overall, we're making progress each quarter on our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 12%, with product up 19% and services up 8%. The portion of our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 48% to $3.8 billion. From an orders perspective, total product orders declined 2%, with book-to-bill below one. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was down 4%, EMEA grew 1%, and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 2%, with the BRICs plus Mexico up 2%. In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 5%, commercial grew 1%, public sector was flat, and service provider declined 12%. We are driving consistent profitability. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 65.2%, growing 0.3 points, with product gross margin of 64.8%, up 0.3 points and service gross margin flat at 66.2%. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.6%, improving 0.2 points. We remain disciplined and focused on increasing operational efficiencies and productivity. In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61, up 3%. GAAP EPS was $0.46. Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments, we completed three acquisitions in Q1, increasing our investments in key priority and growth areas including CloudLock, which specializes in cloud access security broker technology, which is part of our security business, ContainerX that develops enterprise-class container management technology and Worklife, which develops meeting software that is complimentary to our collaboration business. Moving on to shareholder value, in Q1 we delivered operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q1 were $71 billion, with $10.4 billion available in the US. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well in Q1 delivering, strong profitable growth. We also made solid progress on our transition to more software and subscription based models. We're committed to making the key strategic moves and disciplined investments to drive long-term financial performance and deliver shareholder value. Now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of FY17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the second quarter of FY17 is as follows. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus-2% to minus-4% year over year, normalize to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q2 FY16. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64% and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57. I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call. Thanks, Kelly. I'm very pleased with the success of the investments we've made in priority growth areas such as security, collaboration and our ACI platform. These areas are key building blocks, along with our strong franchise and switching and routing, that place Cisco in a unique position with our customers as they become increasingly digital. As you've seen with our Meraki platform, we've achieved rapid adoption of cloud managed networking, with enterprise security and policy delivered as a service. Over the next several years, we will bring this automation, management and security at scale to the balance of our switching and routing portfolio as we continue to offer new consumption models aligned to our customers' needs. While this is no small task, it's an incredible opportunity for Cisco as we bring this successful model to the largest part of our business. As we make these investments we also remain firmly committed to operational discipline and driving long-term value for our customers and shareholders and I'm very optimistic about our future. Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions. Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. While Sam is doing that, I would like to remind the audience we ask you to please ask one question.","Hey, Ittai, thanks for the question. Let me hit a few of those areas. Let me first just acknowledge that there are always areas we can execute more effectively. We are working right now, the teams have been working over the last year on innovation in many of the areas you mentioned and again, I'm optimistic about the pipeline of innovation we have right now. I think when you look at the switching portfolio for us, back in January, when we saw the real market declines at that time and we called out the first pause we saw in the enterprise campus refresh, it's just basically maintained. It stayed the same way throughout the year. I'm pretty comfortable with our position there and as we continue to work on bringing automation and security and cloud-based management to the rest of the portfolio, I think that, that will help our customers see the opportunity to refresh. For me, it's really about as we look at the key driver of refresh over the longer term in the campus, I think that it's going to be really around automation, which can substantially reduce the operating expenses for our customers, as well as security into the network and analytics out of the network. In a couple other areas you mentioned, I think in UCS there's been a fundamental shift in the data center to, again, we've talked about the rack technology and in hyper converge we have some early success with HyperFlex and we have some new capabilities that will be coming out after the first of the calendar year that I think will help us in that space. On the wireless front, there are really, I think there are two key drivers there. First of all is the market is transitioning to a controller-less architecture, so in large part, our access points were actually positive but the controller side of that business was down, Meraki was positive, and then also we are a pretty substantial recipient to the e-rate business, so as that has moved out much more slowly than expected, I think that, that has also impacted that business. Hopefully that gives you some color around those areas. Thanks, Vijay. I think if you just look at our guidance, let me be clear. It's predominantly the SP weakness and the overall CapEx challenges that we've seen in SP. That business is large account driven. You can assume that we have done an account by account by account analysis in that space and understand what's going on there. Right now I think there are a unique set of characteristics, particularly in the SP space. You have the overarching macro uncertainty in the economy, which I think has lead to the SP CapEx weakness that's been reported all year by the analysts, as well as you have political and regulatory environments that are somewhat uncertain, both in the US and around the world. Some of those could turn more favorable. Some of those could remain negative. We're just not going to model any improvement there and that's the real reason for the guide, just to be clear on that. Post election, I think that most CEOs that I talk to, we are pragmatic about the result and now we are all focused on the policy issues that matter to each of our companies. We're -- I think that President-elect Trump appears to be very business oriented and is very focused on driving the US economy and any time the US economy improves, that's certainly good for us. Kelly, any comments? No, I agree. To address where we're investing the most, because no matter what the economy we're going to be investing for the future. I'd say it's in the same areas we have been. We are continuing to invest heavily in security. We think there's a lot of room to run there. I think we're benefiting and you're seeing us benefit from having not only a best-of-breed portfolio but an integrated solution that ultimately we do think once CIOs start spending again we'll see also drive some of the campus, hopefully. For sure security, data centers a focus for us and Chuck mentioned some of the innovation we have with the data center but also with the analytics around that. Then even in the core we're investing. Chuck talked about how we're driving automation and things along those lines. We're putting heavily our investment there as we drive innovation that you'll see today as well as going forward the next few quarters. Thanks, Pierre. I appreciate the question. Yes, we are very happy with the progress we are making on it and you can see it on the balance sheet, to your point. We are up sequentially as well as over $1 billion, $1.2 billion year over year. I'd say it's a couple points for sure impact on our growth and it's a combination of -- its largely been historically collaboration and security and Meraki, but we are continuing to add on our core platform with our Cisco ONE suite, like I mentioned last quarter, which that is now being recognized ratable where a year ago, we would have recognized that as a perpetual license sale. For example, just using Cisco ONE as an example in this quarter, it would have been a point and a half just on that if we had recognized it perpetually like we had a year ago. It's for sure about at least two points and clearly that continues to grow and accelerate, so you can assume we're assuming that in my guidance. My guidance for the next quarter is as Chuck mentioned, right? We definitely saw the same thing we saw last quarter with the slowdown in SP, but it actually accelerated. I wouldn't call my guidance conservative. I'd say it's absolutely what we see right now based on all of the factors we take into account. Thanks, Simona. I'll let Kelly keep me honest on this, but I think our routing revenue that we reported in Q1 was 6% positive, so if that's incorrect we need to fix that. On the guide, what I believe is that the predominant reason for the guide down is this Service Provider space. It's 25% of our business, roughly, and it was down 12% in new orders. You guys know the content of our revenue that is from current quarter bookings so the forecast this past quarter and the performance was negative 12% and we're just not modeling, right now, any improvement. You've written some great stuff around the SP CapEx environment, so I think you know it as well as anyone. While there is some forward-looking optimism, many of those cases there's money being spent on density and mobile networks in areas that we may not be a direct recipient as well as we also know there's a lot of variability in how the actuals actually play out vis-a-vis the forecast. We're just making sure that we really see that. I think there's also consternation around the world relative to what's going to happen in the political environment and just a little bit of a wait and see and I think that's going to have an impact. Could be positive, could be tough based on the SP CapEx, but most of the guide challenge that we have is related to SP. Kelly, anything to add? I think you summarized it well. Just to add to your question, Simona, I'm not going to go into the grungy detail of what else is in there besides SP core and routing, but obviously our enterprise routing business is in there, mobile packet core, those kind of areas that we saw that are included in the revenue. To Chuck's point, the routing business is certainly got a lot of big deals driven and the pressure we see from the orders, you can expect to see coming in the future, as Chuck mentioned. One other comment or two. When I talk about customers that we saw just fundamentally freeze CapEx, some of those did it for their own earnings requirements. Some of it did it -- we have examples that occurred based on currency challenges, FX issues. We saw some that were connected to consolidation that's going on in the industry, so we saw different flavors but we did see a fair number of customers around the world that just put the brakes on. James, thanks. This is Chuck. As it relates to the first part of your question on the acquisition capabilities, I think what you'll find with this team is that there's a ton of internal innovation occurring. We, again, at the partner summit launched AMP for Endpoints, which is to bring the endpoints into the consolidated architecture. You can assume that we are actively continuing to scan the landscape relative to acquisitions that fit within the architecture, that bring new capabilities. I think when I took the role I would probably suggest that there was a little bit of a pent-up demand around companies that teams wanted to move on and we moved relatively quickly in the first year or so. I wouldn't assume that, that suggests that there's no more activity that we will see there. I think we will. As it relates to the core networking platforms and at what point we'll see security pulling through, I think we have had some examples over the last few years where we've seen particularly security portfolios integrated into routing platforms as the teams have done that we have seen as we sell those as licenses that run on top of routers. Assuming the routers have the right horsepower, they're fine. If they don't, then they'll drive a refresh. There's some capabilities the teams are work on that actually provide security at the packet level inside the network. Our intent over the next several quarters is to bring that technology to market and give our customers greater visibility and give them yet another source of contributing to the threat landscape out of the network itself. We'll have to wait and see how successful we are, but that's our plan. Well, Jim, thanks. I think there's not one answer to that question, honestly. As I said earlier, there's some customers that are looking at consolidation that lead them to take a pause. There's some that are focused on density of their mobile networks as opposed to their core routing platforms or the edge routing platforms. There's some that outside the United States who faced incredible currency headwinds and decided to stop their CapEx spend until they had better clarity around the currency situation. Then there's some providers around the world, not necessarily in the US even, that are dealing with political dynamics and potential regulatory issues that just aren't clear. I think it's a little bit of all of that and my assessment of when those issues are resolved is dependent upon the issues themselves and we're going to have to wait and see how they play out. I have not heard a lot, say, US-based service providers who have paused directly related to the election, but I do believe that the regulatory environment in the US is obviously in flux now around the telecom environment and that could have implications for the service providers and some of them may wait and see how that plays out. What we talked about the last couple quarters is just the top 10 that we have and they were roughly flat this quarter, but I'll tell you we had some performances that were incredibly strong within that, at an account level, and some that were pausing for various reasons. I think that each account is different and I think over the last couple of years what we've been talking about is a deep engagement at the individual customer level. Where we've done that, we had begun to see success. You can assume we are having discussions with each of them individually. We also are, I think, uniquely positioned where in many cases these companies are markets of one and we have the ability to assign dedicated engineering teams to line up our offerings against their specific requirements and those are the discussions we're having right now. Sure. I'll answer that one. The recurring revenue number I think is what you're talking about, which is a combination of our product recurring revenue from the software and SaaS business plus recurring revenue from services. This quarter that was 29% and we continue to make progress of product, that has grown to be 9%, up from 6% of our product revenue in Q1 2016, so we continue to make progress there. That's up to 29% versus it was 28% in Q4 and 25.5% in Q1, so making the progress there. On the pricing question, Paul, we're definitely in the same ranges that we normally have been. It's actually year over year slightly better than we were last quarter can, which is largely driven by the mix of what we saw. I'd say that it's in normal ranges, but how we're driving that internally is, of course, we're very disciplined around pricing like we've talked about but we empower our sales leaders and country leaders to -- we measure them on three things. We measure them on revenue growth, we measure them on operating margin growth and we measure them on driving market share. They are empowered to make tradeoffs between those and if they need to give more price to win the franchises they want to win, they will do that. The good news is they are again continuing to be very disciplined making those tradeoffs and the pricing is staying in the normal ranges. Thanks, Steve. I think that over the next year to two years that a lot of the complexity in building out private infrastructure and private clouds for our customers will be alleviated. The entire industry is going to focus on, much like we talked about, even in the networking systems of how we bring automation and operational relief to our customers and give them the ability to automate policy and security and manage all of these devises from their private cloud or from the cloud. I think that, that level of simplicity and those capabilities will improve. I think what we see is best represented by our ACI portfolio. When you look at our customers who are building out modern data center infrastructure, I think those are representative of the customers who believe that they are going to have a hybrid environment. That piece of business grew 33% and is up to $3 billion run rate. I think your observations are probably valid, particularly if you look at a lot of the open stack, early open stack implementations. I do think that customers are going to want to have that capability and I think we as an industry will continue to work on simplifying how that operational capability shows up within our customer base. Sure. I think this has been a multi-year thing that we have been driving. I'd say that we incent, like I mentioned, the leadership at the higher levels, at a margin level and then they have also controls at certain discount levels, so they can also manage that within their region. It is definitely part of the focus. We have tools that are set up that when a sales person puts a deal in, it's easy to see how that deal falls in from a margin perspective to help them make good deals, if you will, so the incentives haven't changed at all this year. I think that it's just the sales teams are incredibly disciplined around it. I'd say the whole Company understands the tradeoff of that. We are all focused on making the tradeoff so we can optimize and drive as much growth as we possibly can and go after every point of market share that we can but they also understand the power of the margins and that helps drive it. I'd say only the other thing to think about is with the acquisitions that we have been doing that have been largely software related, whether it's in security or cloud, those SaaS businesses certainly have very high margins that just help add to the mix. Again, as we continue to do that, you'll continue to see a positive bias on our margins. Just one comment, Mark. Kelly and I have worked with the teams and from a leadership team perspective, we have three measurements that they are held accountable for, revenue, margins and market share. That's how we just try to keep people focused on a healthy balance. This is not just -- this is at all levels of the organization. Our Head of Sales and our Head of Partner Sales, you know they are all part of this pricing council that we have that we try to be very agile of when we make pricing, either new product pricing or changes to product pricing, to take advantage of where any elasticity is. Yes. I think that's a great question. I'd say -- let's just talk about switching. I'd say for campus switching, which is 2/3, roughly, of our entire switching business, which is our biggest business unit, I'd say most of that is macro, right? It is the one area, and I think we've talked about before. It's the one area that people can put off doing a refresh if there is any macro concerns. That's what we typically see any time you see any economic pause or macro event. I do truly feel that if the optimism we've seen this week in the stock market continues giving that feeling of optimism in the economy, I would expect that to raise all boats in our campus switching side. I'd say on the data center, you understand the dynamic there, right? To your point, we launched a fantastic product a couple years ago but we had to manage through the transition of a very sizeable legacy business data center portfolio declining as that accelerated and so we managed through that. Again, that business has continued to grow as we go through that intersection and cross through now as the legacy piece we've worked largely through. I'd say that's why I say it's largely macro, especially on the campus side. Yes, we can, Jeff. Jeff, so great question. I love balance sheet questions, actually. Yes, I mean again, we have talked about tax reform for a very long time. I can say that what's encouraging is with the incoming administration is this is one of their top priorities that they said they would prioritize in their first hundred days, so we're encouraged that something will happen. Now, it's very early and we don't really know the details besides what his platform was during his campaign, so we're going to watch it very closely and look forward to as the details flush out there. Just high level, as you could imagine, we have many, many scenarios of what we would do when repatriation comes, which is a combination of obviously we would ring fence in our debt and then we would have a blend of actions we can certainly take with our dividend as well as our share buyback, as well as leading flexibility for us to be able to do M&A and strategic investments. It'd be a combination of all those things. Obviously we listen very closely to our shareholders and how we want to do that and we recognize it will certainly give us a lot more flexibility. I'm sorry, I apologize. On the interest rates, would it affect our dividend policy? Again, we've been committed to growing our dividend with our earnings and again driving that to a great yield as our EPS grows. Interest rates go up, they go down. We're committed to growing it as our earnings grow. Thanks Marilyn. In summary, once again, we delivered a strong quarter in an environment that obviously continues to be challenging. I'm very pleased with the success that we've seen in security, collab, ACI, our deferred product revenue from software and subscription and we remain focused on executing against the things that we control. To that extent, I think the teams have done a very good job. We're obviously focused now on continuing to execute in those areas as well as, as I talked about earlier, bringing automation management and security at scale to the balance of our switching and routing portfolio and aligning with our customers' desires and how they consume our technology. Finally, we'll obviously remain very committed to operational discipline and long-term value for our customers and our shareholders. We thank you all for spending time with us today. Marilyn, I'll kick it back to you.","Chuck, I want to talk a little bit about the product mix between the divisions. The switching results are very disappointing. Clearly the wireless is now declining. Data center, and I have been asking you about data center for three quarters in a row and it's still not delivering and you've had changes in the leadership over there as well, which suggests still not where it needs to be. I guess I'm trying to gauge how much of the challenges that you are seeing here right now, in your opinion, are macro driven versus perhaps portfolio driven, because it seemed like a lot of competitors in some of these areas are actually doing very well in switching, for example, and (inaudible) and wireless, HP, even in the data centers doing well, (inaudible) clearly doing well. These are key major areas for you and we're seeing revenue decline. Help us understand kind of a little bit of what's going on under the surface here and what is it that makes you feel comfortable that there's no big problem. On the flip side, is there anything on the portfolio side that you think could turn the tide here? Thanks, Chuck. Are you there? Oh, yes, I'm here. I'm sorry, I was talking to myself on mute. Yes, so once again, a replay. Hi, Chuck, Kelly. In some sense, the January quarter guide is a snapshot in time and it lags what CEOs, CIOs could be thinking latest in terms of their spending intentions for the New Year. My question for both of you is in your latest cause for business leaders, post elections in particular, has CEO/CIO sentiment here in the US in particular improved in your view? Where do you think would be focus areas of spending in the context of your portfolio? Kelly, internally in the Company, where would you invest the most in terms of the product roadmap? Thanks. Great, thanks, Kelly. Hi, Chuck, Kelly and Marilyn. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig a bit into your deferred product revenues this quarter that have increased I think by a bit more than $1 billion year on year and actually $700 million or so, almost $700 million sequentially. It's a very impressive performance. The question I have is how do I take that into account when I look at your overall product performance that you had (inaudible) revenues slightly down in the quarter, but I would assume that a lot of that is related to the transition towards your subscription business. Do you have an estimate as how much this transition has impacted your number this quarter? Then of course I have the same question for next quarter. Your guide is very conservative. How much of this transition is actually impacting your guide for Q2 as well? Thank you. Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to confirm, Chuck, that the reason for the guidance being a little weaker is entirely to do with the softness you described in Service Provider orders. Just to dig into that and understand that a little better, it looked like your routing business was I think you said up 7% in the prepared remarks, although I see it as up 17% in the numbers posted online. Regardless, it looks like routing was quite strong. What other products within that Service Provider vertical accounted for the weakness. When we look at the CapEx trends, they definitely have been weak year to date, but they are implied to improve quite a bit into year end, so just curious if you aren't seeing that. Thanks, Chuck. Next question please? Thank you very much. I wanted to ask just around the security business. Obviously, as been pointed out, is that it's developing pretty well, but I'm wondering two things. First, the pace of acquisitions, and specifically what looked to be tuck-in acquisitions, seemed to have slowed a little bit this quarter versus what it had been running. I'm just wondering if you're feeling like you've got the portfolio and the technology where you need it or should we expect to see acquisitions continue to run pretty high and that perhaps those reaccelerate. My second question is on security. I think, Kelly, you kind of alluded to this, but at what point do we start to see incremental benefit on some of the other businesses from security footprint? It seems like a lot of the value of security could be tied to new hardware and switching and networking, et cetera. Should we expect to see some incremental pull through or benefit to the more traditional hardware businesses and if so, when should we expect that? Thanks. Great, thanks very much. Chuck and Kelly, when you mentioned putting the brakes on for some of the demand, can you clarify a little bit? Was that mostly due to the uncertainty around the election or just more uncertainty global demand and now that the election is over, there's a political uncertainty about how the tax and policy changes, what happens, cause those brakes to last in your opinion? How long or when do the brakes come off? Thanks. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could update us on what the saw in the cloud vertical last quarter. You saw weakness there so I was curious if that bounced back, what products you're seeing success with, with this customer set and where you are in your process to drive share with these operators. Thanks. Thanks, Jess, for the question. Thanks. Kelly, a clarification and then a question. The question is what's the pricing environment look like? Has there been any change?  I was hoping, I don't know if you gave the number earlier, but if not, what was software as a percentage of total revenue? Can you remind us, I think it was 29% last quarter but if you could remind us what it was and what it was this quarter? Thank you very much. Chuck, we just wrapped up our tech conference and we had a panel on folks who helped companies move to the cloud. The general consensus was that private cloud implementations generally are not working in many companies that begin on a private cloud path, end up going down a public cloud path. Obviously there's still a lot of legacy and so forth, but if in fact private cloud is not going to do very well, you and others are very focused on that business and the risk is that on-prem pie is declining. Are you seeing something different and do you believe the on-prem business will grow for Cisco? Yes, thanks, good afternoon. Chuck and Kelly, I want to get a sense here if there's been any change tactically related to how the teams are incentivized around margin, just given the Company continues to outpace the guidance on the gross margin line. Is there something going on there tactically or is this all just because of mix due to the broader macro weaknesses? Thank you. Hi guys. I had some macro questions and I want to ask it in the context of switching. There's a very big gap between the next quarter guidance year-over-year growth rate and your long term growth rate. The question that I have is, what part of the difference is macro, so if the macro slightly improves can you get there? Or is there anything that you can do on the product side that will get you closer? I want to ask it in the context of switching given that you had a major overhaul or major upgrade to your switching in the last two years, but we haven't seen the growth rates improving that dramatically. What can you do and what is macro? Thank you very much. Can you hear me okay? Wonderful, thanks. I wanted to swift gears and talk about the balance sheet, if I could. Obviously, you and many other companies in tech space have been advocating for repatriation for a decade, a very long time. Could you help us understand or remind us where you would like to take that money, should you bring it back to the US? The second part of that question is there's some sentiment that investment, or I'm sorry, interest rates will start heading north again. Do you take that into account when considering your dividend policy? Thank you. Thanks. I believe that is our last question. I'll now turn it over to Chuck to wrap it up. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our FY17 second-quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 1.30 PM Pacific Time, 4.30 PM Eastern Time. I would like to remind the audience in light of regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations team. We thank you very much for joining the call today. Thank you.

CSCO,Q4 2017,3002,4111,1700,"Thanks, Mark. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise, and the full year revenue and non-GAAP comparisons have been normalized to exclude the divested SP Video CPE business from our historical results. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, it's only been 7 weeks since we last spoke at our Financial Analyst Day, and our overall outlook remains consistent with what we outlined at that time. In fiscal 2017, we continued to execute well against our vision of delivering customers a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business. We managed our business through a dynamic environment and, at the same time, delivered significant innovation to further accelerate the next phase of our transformation. In Q4, we generated revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $48 billion, and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.39. We drove strong margins and record operating cash flow for the year. Our results demonstrate solid execution against our strategic priorities, accelerating our pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network and delivering technology in the way our customers want to consume it. In June, we announced a new era of networking with the launch of the network intuitive. This is an example of the industry-leading innovation Cisco is providing to its customers. The network intuitive is a new intent-based network that creates a fully integrated, intuitive system that is designed to anticipate actions, stop security threats in their tracks and continue to evolve and learn over time. We're applying the latest technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, to operate and define the network. From a security standpoint, the new network enables our customers to detect threats in encrypted traffic with unprecedented accuracy using Cisco's Encrypted Traffic Analytics and intelligence from Cisco's Talos cyber intelligence unit. We have created the only network that is designed for security while maintaining privacy, solving a previously unsolvable problem. Our new Catalyst 9000 switches represent the foundation of our intent-based networking capabilities and provide highly differentiated advancements in security, programmability, performance and lower operating costs by innovating at the hardware and software layer. This offering is also a great example of how we're moving our core business to a recurring revenue model. Customer reception to this new innovation has been incredibly positive. As we've always said, transitions of this nature are multiyear, but during the first 4 weeks in the market, our pipeline and product orders are strong with over 200 customers having ordered the new Catalyst 9000, the heart of the network intuitive platform. Our software value proposition in this portfolio is also compelling as the large majority of our customers are adopting the most advanced subscription offer available. Building on this early success, we intend to further accelerate our leadership in intent-based networking through the combination of our expertise in network infrastructure, AppDynamics visibility into applications and Viptela's automation capabilities. I believe that, over the next several years, we will see continued increasing relevance of technology as customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises. The network has never been more critical to business success, and we're looking forward to helping our customers take advantage of the insights and intelligence that are only accessible through our highly differentiated platforms. In Q4, we also announced an extension of our strategic partnerships with Apple, IBM and Microsoft. We plan to deliver the first enterprise security application on Apple iOS, and we're integrating our comprehensive security portfolio with IBM's Cognitive Security operations platform. Additionally, we're collaborating with Microsoft in 2 important ways. First, we're implementing a software layer on our data center switches that gives Microsoft the flexibility to run their own operating system on our industry-leading hardware platforms in their Azure infrastructure. Second, we're collaborating together to enable businesses to build and host their IoT applications in Microsoft Azure while extending the power of those applications to the Edge via Cisco's leading fog computing solutions. Now let's review other key parts of our business, starting with Security. We believe we are well positioned as the #1 enterprise security vendor. With growing cyberattacks and the need for our customers to protect their business-critical data and applications, we are aggressively providing security everywhere: in the network, in the cloud and at the endpoint. We don't believe any other company can match our capabilities given the criticality of the network in our customers' security architecture. Our best-of-breed products and integrated security architecture, combining analytics and automation, are winning in the market. Our Security business delivered a solid quarter with double-digit orders and 49% deferred revenue growth. This caps off a year in which we delivered 9% revenue growth with more than $2 billion in revenue, making us the only company growing at this scale. Our leadership position in network security continues to expand, driven by our next-generation firewall portfolio with over 6,000 new customers added in the quarter, which is 3x our nearest competitor, bringing our total customer base to nearly 80,000. Customers continue to rapidly adopt our advanced threat portfolio. We delivered revenue growth of 9%, and we added over 7,600 new customers, bringing the total number of AMP customers to over 42,000. Building on our differentiated security innovations, we recently completed the acquisition of Observable Networks, which extends our Stealthwatch solution into the cloud with highly scalable behavior analytics and comprehensive visibility. This platform expands our security -- our cloud security capabilities by providing greater support and compliance for applications deployed in Amazon Web Services as well as Microsoft Azure environments. Additionally, to combat the 90% increase in cyber attacks against IoT devices over the last year, we launched IoT Threat Defense Solution, an extensible, scalable security architecture created to defend devices in connected health care, electric utilities and manufacturing industries. In the Data Center, we're helping our customers take full advantage of a multicloud world that has become the norm in managing their applications and hybrid cloud solutions. Our goal is to deliver the best multicloud platform built on an intelligent, intuitive network, enabling faster, automated and highly secure delivery of applications in the cloud. We believe Cisco is best positioned to do this as everything we do in the Data Center is in support of both modern and traditional applications, both on-premise and in the cloud. Cisco has led the industry over the past 4 years with ACI, combined with UCS, Tetration, CloudCenter and our security solutions. In Q4, we saw strong performance of our multicloud infrastructure portfolio combined with our cloud-based SaaS offerings, including WebEx and Meraki cloud networking. For example, ACI, our fastest-growing data center switching platform, had a record quarter with growth of 38%. We continue to see strong customer adoption, driven by our ability to accelerate data center application deployments across private to public clouds. HyperFlex, our hyperconverged offering, combined with CloudCenter, is gaining traction with customers, benefiting from simplicity and scalability to support their hybrid cloud strategy. You will see us continue to strengthen our partnerships with public cloud providers as they look to Cisco to help our joint customers manage workloads across their private and public clouds. Lastly, we're delivering the right consumption models to enable continuous value and innovation for our customers. Our strong momentum continued in Q4 with 50% growth to $5 billion in deferred product revenue related to software and subscriptions, which has doubled from 2 years ago. For the first time, over $1 billion or 11% of our product revenue, came from recurring offers, which grew 40% year-over-year. Overall, 31% of our total revenue was recurring, and revenue from subscriptions now represents 51% of our software revenue. Going forward, you should expect to see our software business benefit from the transition of our campus networking portfolio to a subscription model. To summarize, our Q4 and full fiscal year results reflect a strong year of progress. We see tremendous opportunity in intent-based capabilities across our portfolio, and we will continue to evolve our business to be the leading provider of highly secure, software-defined, automated and intent-based infrastructure. Our innovation is as strong as ever as we focus on accelerating our core networking, security, software and cloud-based businesses. While it will take time, I firmly believe our core business is better positioned for the long term as we realize the benefits from our next-generation intent-based networking portfolio. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year, followed by the Q1 outlook. This quarter played out generally as we expected, and as we indicated in our guidance in our last call, we executed well, drove solid profitability, strong cash flow, and we continued to deliver on our strategic growth priorities. Total revenue was $12.1 billion, down 4%. We continued to focus on driving margins and profitability with strong non-GAAP operating margin of 31.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down 3%, and operating cash flow was strong, growing 5% to $4 billion. For the full fiscal year, we had revenue of $48 billion, down 2%, with product down 3% and services up 3%. Non-GAAP operating margin was a record $15.2 billion, expanding to 31.6% of revenue, up 0.6 points. Non-GAAP EPS, also a record, was $2.39, up 1%. And we generated record operating cash flow of $13.9 billion, up 2%. Let me provide some more details on our Q4 revenue breakdown. Total product revenue was down 5%. Switching declined 9%, driven by weakness in campus, partially offset by growth in the ACI portfolio, which was up 38%. We saw good initial traction of our new intent-based networking portfolio of the Catalyst 9000 family of switches. Routing was down 9%, driven by weakness in enterprise access. We did see a spending pause related to our acquisition of Viptela that we will integrate into our SD-WAN portfolio. Collaboration was down 3% due primarily to a decline in Unified Communications endpoints, partially offset by continued growth in conferencing. Deferred revenue grew 4%. Combined with the unbilled deferred, the 2 were up 16%. Data Center declined 4% with the continued market shift from blade to rack. However, we did see solid traction of our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex. During the quarter, we launched our UCS M5 servers, bringing greater simplicity and performance for next-generation data-intensive workloads and applications. Wireless grew 5% with strong Meraki performance as well as the ramp of our 11ac Wave 2 portfolio. Security was up 3% with strong performance in unified threat, web security and advanced threat, offset by declines in our legacy firewall products.  We did see very strong order growth during the quarter. Deferred revenue grew 49% as we continued to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 1%, driven by growth in software and solution services, partially offset by a decline in hardware maintenance. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 12% in total with product up 23% and services up 6%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was up 50% to $5 billion. We continue to transform our business to delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q4, we generated 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of almost 4 points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions increased 18% and now represents over 50% of our software revenue. In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders were flat. Looking at our geographies. Americas was down 2%, EMEA was up 3%. And APJC grew 2%. Total emerging markets declined 2% with the BRICS plus Mexico also down 2%. In our customer segments, enterprise declined 1%, commercial grew 4%, public sector was up 2%, and service provider declined 7%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 was $4.8 billion, up 3% compared to the end of fiscal year '16. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 63.7%, down 0.9 points. Product gross margin was 61.9%, down 2 points, and service gross margin was 68.8%, growing 1.8 points. While our total gross margin was solid, our product gross margin is continuing to be negatively impacted by memory pricing, which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was strong at 31.5%. For the full fiscal year, on a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin was 64.3%, a decrease of 0.4 points with product gross margin down 0.9 points and service gross margin up 1.1 points. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.6%, up 0.6 points via our focus on driving cost improvements, operational efficiencies and productivity. In terms of the bottom line, our Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down 3%, while GAAP EPS was $0.48. For the full year, we had non-GAAP EPS of $2.39, up 1%, while GAAP EPS was $1.90. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $70.5 billion with $3 billion available in the U.S. Q4 operating cash flow increased a solid 5% to $4 billion with free cash flow of $3.8 billion, up 7%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow grew 2% to a record $13.9 billion with free cash flow of $12.9 billion, up 4%. We returned $9.2 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 71% of our free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually. To summarize, in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we executed well, and we're focused on driving operational efficiencies and profitability to drive strong cash flow, enabling us to make the strategic investments to build long-term shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year '18. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue in the range of minus 1% to minus 3% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61. Consistent with how we talked about our business at our Financial Analyst Conference, in fiscal 2018, we will be redefining and simplifying our product reporting categories to better align with our evolving business model. We will continue to primarily run and operate our business by the 3 geographic segments, and so this change will only impact how we report on our products. Starting in Q1 fiscal year '18, we will realign our reporting into 5 distinct categories: infrastructure platforms, applications, security, services and other. I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments. Thanks, Kelly, and thanks again to all of you for joining us today. As we've discussed many times in the past, we're working on a multiyear transition, and while I'm confident with our progress, it's clear there's more for us to do. In Q4, we made ongoing progress, generating 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers and growing 50% in deferred product revenue related to software and subscriptions to $5 billion. I'm optimistic about our future, the direction we're headed and how we're transforming Cisco for the future. We are well positioned to succeed in a cloud- and digital-ready world, where the network is one of the most strategic assets for our customers. Looking forward to fiscal '18, as I said earlier, you can expect us to do the following: execute against our strategy and invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth and enhance shareholder value; leverage the power of the network to maximize our opportunities and differentiation in existing and new markets; drive relentless focus on innovation, creating continuous customer value across every element of our portfolio; and drive the right consumption models for our customers and accelerate our shift towards more software and subscription revenue. Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions. Thanks, Chuck. Mark, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)","Ittai, I'm shocked you asked a Switching question. Kelly? I'll answer the easy one first. Okay, good. Well, I have an easy answer. Cisco ONE -- we have over 20,000 customers now with Cisco ONE. Okay. So Ittai, let me touch on the Switching situation. First of all, the results we saw this quarter were not a surprise to us. If you think about our guide last quarter, we anticipated this. And we also knew at the time that we're going to be making the announcement in June about the new platform. And so we anticipated these results. Now anytime we do a major platform announcement, particularly in Switching, there is a period of time where our customers pause because they want to understand what this means. So we did see a pause, and we actually anticipated it. But we saw great traction with the new platform. As I said earlier, just in the 4 weeks where we closed the quarter, we had 200 customers that embraced this new architecture and purchased the new Catalyst 9000 platform. And as I said in the opening comments, the great majority of them also opted for the advanced software subscription that goes on top of it. And we've had a lot of conversations over the last 2 years as to whether we could really drive a subscription business on our core switching platforms. And what we see is that, at least, early indications are that we can do that. So we talked about our Data Center business. The ACI portfolio, again, record quarter, growing 38%. And then if you look at what we launched in the campus, typically, what we see is -- these are 3-year cycles to transition these platforms. But this is also not a typical platform transition. This is not speeds and feeds only. We brought forward some incredible innovation in this platform. And if you think about not only the actual product itself but the solutions that we announced around automation, which really gets at the operating expenses that our customers are incurring to manage their infrastructure, you look at one of the key drivers of why customers moved to the cloud, it was because of the complexity and the cost of their private infrastructure. So the ability to go drive significant cost out for our customers while managing this stuff over the next few years, we think, is a huge difference from a normal transition. The other is the fact that we launched Encrypted Traffic Analytics, which is our ability to determine when there's malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it, and that's an innovation that only Cisco can actually deliver. And both of those pieces of technology are what are included in that advanced subscription, which is what tells us that the customers see tremendous value in that subscription. So normally, we see 3 years. It's very early. And we would like to believe that we can accelerate that based on the incremental innovation that's being delivered as part of the platform, Ittai, but we'll have to see how it goes over the next quarter or 2. It's Jim Suva here from Citi. Last quarter, I believe you gave a little bit of commentary of a bit of a pause in the federal government spending and also Europe. It appears -- is that still continuing yet? Has it taken a step up to improve or deteriorate a little bit? And how should we think about that? And does Europe have any impact from Brexit? Jim, thanks for the question. Since you asked, why don't I just quickly cover sort of all the headwinds that we talked about in Q3? I'll give you a quick update on all of them, including the 2 that you asked. First of all, we talked about Mexico last quarter, which is generally in the same state it was last quarter. We didn't see any significant change, and again, that's largely driven by service provider weakness due to regulatory transitions as well as geopolitical dynamics, NAFTA renegotiation, et cetera. Emerging countries were slightly better, but there's still just tremendous uncertainty and disparity between performance in those countries. And service provider is generally the same as it was last quarter. The 2 that you asked about, in particular, we did see some shifts. In U.S. federal, I would say, in Q3, we had a real lack of clarity around budgets. In early May, we began to see, obviously, the clarity with the continuing resolution. And the way that the dollars get released in federal, we're in like the fourth phase based on how they prioritize releasing those budget funds. So we saw some improvement, not where we'd like for it to be, but we saw some improvement, particularly late in the quarter. And obviously, in federal, we're going to be facing the same issue again in 90 days, at the end of September, as we try to get another budget resolution passed. But you can see, on a global public sector perspective, you saw our orders last quarter were at minus 4%. This quarter, they were at plus 2%, and that was clearly -- a big part of that was the improvement we saw in the U.S. federal business. On the U.K., if you go back to Q3, we talked about it being significantly down. And one of the primary drivers was the headwind created by currency. In Q4, what I'll tell you is that headwind from currency remained. It did not ease up. However, our teams did a really amazing job, and we saw significant improvement in our enterprise and commercial business in the U.K. And if you look at the overall performance in EMEAR, you can see that the strengthening in the U.K. for us actually helped achieve the result at the EMEAR level. I'll say one final thing. In U.K., while enterprise and commercial were -- we saw a good uptick, service provider remained about the same. Yes, Pierre, let me give you a little color on the revenue question and sort of the business conditions, and then I'll let Kelly talk about the Q1 guide as well as the margins. In general, I think if you just look at our order rates that we released today, we went from negative 4% last quarter to flat in Q4 -- I'm sorry, from Q3, negative 4% to flat in Q4. So clearly, we saw improvement there. I will tell you that across the customer segments, just so you have some visibility, I think we showed the high-level numbers. I'll give a little bit of a double-click. On the enterprise side, we didn't see a lot of variability around the world in the performance there. Commercial, every region around the world improved from Q3 to Q4. Public sector, every region improved from Q3 to Q4. In SP, we had weakness everywhere. So that's just sort of a little color on the orders that we saw in Q4. Kelly, you want to talk a little bit about the revenue guide and margins? Yes, sure. On the revenue guide, as you know, Pierre, we call it like we see it. And as Chuck mentioned, the bookings being much better in Q4 than Q3 certainly helped a lot. And I'll just mention that we are starting off with a strong backlog with our backlog being up 3%. And we have good momentum as we go in the quarter. So we feel good about the revenue call for Q1. As I talk about margins, yes, our margins for Q4 were in the range, but we definitely saw our product margins go down 2 points year-over-year. And it really comes down quite simply to 3 points. The one and the biggest impact, by far, has been the increase of memory pricing and DRAM, specifically, for the overall business. That accounts for more than half of the 2 point decline. The second point that's really impacting that is in overall productivity. Whenever you have large parts of the portfolio or my largest business unit down 9%, like Switching, which is also a very profitable business, it impacts your ability to get cost savings in that quarter. So that was the second biggest driver. And then we just had a third driver, but to a much lesser extent, was a slight uptick in pricing erosion. Yes, Steve. So first, all I'll say on the Security, this is -- I have zero concerns about the business. This is a revenue timing issue. Our orders were -- they were some of the strongest -- we saw some of the strongest order growth in the quarter as we've seen in the last 2 years. So it's simply a revenue timing issue. It's funny. If you go back to Q4 of '15, the first call I did, there was concern about our Security revenue at 4%, and at the time, our deferred software was growing 26%. And this time, we had 3% revenue, but our deferred software was growing 49%. So the strength in the business, I'm still comfortable with. Kelly, you need comment on that...? No, I think you said it well, and it's literally just timing. We expect an uptick come back there in the next quarter. Vijay, can you speak up a little bit? It's a bit hard to hear you. Vijay, speak up just a tad bit higher there. We still... Much better. Much better. Much better. Okay. So I'll answer the first part. And I think, Kelly, I have an instinctive answer on the second part, but you probably have the mathematical answer. So what we're -- first of all, I think that when you look back at what we announced, probably -- I think FAC was 7 weeks ago, so it must have been 8 weeks ago or 9 weeks ago when we announced the actual network intuitive. It was probably one of the most significant launches we've had in almost a decade. And what I would tell you is there's a lot of emotional momentum right now within the employee base, with our customers, with our partners, with our sales organization about the innovation. And specifically, your question, I think that what we always knew was that if -- when we attempted to introduce a subscription model on a Switching product, we knew that we had to bring innovation that was -- that had such a high return for our customers that they would not have a problem buying it in that model, and that's what we've seen. When you look at the automation platform that we're going to -- that we're delivering to our customers and we're going to continue to enhance over the next several years and you look at the security capability that, frankly, only Cisco with our understanding of the network and with our threat intelligence that we get from Talos and with our ability to build silicon that can actually make that happen, I think our customers are actually quite pleased with the innovation. And so far, we've seen a high correlation with that to the advanced subscription. So as far as the geographic issue, Kelly? Yes. I mean, the -- as far as the geographic, it's following very closely with our natural split. We definitely have more in the Americas, but we've a very healthy pipeline in Europe as well as APJC. So it's getting traction everywhere. Yes. Thanks, Tim. So we were together 7 weeks ago. The story here hasn't changed significantly. As I've said in the past, we have reengaged in a very big way. I will tell you that we've had some wins. We actually had the press release that I talked about in my earlier comments with Microsoft about running their OS on our cloud silicon switches. And we continue to make traction with these customers. As I've said, we're looking at each of them very individually as to what it is they need. And we're also looking at broad-based partnerships with them, not only for their own infrastructure but as they realize that the importance of having this multicloud capability and the ability to run not only applications in a central public cloud but be able to run portions of those applications out of the edge of the network is leading to a very complementary partnership that we're talking about with all of them. So I would say that not a lot's changed in the last 7 weeks, but we're still continuing to make solid progress, and I'm optimistic. All right. So on the memory, yes, we've talked about memory for the last 3 quarters. We started to see this as a headwind initially in Q2, and it's just gotten progressively worse. I think it's very much public information that the prices continue to climb. And in this scarce supply environment, our supply chain team has done a great job securing supply for us, but those prices continue to be at market -- at prices as it goes forward. So it's continuing to be a moving target. And again, as I will say to the guide, our gross margin ended up in the range of our guide. So those are just some of the variables as we go forward. As I look forward, I think we expect the memory pressure to continue on in the near term, and we're taking that into account as we give you guidance going forward for Q1. On the cash, yes, we have $3 billion of cash domestically. We've been able to -- we've been accessing commercial paper. We increased that a little bit this past quarter. And we've been able to access and get access to capital to take out debt if we need to as we go forward because, again, we are continuing to ensure we have the flexibility we need, whether it's for strategic M&A or to continue with, obviously, our dividend and share repurchase. So we don't see any issues with that going forward, and we'll continue to be as efficient as possible in managing our cash and any debt we need to take out. Paul, are you on mute? Let's go ahead and take the next question. Yes. So Rod, on the inventory, you're correct. A large majority of the inventory increase is driven by memory advanced purchases. So that protects us in -- for a large portion, but we also have been, as I mentioned in the last call, we've also been securing and committing to our purchase commitments for even more access to supply. That also will ensure that we have the supply, albeit, perhaps, at higher prices if they continue to rise. But the bulk of the inventory going up, the $400 million is memory. And then there's also a little bit of just inventory built up as we continue just to execute on our revenue in Q1. And Rod, on the second part, thanks for asking about the service provider business. I think the way I would characterize it is it's less about different portions of the network, and it's really about the disparity across large customers. As I said in the last couple of calls, we literally had some very big customers that were growing double digits and others that were on the opposite side of that. So it really is more of a customer variability issue than it is a single place in the network infrastructure that is causing a problem. And that's what we've seen for several quarters. And again, some of it is based on regulatory issues and geopolitical dynamics. Others are based on consolidation going on in a certain part of the industry. So that's kind of color as to how I see it. Hopefully, that's helpful. Yes. We can hear you now. Yes, sure. So on the shift, first, it's not much different than we told you. It's basically about 2%, between the 1.5% and 2%. And you hit the -- obviously, Security impacts the most. Collaboration has always been that way, and that just continues to grow. But if you restated it Security will be impacted, wireless will be impacted. And now with Cisco ONE really ramping up and added hundreds of millions of dollars on the balance sheet, that would have an impact as well. And that is the piece that will accelerate even more as we get more traction on the Catalyst 9000 switches platform. So it's kind of across the board. In terms of Data Center overall -- so if I look at Switching and Switching being down 9%, the bulk of it was campus switching, and that was over double digit. So that was the biggest drag. data center switching, all-in, was basically flattish to slightly up but basically flattish. And price decline, yes, it is -- you're talking about a year-over-year rate impact? Yes, so it is below the 3%. And you'll see that in the K. Thanks for the question, Simon. The short answer is yes. And what's happened is if you think about how our customers are building their IT infrastructure or how their IT assets are being deployed, they're in a massively distributed mode. And they're trying to navigate and manage technology assets, spanning from the public cloud to connected vehicles, connected mining operations, all the way back to their private data center over to SaaS applications. So the architecture of sort of hair-pinning all that stuff back to a central point in the enterprise is not going to be sustainable. Therefore, we see our customers transitioning to a new -- fundamentally new architecture that's enabled by the network. And that's why they're moving to the security architecture because, as I said, our teams have built this strategy where you have to deploy Security Everywhere, which is at the endpoint in the network in the cloud. And I think as it relates to some of the attacks, I don't remember the number exactly last quarter or the quarter before relative to our -- the threat, new threat customers that we have, the AMP customers. But I believe the 7,600 this quarter was a pretty significant increase over what we saw during a quarter over the last 2 quarters. And I think that's probably related to not only the architectural buy-in that our customers have but also the fact that, that solution was pretty resilient during the recent ransomware attacks. Let me see if I can break this down into 3 sort of qualitative areas that, I think, we are focused on that can actually improve the service provider performance over the next 3 to 7 quarters over the next 2 years. I think first is we have increased our presence, our relevance in the web scale cloud providers that we've talked about. That's first and foremost. Second is there are -- there's innovation that we are working on that we talked a little bit about at the Financial Analyst Conference that will be coming out probably a few quarters from now that will give us some transition opportunities in some of our platforms. And then finally, I think the other is there's -- I would characterize as a combination of sort of macro issues as well as technology transitions. I think you're going to see customers -- and we're beginning to have discussions with customers who are thinking about 5G. And while we're not in the macro radio space, one of the key things that they are working on or thinking about is, as I add a significant number of new devices at higher speeds and lower latency out of the edge of the network, what is that going to mean for the performance I'm going to need in the core of the network? So I think as we see some of the geopolitical dynamics hopefully settle down, but I wouldn't count on that right now, but the overall -- I think the 5G trend and that transition is the other one that could help us over the next couple years. Sure. So on the gross margin, I think we need to -- well, we will have an impact on the memory for the next couple quarters coming up here, for sure. I think the public information out there on what's happening with the supply, there are people that think that maybe it eases up, but it's too hard to call. So I think that's going to be a headwind for us. I think the other parts of gross margin are continuing to -- we're executing and managing those well, like we always have, on the cost savings sides and managing price as well. So I think it's really -- the big question mark and the big headwind is the memory. On rev rec change of ASC 606, we will be giving more color on that in our 10-K and kind of give you a feel of what some of the implications will be. So we'll get more color in that, and we'll try to quantify for you the impact from a revenue and bottom line perspective. I will also just reference you back to -- I did have a page in the analyst conference deck laying out what of our offers would be impacted and what wouldn't be to kind of give you a feel along those lines as well to help you think through it. But we'll give you progressively more detail, starting with our K coming up here in a few weeks. Thanks, Kelly, and thanks, Mark, for the questions. Chuck, why don't I turn it over to you to wrap it up? All right. Thanks, Marilyn. And thanks, everybody, for participating with us today. I think there are 4 key messages that I would probably leave you with. First is that this launch that we announced back about 8 weeks ago was the first of what I believe you should expect from us in just an ongoing cycle of innovation and very positively received by the press, analysts, customers, partners, employees. And I said, when I took this job, we're going to increase the pace of innovation, and this is the first wave of what you're going to see coming from us. And when you look at the innovation that was introduced, particularly around the automation, around the new platform and the innovation we drove in the security capabilities, that's what you're going to see from us going forward. Secondly, I think with the -- our customers and the environments in which they're operating now, the network's never been more relevant. And I talked about how they're building out their infrastructure in very distributed ways. They're managing hundreds and thousands of devices today, and they have to be ready to manage 1 million or more by 2020. And I think that, that is why this automation and analytics capability and the security built into the network is so important. The third is that we continue to have our customers looking for us to help them really build out the secure intelligent platform that spans across this multicloud environment for their digital business. And I think that our Security results on the number of new customers embracing the technology, I think, is indicative of how they're buying into this new architecture. And then fourth, I would say that the strategy we laid out, we're executing very well against. We're managing the business through this transition. When you look at the year that we just completed, having record EPS, record cash flow at the same time that we, this past quarter, increased the software and subscription deferred business, 50% to $5 billion. And so I'm very pleased with where our teams are, what our teams are doing, how we're executing and how we've increased the innovation and the response from our customers. So we look forward to talking to you all again next quarter, and thanks for joining us today. Thanks, Chuck. I'm going to go ahead and provide some last closing remarks here. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2018 first quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 15, 2017, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that, in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team at Cisco. And we thank you very much for joining today's call.","I appreciate the color around the software and our current metrics. Very helpful. I guess just a couple from me. Just a easy clarification, Kelly. You haven't mentioned the number of Cisco ONE customers, would love to get that. And then as to the question itself, Chuck, Switching has had a little bit of a difficulty, or I think 3 out of the 4 quarters was down quite substantially, actually, on a year-over-year basis. As we look into '18, do you -- how do you think about that business in that year? Is that another year of transition where the portfolio, through, for example, your most recent announcements, will go for potential pause and update and learning curve, where that business could still be prone to declines? Or we should finally see some better results in that category? I've given up on the Data Center business. I'd like to get a sense for how you see like your near-term trends in the business. If I look at your revenue guide for next quarter, so we're still slightly down year-on-year, but sequentially, the kind of revenue change you're guiding for is actually probably better than the average seasonality for Q1 of the last few years. So am I right thinking that the environment -- you see the environment, the business environment, slightly improving sequentially after this quarter -- this weaker quarter you were anticipating? So that's on the revenue front. And then on the margin front, I think like from the top of my mind, you've fully been beating your gross margin guidance range for like 8 or 9 quarters in a row or something like that. And your gross margin came in slightly down sequentially. And so -- and you're guiding for a slightly lower operating margin next quarter than what the consensus is anticipating. So if you could give some perspective on what's happening at the gross margin level. It's relatively small movements, but I'm sure you can give us some visibility on what were the drivers there. On the Security side, you said at the Analyst Day you expect low to mid-teens growth. You did talk about strong orders today, but the revenue growth was much less. I think you cited some legacy products holding things back. Do you have confidence that the reported revenue is going to get back into the double digits consistently? My question is on what feedback and commentary you are hearing from your sales teams, your top customers, channel partners in this new model to purchase products like the Catalyst 9k with subscriptions paying OpEx dollars. Hopefully, you get the software security feature attach. And then the next part of the question is, is demand for the subscriptions OpEx model primarily coming from your U.S. corporate customers? Or are you also... Okay. So I think, yes, the question is what commentary you are hearing from your customers and channel partners and your sales teams on purchasing these newer products such as the Catalyst 9k with software and security features using the subscriptions model. And is it... Can you guys hear me now? Yes. So yes, I think the first part of the question is the commentary from your customers on purchasing new products with subscriptions model. The second part of the question is, is the demand for the subscriptions model primarily coming from U.S. customers? Or are you seeing overseas demand as well for subscriptions-based purchasing? Just wanted to check in on the web scale client base. How's that -- how did that trend in the quarter? Can you also address the kind of the Switching and routing competitive environment there? It seems like white box really not taking off, but some of your competitors are having good traction. So if you could just update us on progress with that large customer base, that's great. I have actually 2 questions, but it's about margin and cash. You touched on it a little bit, but you knew about memory pricing when you entered the quarter, I think, when you gave the guidance. Still, product gross margin was weak. What was the delta? What was weaker than expected during the quarter that drove gross margin down? And the second question is cash repatriation, if it doesn't happen. You already now have $70 billion in cash but only $3 billion in the U.S. So do you consider Plan B for bringing the cash to the U.S.? Or any other use for the cash? Just 2 clarifications from Kelly and then the question -- clarifications being, Kelly, you mentioned the tick-up in price erosion. Did that remain below 3%? And then on the other clarification, on the Switching commentary, can you give us the data center Switching growth all-in beyond just the ACI portfolio and what the campus switching decline was? And the real question is, looking at the drag on growth from the shift to subscriptions, what was (technical difficulty) I wanted to, Kelly, maybe get you to comment on the inventory movement. The inventory's up quite a bit this quarter. I'm assuming that might be forward purchasing in memory. And then I assume that might protect your margin looking forward. But I wonder if you -- could you confirm that? And if it is the case that it's memory, how long are you protected? How long are you hedged? And then also, Chuck, maybe going back to that carrier order volume, could you just maybe dig into where you're seeing weakness in orders in the network? Can you help us pinpoint that? Or is it more broad and related to product slowdown? Just kind of generally from a part of the network point of view, where is that sluggishness materializing? Chuck, Kelly, Marilyn, can you hear me? So let me ask you a question and 2 clarifications, the question being, what was the drag on growth from the shift to subscriptions this quarter? And can you talk about what your product segment growth would look like on a normalized basis, i.e., adjusting for the shift in subscriptions? I'm aware that wireless WAN in Collaboration have been the 2 places where -- in Security, where it's been first implemented. But can you talk to us about what the growth will look like on a product line basis correcting for that? And the clarification, Kelly, you mentioned the tick-up in price erosion. Was it still below 3%? And can you tell us what the decline in campus switching was and what was the all-in growth rate of Data Center? So not just ACI but taking into account the 7,000 and whatever other products are in that. And price decline? Yes. I wanted to see if we could maybe double-click down on the Security business. In light of the headlines we've heard in the security space over the last couple months in terms of attacks, I think of the case of Nuance, it highlighted employing Cisco. And I recall your discussions in the past about the need for security to be an architectural solution and not a point solution. So it sounds like the market is moving towards the pitch you've made, and it's made sense for a long time. I'm just trying to see if you can help us quantify the outlook for your Security business, if you see an inflection point of the business moving more towards a solution sale than point products versus what we've seen in the past. I would like to delve into the service provider outlook a little bit, if we could. It sounds as though -- we understand that things aren't perfect around the world for you. My question is, how much of where we are in service provider do you consider to be cyclical? And how much of this is structural? I mean, do you think that we should see the service provider orders be in that 1% to 3% growth range that you've highlighted for the overall business? Just want to follow up on the gross margin question, a lot of focus today on the call. How should investors anticipate potential margin volatility over the next 1 to 2 years related to the transition to the highly attractive subscription model? And then, Kelly, can you weigh in on rev rec 606? Like when could we see Cisco introduce some guidance around that as well?

CSCO,Q2 2017,2573,3105,1524,"Thanks, Sam.  Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second-quarter FY17 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be available on our website in the investor relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our investor relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of FY17. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2 FY16 on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment portion of our SP Video connected devices business, and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q2 FY17. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call also has been normalized in the same way. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We performed well this quarter, delivering total revenue of $11.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57. We drove strong profitability, healthy cash flow, and growth in deferred revenue, continuing our shift towards software and recurring revenue. We also drove 51% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions, which now stands at $4 billion. We're also pleased that the Board approved a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.29. We are delivering against our strategic priorities, offering unparalleled value to our customers, and we're executing and managing the Business to deliver greater shareholder return. Through a disciplined investment approach, we are focused on expanding our growth opportunities and strengthening our customer value proposition. We were very pleased to announce our intent to acquire AppDynamics as a continuation of our strategy to provide customers with deep analytics across the data center, the network, as well as their applications. Increasingly, customers are seeing significant business value being delivered through applications and access through intelligent networks. Combining Cisco's infrastructure, networking, and security analytics with the application analytics from AppDynamics, we will provide customers with unprecedented insights to improve business performance. The conversations I have every day with business and government leaders around the world reinforce the importance of our strategy. They look to Cisco to connect everything and everyone by building highly secure, software-defined, automated, and intelligent infrastructure platforms.  We offer these solutions through a variety of consumption options, giving our customers choice and flexibility. I would now like to cover some key business highlights, starting with our Security business. We had another great quarter in Security, which continued its strong momentum and growth. Revenue grew 14%, and deferred revenue grew 45%, reflecting the strength of our best-of-breed offerings and architectural approach to security from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Two weeks ago, we released the 10th annual Cisco cybersecurity report which highlights the increasing risk customers are facing around the world. Of the organizations we surveyed, over one-third of those who experienced a breach in 2016 reported substantial losses to their business. Customers are relying on Cisco's comprehensive portfolio of best-of-breach security products and services brought together in an integrated architectural approach to prevent and reduce the risk of business loss. As a proof point, deployments of our advanced threat solutions continue to be strong, as we added over 6,000 new customers, bringing the total to approximately 29,000 now using AMP, which led to revenue growth of 65% in the quarter. Similar to our success in the advanced threat market, we added over 5,500 next-generation firewall customers, bringing our total customer base to 67,500. In addition to our leadership in network and advanced security, Cisco is leading the market in delivering innovative, cloud-based security solutions. Last week, we announced Cisco Umbrella, the industry's first secure Internet Gateway to address new enterprise security challenges in today's mobile and cloud world. Cisco Umbrella is designed to help users gain secure access to the Internet anywhere they go, even when they are off the enterprise network. Now, let's turn to collaboration. This quarter, we saw strong customer growth across our collaboration portfolio, with revenue growing 4% and deferred revenue growing 14%. Further expanding our portfolio of subscription-based offerings, we introduced Cisco's Spark Board, the first all-in-one, cloud-based collaboration and meeting room solution. Cisco Spark Board enables screen sharing, interactive white-boarding, and video conferencing, and is complemented by a new version of our Cisco Spark application, a messaging and meeting platform for mobile and desktop endpoints. In the few weeks since launch, we have already had several hundred Cisco Spark Board customers who will be receiving ongoing innovation as part of the Cisco Spark subscription that they purchased together with the device. We are seeing good customer momentum in our Data Center business, with customers choosing Cisco for the breadth of our private and hybrid cloud solutions. Across our next-generation data center portfolio, we saw healthy customer traction, including our ACI data center switching portfolio grew revenue by 28%.  This includes 1,300 new Nexus 9000 customers and 450 new ACI customers in Q2, bringing the total install base to 10,800 and 3,100, respectively. We are the only company to offer end-to-end visibility and security for 100 gig network build-outs. In our core business, the network has never been more relevant in a world of increasing connectivity driven by cloud, social, IoT, and digitization. Over the last year, we have been working hard on driving innovation in our core business, and we are starting to see some of the benefits, such as our wireless portfolio this quarter. We believe we are in the early stages of a product innovation cycle driven by security, automation, and analytics across the portfolio. To further strengthen our cloud software and IoT portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, we announced our intent to acquire AppDynamics, a market leader in application intelligence whose solutions are helping the world's largest companies improve their application and business performance. Customers will now have unprecedented insight into their data center, security infrastructure, and networking performance through real-time application analytics in the cloud and on-premise. Approximately 75% of AppDynamics product revenue is subscription-based, which aligns well with the way customers increasingly want to consume technology and with Cisco's strategic objective of moving towards more recurring revenue. The growing customer demand for real-time data is enabled by the increasing number of connected devices. We continue to build on the Jasper cloud IoT platform with new solutions. Today, Jasper connects more than 40 million devices, including over 12 million connected vehicles, and we are adding more than 1.5 million new devices per month. The number of enterprise customers utilizing data from the Jasper platform has grown from 4,000 a year ago to more than 9,000 this quarter. In summary, we are confident in our strategy. We are delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio. And we are pleased with the momentum across our businesses, and in our strategic shift towards recurring software- and subscription-based revenue. Now, let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q2 results and outlook in more detail. Okay, great.  Thanks, Chuck. So, I will start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter, followed by some comments about our capital allocation and the Q3 outlook. Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter, with revenue of $11.6 billion, down 2%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, flat year over year. We continued to make progress on our strategic growth priorities, while maintaining rigorous discipline on profitability and cash generation. As part of our strategy to drive long-term profitable growth, we are prioritizing key investments, both organically and inorganically, such as the intended acquisition of AppDynamics. Today, our Board approved an increase of $0.03 to the quarterly dividend, bringing it to $0.29 per share, a 12% increase, representing a yield of approximately 3.5% on today's closing price. We remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy and returning value to our shareholders. Let me provide some more details on our revenue breakdown. Total product revenue was down 4%, and let me walk through each of the product areas. Switching declined 5%, driven by weakness in Campus, partially offset by strength in the ACI portfolio, which was up 28%. Routing was down 10%, although we did see growth in orders. Collaboration grew 4%, driven by ongoing solid performance of WebEx, Unified Communications, and TelePresence. We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions in SaaS offers with deferred revenue growing 14%. Data Center declined 4%, impacted by the continued market shift from blade to rack, though last week we announced expansion of our UCS portfolio by offering the Microsoft Azure stack on UCS via an integrated validated system that enables organizations to deliver Microsoft Azure services from their on-premise data centers. The joint Cisco and Microsoft solution provides the tools for enterprises to grow and modernize their applications in a highly flexible and scalable hybrid cloud environment. Wireless grew 3%, with ongoing strength in Meraki and the continued ramp of our 11ac Wave 2 portfolio. Security grew 14%, with deferred revenue growth of 45%, as we offer more solutions to customers with increasing software content that results in greater recurring revenue. We had very strong performance in our advanced threat security of 65%, as well as strength in unified threat management and web security solutions. Our focus continues to be developing a best-of-breed portfolio, while offering customers the benefit of deep architectural integration spanning the network cloud endpoint, which we believe is outpacing our competitors. Services continues to execute well, growing 5%, with a strong focus on renewals and attach rates. Overall, we drove13% growth in total deferred revenue, with product up 19% and services up 9%. We continued to build our product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription businesses to $4 billion, up 51%. We made good progress on increasing our recurring revenue, with 31% of our total Q2 revenue generated from recurring offers, up from 28% a year ago. In terms of orders, total product orders growth was flat, with book-to-bill greater than 1. Let's take a look at our geographies, which is the primary way we run the Business. We are seeing continued strength in the Americas, which grew 4%. EMEA was down 4%, and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets declined 7%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 5%. In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 1%, commercial grew 3%, public sector was down 6%, and service provider declined 1%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total gross margin was 64.1%, down slightly by 0.1 points. Our product gross margin was 62.4%, down 0.9 points, and service gross margin was 68.8%, growing 2.1 points. Operating margin was solid at 31%. We are maintaining our discipline and driving productivity with an ongoing focus of cost improvements and operational efficiencies, making the necessary trade-off to drive operating margin. At the bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 and GAAP EPS of $0.47. We delivered operating cash flow of $3.8 billion, and ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $71.8 billion, with $9.6 billion available in the US.  From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter, that included $1 billion for share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we had solid performance in Q2 and managed the Business well. We're making the investments we need to deliver shareholder value over the long term, and we are being very disciplined in driving continuous cost efficiencies. Let me now reiterate our guidance for the third quarter. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. As a reminder, the third quarter of last year included an extra week, which resulted in higher revenue of $265 million, and higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million, netting into $115 million of non-GAAP operating income. The guidance for the third quarter is as follows. We expect revenue in the range of minus 2% to 0% year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.57 to $0.59. My guidance does not reflect any impact from AppDynamics.  I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments. Thanks, Kelly. Once again, we had a solid quarter, and I am pleased with how we're executing against our strategy. Let me summarize why I am confident in our ability to bring even greater value to our customers, partners, and shareholders. First, we delivered strong innovation in key areas such as security, collaboration, and next-generation data center, as we continue to also drive innovation in our core. Second, we have strong momentum in our transition, as seen with 51% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions, as we continue to add more software offers like you see with Cisco Spark Board.   Third, profitable growth: We continue to stay focused on driving productivity and operational efficiencies. Lastly, we remain committed to increasing shareholder return, as you've seen with our dividend increase of 12%. Our customers have never cared more about what technology can do for their business. They are looking for speed, agility, visibility, and security in everything that they do. Cisco is uniquely qualified to meet these demands with our ability to drive automation analytics with intelligence and security, all the way from the network to the application. And that's why I am confident in our future. Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions. Great. Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. I just wanted to remind folks -- while Sam is doing that, I'd like to remind the audience that we ask you to ask one question.","Thanks, Pierre. Let me just start, and then, Kelly, you can add whatever you like here.  I think as it relates to our core portfolio, we have seen, obviously, some macro dynamics. Europe is clearly stressed with all the geopolitical dynamics that are occurring in Europe right now across several countries. And we also have begun to invest pretty significantly over the last year, and you'll  see it over the coming year, in ensuring we had the appropriate investments in innovation in our core.  But, you also see what we did with AppDynamics, and what I would tell you is that when you combine the analytics that we can deliver out of the data center with the analytics that we will deliver out of the core networking space with our security threat information and analytics out of our security portfolio combined with the application analytics that they have, we believe that we can create a differentiated architecture for our customers going forward.  And, that's what we are -- that's the purpose in the acquisition and what we intend to do going forward. So, Kelly, any other comments on the macro and the sequentials? No. I think just to add to that, I think, we do feel good about what we're seeing from macro in the US certainly and in commercial and enterprise. And, I would say to your point, Pierre, when you do adjust for that extra week last year, we are -- our guide -- we always call it like we see it, and it does show a bit of improvement there on both the top line and bottom line. So, I think like Chuck said, I think that the US is solid, and again, we're still cautious on outside the US and Europe and Asia. Great.  Thanks, Kelly. Sam, we will go ahead and take our next question. I think it was Justin, right?  Justin, thanks for the question. It's pretty timely. In fact, we -- obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty on the Ericsson side, and we believe that all the original business drivers that led us to establish the partnership with Ericsson are still very valid. I think we have had some 300 customer engagements together, and their new CEO came on board just about five weeks ago, I believe. And, we have been in a great deal of discussion since then on ways in which we could accelerate the partnership.  He is committed to continuing and trying to make this as successful as we possibly can.  We're going to meet again in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress, and I would say we're focused right now on how do we accelerate from here. Thanks, Justin. Sam will go ahead and take the next question please. I think what I say is between 1% and 2%. So, we are in that 1.5% to 2% range. Again, as we continue to accelerate the growth -- as we're continuing to grow it like we have been growing -- I referred it.  It may get even more until it evens out, but in the last few quarters, it has been in that range. Thanks, Paul. Sam, we will take the next question. We don't share gross margins by businesses, but I can tell you the margins are growing in our security portfolio overall between the mix of the growth in these areas and the acquisitions of the SaaS businesses we've been adding. So, it's very accretive to the Cisco average. Mitch, first priority will be strategic investments that we will make, and then, obviously, followed with a focus on continued capital allocation and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders.  It would be a combination. Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and tee up for the next question. Thanks, Jeff. So, as we look at MSDC what we've given you over the last few quarters is a very fixed list of 10 customers that we have given. And, I have said over and over that we have been spending a lot of time with these customers, really focused on understanding what their unique needs are.  Frankly, some of them are so big they are a market of one unto themselves, and I'm very pleased with the progress we're making. If you look at those 10 just to give you the numbers this time. Overall, those 10 would be down, but if you normalize out one of those providers and you take the combination of the other nine, and that one had some pretty tough year-over-year comps. The other nine were up double digits, and we have one of the largest that was up triple digits for the second quarter in a row. So, I feel like we are making good progress, but we still have a long way to go. Thanks for the question, Jeff.  We will go ahead and take the next question, Sam. Thanks, Ittai. We can always count on you for that question.  (laughter) First of all, I think in our next-gen data center switching portfolio, you can see continued performance and continued good adoption of those solutions from our customer base. I think on the hyperconverged, we certainly would like to see it moving more quickly. We have recently had a release of software that has helped with some of the capabilities, and I think that there are a couple more coming that should continue to give us more capabilities in that space.  I think that we are also looking, as you would expect, at our broad strategy in the data center and where we need to go to ensure that we best position ourselves going forward. So, that work is going on as well right now, Ittai. Thanks, Chuck.  Sam, let's go ahead and tee up the next question. Vijay, don't mean to interrupt.  Can you speak up just a little bit? We're having trouble hearing you. Not really. Try a little louder. That's better. It's a great question. I think that when you look at the improvement we've been making around our transition to software and subscription business, you can assume that we will continue to look for people who have those kinds of capabilities.  And, if you look at even the AppDynamics acquisition, David Wadhwani, who is their CEO, was one of the key drivers behind the software transition that occurred at Adobe so he very much understands how this transition will occur. You can assume that we are adding talent in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, software skills around simplicity and automation.  As you know if you look at our core, one of the biggest things are customers are looking for is to take out the cost of operating this infrastructure. And so, as we build out automation capabilities that allow them to very dynamically change their environments as opposed to the manual way it has been done in the past -- those skill sets as well. So, it's a combination of all those in addition to security and all the other areas you mentioned. So, it's broad-based. Thanks for the question, Vijay. We'll go ahead and take the next question. That's a great question, Steve. So, actually, product as a percentage of my total product revenue -- it is up to 10% now this quarter for the first time. So, we're happy about that. And, we are trying to make that shift in the core part of the business. Cisco 1 is an example of where we are taking our ELAs and our big cross-enterprise ELAs that really are our core networking business to do that. So, we're trying to find ways to find other offers. I will just point to another example though like the Spark Board that Chuck mentioned. It's a great new innovation and extension of TelePresence, but it's a great example of where we are selling that -- we used to sell it always as a system, now we're selling the equipment. But, we are selling it with a subscription. So, that's an example of how we have been able to drive new offers that had been traditionally just pure system or hardware. And, again, the teams are driving hard to find more ways to accelerate new offers that way. Steve, I want to just make a couple comments on this. One, if you look -- six quarters ago when I came into the job, our overall revenue -- our recurring revenue was 26%.  In the first four quarters, we spent time taking our teams and helping our teams understand the transition that we were going to make. So, in the first four quarters, we gained 2 points.  We took it up to 28%, and in the last two quarters, we've added 3 points. So, we've accelerated it.  It has gone to 31% in the last two quarters. And, on the product side, that went from 6% to 7% in the first year, and then in the last two quarters, it's gone from 7% to 10%. I think we are finding ways to move that forward. As it relates to the core, I think you'll see us come out with services around automation and analytics and other things that will be sold as subscriptions on top of the platforms. And, the last thing I will tell you is that we pulled some of -- one of the key leaders from the security portfolio who had really driven the whole product management portion of that transition to the heavy content of software and subscription that you see today, and he is now leading that for us in our core networking space in the enterprise networking. So, it's clearly a focus that he is trying to drive for us. We will take the next question. Mark, first off, I'll take the repatriation and the M&A question, and Kelly, you can take the next one. So, you are free to make comments on mine as well. (laughter) I think our M&A strategy is going to remain intact. Repatriation doesn't fundamentally change how we think about what we're going to do going forward. You can assume that we will continue to look for opportunities to drive the business value and the relevance to our customers like we did with AppD.  They have a tremendous platform that really translates application analytics to real business performance information for our customers. And, just to comment on AppDynamics, they have a very robust enterprise solution that is delivered either from the cloud or on-premise and can be delivered to the customer on-premise or in the cloud. So, it's very flexible. And, they basically have 275 of the Fortune 2000, and they really have never had a substantial partner model. Those are the reasons we think that makes a lot of sense. So, strategic alignment and the ability for us to take it through our ecosystem are always positive. Kelly, comments on the deferred and the margins? On the deferred, Mark, that is part of why we're trying to make this shift to software. Our customers want those offers and to have an easier way to run their IT departments. It clearly enables us to get higher margins, for sure. And, it's not only just the gross margins coming out of deferred revenue, but we are looking at our whole end-to-end operations and how we go to market, how we drive operations in the back end here.  And, there is really opportunities to drive both gross margins and operating margins. So, that's why we are so focused on it.  That's why we are looking at acquisitions to add to it, and it will continue to help improve our mix on the margins line. Thanks, Chuck and Kelly. Sam, let's go ahead and take the next question. Sure, I will take that one and a great question. Gross margins, we have been -- again, continue to operate well. I will say there were two specific headwinds that we faced this quarter. And, to your point on APJC, I will refer back to a year ago we were benefiting from a national program in China where they were rolling out set-top boxes to tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Not our set-top boxes, but we were providing the smart cards to go with that which were -- they are basically for secure access, and it was very, very high margin. So, we had if you go back a year ago, SP Video in Asia was extremely strong because of that. That program has dramatically slowed down.  And, again, that pure margin just isn't there any more, and you are seeing that flow through both the margins and the year-over-year revenues for both SP Video and APJC. The other item that's a headwind for us this quarter is we are facing a significant cost increase to our memory costs -- our DRAM memory costs that we are paying.  It's a very tight supply right now. And, we are seeing dramatic increases there. So, that's hurting us quite a bit as well. But, other than that, I would say the color is in the same line.  Our pricing is in the ranges that we have been the last six to eight quarters.   I'd say a little on the higher end, but in line with where we were Q3, Q4. A little worse than last quarter, but we were very low last quarter. So, in the normal ranges. It really those two specific things. I will say that I do anticipate those two headwinds to remain there next quarter as well as we had very strong SP Video -- that China program in Q3 as well. Let's go ahead and take the next question, Sam. Sure. I will start on the supplier component issue. So, yes, those articles are out there. We have had an issue from a supplier come out. And, we did book a reserve for $125 million you can see in our GAAP results and in the press release to cover that. We always and continue to stand by our customers through any situations like this.  This is very proactive. This is a failure rate that will happen over time, but we are working with our customers to work through that so we're not anticipating any impact from that from a top line perspective. I will take the SP portion, Kelly. So, Jess, on the service provider space, it's really similar to last time. We talked about SP CapEx -- different service providers are looking at different areas of investment depending on what's going on in their network.  So, you have some who are looking at macro radio densification as an example, and others are looking at building out capacity in the quarter. And so, we have -- and it's a segment that is very dominated by large customers. So, from a quarter-to-quarter basis, any number of customers that make any shift in their buying behavior can have an impact either positively or negatively.  It's a space that I will just encourage you to look at longer term, but we did see -- we saw a definite improvement. We saw -- I would say from a regional perspective what I would tell you is the Americas was very strong.  And, we saw general weakness in Europe and then the China space you had a lot of this SP Video implication that Kelly was talking about earlier. So, overall, I think the teams did a great job. We have -- I think the teams are working incredibly well on the next generation of capabilities in the platforms and in some of the software and automation and some of the same themes that we've been talking about in the enterprise core networks.  I feel good about where they are right now. Thanks for the question, Jess. We'll go ahead and take the next question, Sam. Sure. So, that 51% growth is year-over-year growth of over $1.3 billion. And, everything is growing in that space. I would say from a pure size, collaboration and security and Meraki are the biggest pieces of that because they have just continued to grow their businesses significantly, and they are all growing huge double digits. But, I will also say my switching and my routing as well as data center, we've done fiscal one bundles as well as big enterprise license agreements.  They've also been growing huge double digits as well. So, at the end of the day, the year-over-year increases across the board, everything is up massively to drive to that 51%.  And, again, just the biggest chunk of it between collaboration, security, and wireless, they are two-thirds I would say of the balance but the other pieces -- . Wireless being Meraki. Wireless being Meraki, yes. Hopefully, that gives you the color you are looking for. All right.  Thanks, Kelly. Sam, let's go ahead and take that next question. All right. Thank you. That was our last question for today. I'm going to turn it over to Chuck for some closing remarks. Just a couple of comments, and first of all, I want to just thank you all again for joining us today. We did deliver strong innovation, I believe, which was reflective in the performance that we've had in security collaboration, next-gen data center, and we continue to drive innovation in our core enterprise and SP portfolio. The deferred revenue from our subscription and software business is indicative, I think, of the transition that you should continue to expect from us. We will continue to focus on driving profitable growth with productivity and operational efficiencies, and you also can count on the fact that we remain very committed to our shareholder return as was indicated in both our buybacks and our dividend, and then, the increase in the dividend this quarter. So, I just want to thank all of you for being with us today.  And then, Marilyn, I will let you take it from here.  Thank you. Thank you, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect all our FY17 third quarter results will be on Wednesday, May 17, 2017 at 1.30 PM Pacific time, 4.30 PM  Eastern time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out and contact the Cisco investor relations group, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.","Hi.  Thank you for taking my question. I was trying to understand where we stand in the weakness you saw when you talked about three months ago. If I look at your guide, it's very encouraging.  It shows that you were getting back to a sequential growth that is better than slightly above what you have done on average in recent years. And then, if I hear your comments, Campus was very weak in the quarter.  Routing as well.  And, you see orders coming back in routing.  My question would be whether you see something similar in Campus?  Can we expect that part of the business to improve in coming months and coming quarters?  And then, maybe just more broadly, what's your feeling about the macro today?  The uncertainty and the weakness in orders you could see three months ago, is this something that is improving now, already? This is Justin on for Jim Suva.  Thanks, Chuck and Kelly, for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on your partnership with Ericsson?  I know recently you've had a couple of different rollouts and then some good press releases in terms of what you are doing. I'm just wondering if you could maybe provide any updates or any milestones now that it's been about a year since you've had the partnership going? Thanks. If I could ask for a quick clarification and then a question. Kelly, I think last quarter you quantified the impact of the shift in the business model is over 2 percentage points in terms of the hit to growth as you increase your future visibility on the shift. Can you update -- I don't think I heard you give an update this quarter? Okay, and would that be your expectation on an ongoing basis? Thanks for taking my question. I want to circle back on the security piece.  You have given out advanced threat numbers in the past and the breakdown there. So, how does the margin structure change as you grow the advanced threat and the web security piece versus the legacy security portfolio that you've had? Just one quick, small follow-up. Just on a repatriation potential, are you leaning more towards essentially M&A or buybacks or a dividend because you have raised it by 12% now.  Just wondering how you think about that? Yes.  Thank you very much for taking the question.  One of the big themes with some of the other folks across the [com] landscape is web scale. That wasn't a major theme of the opening script. I am hoping that you could help us understand your positioning in web scale.  Certainly in switching where the competition is heightened and also in routing and even DCI. Thank you. Thanks. Chuck, appreciate the opportunity. I guess I'm going to sound like a broken record and ask the same question I've asked over four or five quarters now which is your data center revenue. Your server business which has again continued to stay in range. Not showing much progress. How do you feel about the progress that you are making over there with hyperconverged?  It just doesn't seem to be moving the dial [be it]?  How do you resolve the issues in this business going forward? Thanks. Hi Chuck, Kelly. I'd like to get bigger picture thoughts, Chuck and Kelly, on how you plan to broaden your senior management team?  Any new areas or skill sets you will be looking for in the management team to drive profit and growth through the rest of this year and over the next few years?  And, is the strategy focused primarily on doubling down on security, analytics, AI, automation? Can you hear me now? Okay. Is this better? Okay. Chuck, my question was more on the senior management team. Any new skill sets, any new areas or avenues you will be looking for to round out the management team to drive top line growth?  Or, will you primarily be doubling down on security, analytics, AI? Thank you. Thank you. Kelly, you mentioned the percentage of recurrent revenues, 31%.  If you exclude services, are we still around 9% to 10% of product revenue being recurring?  And, is there any way to turn that core routing switching business into something more recurring?  We've never seen a hardware Company do that, if you will.  But, through ELAs or something else, is there any way to turn that into little more of a subscription -- consistent basis? Thanks.  Good afternoon.  Just following up on the cash repatriation M&A question, Chuck. Just want to get a sense going forward, should we think about a continuation of more of the string of pearls approach similar to AppDynamics?  Or, can you make more sizable acquisitions? And then, Kelly, I wanted to get a sense if you could help us understand how we should think about deferred revenue, clearly growing nicely.  What is the feedback loop 1 year, 1.5 years out from now in terms of does gross margin start to trend higher because of the deferred revenue mix is becoming [richer] in configuration? Thank you. Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about product gross margins. They were a bit weaker than we had at least modeled, and I think in the 8-K, there's some indication that there was some pricing. But, I would like some more color there. Particularly, one thing that we noticed that the APAC margins were look particularly weak.  Is this related to customer, geography?  Just a little help on understanding where the pressures are on [product gross] margin? Hi.  Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice quarter. First, just had a clarification.  There were a number of articles regarding a faulty clocking component over the last few weeks.  Just wanted to see if you could comment to what degree that is or isn't impacting customer activities?  And then, the question -- I was hoping you might be able to update us in a little greater detail regarding the trends you're seeing in the service provider vertical?  You mentioned some encouraging order development?   So, was hoping you could help us understand what you are seeing across geographies?  What you are seeing from a product perspective?  And, to what degree that improvement is coming from routing optical security or some other part of the service provider business? Great.  Thank you for taking my question here. I wanted a little bit of hand-holding and help with interpreting this deferred revenue growth. 51%, obviously, a very big number. Looking at the balance sheet, it looks like it rose year-over-year by about $1.9 billion, and you talked about the total of software and recurring revenue at $4 billion. Could you help us get a better understanding of what are the components?  And, I'm presuming there are some elements that maybe are growing much slower, some growing faster.  So, help us understand what are the big drivers for that 51% growth. Thank you. Not as of right now. Again, we're working very proactively with our customers in terms of how quickly and where they want to do their replacement. So, we're working very, very closely.  But, as of right now, we have not seen and don't anticipate any massive revenue impact from this.

CSCO,Q3 2017,2349,3879,1350,"Thanks, Shaun. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. Our results this quarter demonstrated that we are delivering against our strategic priorities and realizing the benefits of our investments to transform our business and drive long-term shareholder value. We delivered a solid quarter, with total revenue of $11.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60. We had strong margins yet again and great operating cash flow, up 10%. We are managing the business well through a multiyear transformation of the company while remaining focused on delivering customers unparalleled value through highly secure, software-defined automated and intelligent infrastructure. We are on a journey, which as we consistently stated, will take a number of years, but we are pleased with the progress we're making. As our customers add billions of new connections in the years ahead, the network will become more critical than ever. They will be looking for intelligent networks that deliver automation, security and analytics that help them derive meaningful business value from these connections. These will be delivered through a combination of new platforms as well as software and subscription-based services, which we've been focused on accelerating over the last 18 months. My vision for this company is to be the most relevant and most important partner for our customers as they enable their digital businesses, and we will deliver on that vision. I look forward to discussing this in a lot more detail at our Investor Day on June 28. We continue to innovate across our networking portfolio with analytics being a key element of this innovation. This quarter, we completed the acquisition of AppDynamics, enabling us to provide customers with unprecedented visibility across networking, data center, security and applications. As I talk to our customers and partners, I'm getting great feedback about the value of the insights AppDynamics provides to help them make informed business decisions. We are in the early stages of scaling out the AppDynamics solutions through the Cisco Salesforce and partner ecosystem, and I'm excited about the future of this space. We were also pleased to announce our intent to acquire some new additions to our software and analytics portfolio. Software-defined WAN is a critical market transition and addresses the evolving customer demands and branch routing as a foundational block of executing in cloud networking. Viptela, combined with Cisco's IWAN technology, will provide an industry-leading cloud-first SD WAN platform that addresses the Edge networking needs of our most demanding customers. MindMeld provides an AI platform to build intelligent and humanlike conversational interfaces for any application or device and will complement our already strong collaboration portfolio. These acquisitions support our goal of offering customers extraordinary value through a combination of organic and inorganic innovation, and they are aligned to our strategy of investing to drive longer-term growth and helping us transition to more recurring software and subscription revenue. We will continue to deploy our capital resources to give us first-mover advantage as we extend our technology portfolio. In addition to our inorganic growth, we are seeing strong organic growth of our next-generation products and solutions in both networking and security. Now let me share some business highlights, starting with our security business, which has never been more relevant, as we've seen in recent days. Last week's WannaCry ransomware attack was another example of the devastating impact cybercrime can inflict on individuals, companies and countries around the world. Since Friday's attack, our Talos cyber threat intelligence team has been working around-the-clock to dissect the WannaCry ransomware, understand its attack patterns and keep our customers protected. It's important that the tech industry and customers work together to defend against these attacks from cyber criminals. We will continue to do everything we can to help our customers anticipate, prevent and protect themselves from any future attack by harnessing the intelligence of the network and the power of our security portfolio. Our security business delivered another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth and 39% deferred revenue growth, reflecting our combination of best-of-breed solutions, together with the industry's broadest security portfolio and a highly effective end-to-end security architecture. We continue to lead in network security. Our next-generation firewall portfolio grew 49% with 6,000 new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer base to over 73,000. We expanded our portfolio with the announcement of our Firepower 2100 Series, which offers both performance and protection for mission-critical applications. Our Advanced threat portfolio continues to deliver strong revenue growth of over 30%, and we added 6,600 new customers, bringing the total number of AMP customers to over 35,000. Now let's turn to collaboration. In January, we introduced Cisco's Spark Board, the first all-in-one cloud-based collaboration and meeting room solution. We've seen good early traction with this SaaS-based service, with nearly 700 customers adopting this solution in the quarter. This is a great example of the transition I mentioned earlier focused on moving from standalone systems to best-of-breed products, combined with software subscriptions. Our intended acquisition of MindMeld will help us simplify and enhance the collaboration experience even further through the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As chat and voice quickly become the interfaces of choice, MindMeld's AI technology will enable Cisco to deliver unique experiences throughout its portfolio. This acquisition will power new conversational interfaces for Cisco's collaboration products, revolutionizing how users will interact with our technology while increasing ease-of-use and enabling new capabilities. For example, users will be able to interact with Cisco Spark via Natural Language Commands, providing an experience that is highly customized to the user and their work. In our data center switching business, we now have a combined install base of over 20,000 customers, who are using our portfolio to help them build, run and manage their private and hybrid cloud environments. Our ACI portfolio grew 42%, as customers moved to 100-gig and look to automate the network and increase network performance, visibility and security. We added almost 1,200 new Nexus 9K customers in the quarter, bringing the total installed base to 12,000. Our APIC adoption continues to increase rapidly with over 380 new ACI customers in Q3, bringing our total to nearly 3,500. Before I turn it over to Kelly, let me reiterate a few key points. I'm pleased with the progress we're making. As I've consistently stated, this transition will take time, but we are remaking this company to succeed in a dramatically changing marketplace. We are laser-focused on delivering innovation as well as aggressively managing the business to optimize profitability, cash flows and value for our shareholders. Kelly? Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the Q4 outlook. Q3 was a solid quarter with financial results consistent with our expectations. We executed well, driving solid profitability, strong cash flow, and we continued to deliver on our strategic growth priorities. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, down 1%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.60, up 5%, and operating cash flow grew 10% to $3.4 billion. We generated 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers, up from 29% a year ago. We continue to be extremely focused on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin to 32.3%, up 2.3 points. Before I go through Q3 in more detail, I want to remind you that Q3 last year included an extra week, it resulted in higher revenue in that quarter of $265 million, $200 million of which was in Services and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx and some from product distributions. We also had higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million. This netted to $115 million of higher non-GAAP operating income last year. So onto this quarter. Total product revenue was flat year-over-year. I'll walk through each of the product areas. Switching grew 2%, with solid growth in data center switching, driven by ongoing strength in the ACI portfolio, which was up 42%. We also saw a slight positive growth in our campus business. Routing was down 2%, driven primarily by weakness in mobile packet core. Collaboration was down 4%, but adjusting for the extra week last year, it was down 2%. The drivers are primarily a decline in Unified Communications' endpoints, partially offset by continued growth in WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 10%. Data center declined 5% with the continued market shift from blade to rack. However, we are seeing solid traction with our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex. This quarter, we also further extended our innovations in UCS with new converged solutions for IBM versus stack and with our strategic alliance with Docker to deliver containerized applications. Wireless grew 13% with strong Meraki performance as well as the ramp of our 11 AC Wave 2 portfolio. We continue to innovate with the launch in the quarter of new wireless networking solutions, including a new Wave 2 access point and a wireless controller. Security was up 9% with strong performance in unified threat management, with growth of approximately 50% as well as growth of over 30% in both advanced threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 39%, demonstrating the value of our solutions and ongoing delivery of innovation. Services was down 2%. Normalized for the extra week, it grew 4%. We're continuing to focus on renewals and attach rates. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was 13% in total, with product up 26% and services up 7%. Deferred products revenue from our recurring software and subscription businesses was up 57% to $4.4 billion, which includes the acquisition of AppDynamics during the Quarter. Excluding AppDynamics, the increase was 51%. In terms of orders, total product orders declined 4%. Looking at our geographies, which is a primary way we run the business, Americas was down 4%, EMEA was down 6% and APJC grew 2%. Total emerging markets declined 12%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 10%. In our customer segments, Enterprise declined 2%, Commercial grew 1%, Public Sector was down 4%, and Service Provider declined 10%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total gross margin was 64.4%, down by 0.8 points. In Q3 '16, the extra week resulted in a 0.5 point benefit in that quarter. So adjusting for that, total gross margin decreased 0.3 points. In Q3 '17, our Product gross margin was 63.2%, down 1.3 points, and Service gross margin was 67.8%, growing 0.7 points. We increased our operating margin by 2.3 points to 32.3% from a year ago. In terms of the bottom line, we grew non-GAAP EPS 5% to $0.60, while GAAP EPS was $0.50. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $68.0 billion, with $2.9 billion available in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned approximately $2 billion to our shareholders during the quarter that included $0.5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend, reflecting the 12% increase we announced last quarter. To summarize, Q3 was a solid quarter, and we executed well. We're focused on driving operational efficiencies and profitability, enabling us to make the strategic investments to drive long-term shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue in the range of minus 4% to minus 6% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.60 to $0.62. I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments. Thanks, Kelly, and thanks again to all of you for joining us today. As I mentioned earlier, we delivered another solid quarter, and we are executing well. We're confident in our strategy for long-term growth and profitability. We believe that the network will become increasingly important in solving our customers' most complex business problems and helping them get secure and stay secure. We also believe that we will continue to see strong momentum in our shift towards more software and subscription revenue. This reflects the success of the investments we are making in this area -- in these areas, together with the flexible consumption and buying models we're offering our customers. Marilyn, and I'll turn it back to you for questions. Great. Thanks, Chuck. Shaun, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)","Kelly, why don't you take him through the bridge, and then I'll just make some comments? Sure. So Mark, when we look at guidance, it's a combination of many factors, right? It starts with our backlog and then orders on them, the funnel. And then yes, definitely, we take into account our transition to more software and subscriptions and how that's impacting it. So when I look at the guidance we just gave, our orders were a little weaker in Q3, which does mean that I'm starting with the lower backlog than anticipated. And then when I'm assuming, when I look at the order strength, we're assuming what we saw in Q3 continues on in Q4. So just to give some color around that. Where we had -- we have been facing headwinds all quarter long with SP and emerging. We saw them get worse this quarter that you saw in the numbers there. I'm expecting that to continue. And then we saw some new kind of macro issues in the areas like Public Sector and the U.S. Fed space and things like that. So I'm assuming that orders in line that we saw in Q3 is going to continue on in Q4. And then finally, we are seeing an impact because you're seeing it go to the balance sheet of this transition that we are just accelerating through to the tune of 1.5 to 2 points. So the combination of those 3 things are driving the guidance into that minus-4 to minus-6 range. Yes, just -- Mark, a couple of comments on what Kelly just described. I mean, the Public Sector business, particularly in the United States, the federal business is, frankly, it's about 1 point of that guide. It's a pretty significant stall right now with the lack of budget visibility. And when you think about the strategy that we're deploying, the 57% growth in the software and subscription business, if you just go back 8 quarters ago, we had $2 billion on our balance sheet relative to software and subscription. And the first 2 or 3 quarters, we were convincing the teams that, that was the shift we were going to make. And now we have more than doubled that to $4.4 billion, and the growth there is accelerating. So we are very pleased with that transition. And at the same time we deal with all of these challenges, we're also, -- we remain very committed to earnings. We remain very committed to our capital return strategy. Thanks, Ittai. So Kelly, let's have the same strategy. You want to go through the math on this and then... So Ittai, when we look at the drivers of our growth margin, price in Q3 actually has been in the same range that it was pretty much last year as well as last quarter in terms of the price index that we're seeing. So that's in the same range. Again, it's high, but it's in the range. It's not increasing. I would say in terms of the guidance for Q4, we're assuming that. We are also making sure the teams are being very aggressive where they need to be aggressive in areas and then against competitors where we need to be. But overall, the pricing hasn't changed dramatically besides the normal erosion that we see in churned business lines. I'd say, in terms of mix, that hasn't dramatically changed as well, with switching being positive this quarter, that helped a lot. And again, well, the mix isn't changing. There's mix changes with [MBEs] in the guidance going forward but it's nothing dramatic. So I'd say we feel good about being able to continue driving the margins that we have. The only other piece I'll comment on, because we mentioned it before, we are still seeing some cost pressure from the increase in DRAM pricing that was got baked in both our Q3 as well as into Q4. But we've been doing a lot of work, and our supply chain team has done working with our suppliers to make sure we can secure our forward supply at prices that we can plan on. So I think we've pretty much got that boxed in for the guidance. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions to some of the comments that have already been made. Can you talk a little bit about the orders and you mentioned that fed was weak. But when you look at the other areas of weakness, can you talk about, like, what's driving those, et cetera? And I guess, more long term, it continues to be a good deferred revenue growth, and you mentioned the security. What are the priorities that your customers are showing in the security space generally? And what are you able to address now versus where are the things that they're asking for that you think you need to improve on? Great. Thanks, James. And so we have some order color and then securities. So let me take the order stuff, and then, Kelly, chime in as you'd like. So if we just go around -- sort of go around the globe, let me just highlight what we saw. And I'm just going to tell you what drove the weakness in these areas so you can assume the other pieces of the business were pretty much as expected. In the Americas, it was primarily the U.S. federal -- I mean, there's so much uncertainty around budgets. The U.S. federal business was a significant driver. Mexico, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Mexico, and that was actually down 49% for us year-over-year. So it was -- there's a great deal of uncertainty around the investment landscape there. And then the third element would have been the Service Provider business in the Americas. So those were the things that really drove the orders in the U.S. In Europe, the U.K., the currency issue in the U.K. is real and was very impactful in that business. And then we continue to see pressure in the Middle East relative to oil prices. We also -- obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty around the geopolitical dynamics, some of which have been clarified recently, obviously. And we did see some strength in some countries there, but the U.K. is a big country for us. And the Middle East, obviously, with the uncertainty around oil prices, continues to be a little bit of a pressure as well. In APJC, we saw Japan and Australia were reasonable. India was solid again. And China, we had tough comps from the SP Video business from a year ago that we talked about. So that's really what we saw from an orders perspective. I think if you look at customer segments, just to give you some color, Enterprise, the challenge was largely driven by Europe. Commercial, the lightness there was driven by Europe. Public Sector, as I said, was U.S. Federal, and SP was fairly consistent. So Kelly, any other comments on that? Yes. Just quickly on the securities, since you snuck that one in, too, James. The -- what our customers -- what we see happening in security right now is that as our customers prepare for the next few years and literally adding billions of new connections, we obviously believe that the network is going to become even more relevant than it ever has been. And our customers are going to need -- to deal with that scale, they're going to need significant automation. They're going to need greater insights coming out of their technology infrastructure like the network through analytics. They're going to need security embedded at the network layer because you're going to have to begin to secure the infrastructure the minute these packets hit the wire. So what they're looking for is -- they are looking for an end-to-end architecture now for dealing with security. They're looking for an open architecture that actually allows them to buy the best-of-breed technology, which we have across many elements of what they're trying to do. But they are looking for an architecture, and they're looking for -- to leverage as much of that from the cloud, and which correspondingly turns into the subscription business, as you pointed out. So that's what we see happening there. There's obviously lots of other areas within that architecture that we don't play today where we could, and we continue to assess all of those opportunities. So let me comment on the first one, and then, Kelly, maybe you can talk about the cloud business and how we -- I'll talk about both of them but then how we measure that specifically. So the weakness in emerging and SP, I would say, in emerging, I would say it's less. We clearly -- we've been -- we've had competition from several vendors. And clearly, Huawei is a very strong competitor. I don't feel like it has increased significantly in the emerging countries. It's been pretty consistent there, and our teams know how to compete, and we continue to evolve our strategy and bring different tools to help them compete. So I don't -- I wouldn't say that had much to do with it. I think on our overarching cloud business, Simona, we look at that in many, many different ways. So we look at, obviously, our private cloud business, which is made up of the UCS business as well as our data center switching portfolio, which we talked about earlier. Both of those, the UCS business was down 5, as you saw. And then the -- obviously, our next-generation switching portfolio continues to do well, the ACI elements up 42%. And if you're asking about the MSDC guys, which are the web scale cloud guys, it's the same as we were last quarter. These -- we have -- we're engaging with them on an individual basis. We look at the big ones as, frankly, markets of one. We have made great progress with a few of them. Others we're in the early stages, and we have codevelopment opportunities. But I would tell you, we're in very deep discussions with most all of them, and we're looking at very strategic partnerships that scale beyond even just selling infrastructure to them in many cases. So I'm not sure where you're going with cloud. Hopefully one of those answers cover what you're looking for. Kulbinder, could you just speak up just a hair, buddy? Yes, Kulbinder, I think that -- when we look to the future right now and you really think about the number of new connections that are going to be added, that our customers will be adding over the coming years and the need for automation, the need for analytics and security, what we have done, and it'll be done -- our solutions that we'll bringing in the space with a combination, to your point, of inorganic capabilities, as we have shown our ability to do, as well as some organic innovation. I've talked to several of you over the last few quarters about the fact that we went in and reallocated a fair amount of our R&D expense last year and over last 18 months. And many of those solutions are targeting these next-generation networks that our customers are going to need to build out to support this new infrastructure. And with a high degree of automation across the network, with a high degree of analytics, with distributed compute capabilities for processing the data at the Edge as well as the security piece. So we have future innovation that will come in that space. We'll also use a combination of inorganic options where we need it. And we believe that as we get into the next generation of the networks that the customers need to build out, that we will be very successful with our capabilities. I was hoping you could provide a little more detail regarding the order weakness you're flagging in the North American service provider vertical. Last quarter, if I remember correctly, you suggested orders there were improving a little bit. So I just want to understand the change. To what degree it's a technology issue versus a macro issue, the duration, you think, that's likely to be weak for and if there's if any areas within the vertical that are better or worse, that would be helpful. Let me just give you a couple of comments, and then Kelly can give us any specifics. As I said 2 quarters back, I think, when we had the negative 10% growth or 12% or whatever it was, 12%, I think. Yes, (inaudible). This -- Our entire SP business around the world is driven by very large customers. And so when some number of them have an off quarter, it can affect the business. And I think the Americas would be probably an example of that this quarter as well. And the Mexico business that I discussed is heavily influenced by service providers. And so that's a bit of what we've seen. We had some customers in the U.S. that were performed very well this quarter for us and others that did not. Kelly, any comment on the numbers? Yes. No, I'd say, I think you hit on it. I think with the Americas being down so much, it was a combination of Mexico. Again, these are big customers, and that was down. Chuck already mentioned Mexico was down 49%. It was a huge chunk of that was in the SP. And then in the U.S., the service providers, that was modestly down, not dramatic at all. Again, and that is, again, we had a lot of customers that were up and a lot that were down, so balanced overall. Yes, I'll make a comment and let Kelly answer the seasonality portion of it. But clearly, the transition to the software and subscription business obviously impacts how to think about guidance going forward. And when you -- when we see particularly large quarters with high growth like we saw this quarter, I think it will have an impact. I'm not sure exactly how we look at what it means seasonally. Kelly? Yes, I mean, I do think that the models that we've looked at, tried and true over the years, where we could look at normal sequential from Q3 and Q4, I think those models are changing because we are accelerating what is -- we're putting more on the balance sheet than what is amortizing off. While we are part of our revenue guide takes into account the growth of what's coming from our recurring offers, we're still adding so much more because we're adding more and more offers every day. So I do think it is changing a bit. I think we'll talk about this a bit more when we get to our Analyst conference in June as well. But we'll give you clarity of how we can continue to model that. We certainly saw the big chunk of our business that's driven by the core orders in the book and ship, because we still have a lot of our business that we haven't transitioned yet, but as we drive more and more of that, I do think it's going to have to change how we've modeled in the past as an analyst, right? And we'll give you the clarity to help that. Yes, I mean, again, Steve, that we -- because so much of our core business is still very much related to the orders that we have yet to book, our backlog accounts were less than 1/3. And so much of our quarter comes from the order yet to come. We don't give guidance by business unit. But directionally, I think you're thinking about it the right way, right? I mean, I think last quarter, we tried to guide, when we were talking about Routing. We knew we had strong orders a quarter ago in Routing, which is why it wasn't as bad as it had been in the quarter before this quarter on revenue. So again, it takes into account all of that. I do think, as you know, our Switching business is very fluid, so I don't think you should assume that, that is going to continue to be -- that goes up and down, so I don't think you should draw a trend having that being positive this quarter. So I think it's very fluid within business units. Sure. I'll hit the first one. So yes, if I break out the 31%, so the way to think about it, Rod, is basically, 90% of my services revenue is recurring, okay? So of the 31%, 75% of that dollar amount, so the $3.6 billion -- over $3.6 billion, 75% of that comes from the Services business. On the product side, 10% of my product revenue is now coming from recurring, so that's over $900 million. So 25% of that over $3.6 billion. And so again, I think that Services has continued to be in that 90% range. And again, what we're really trying to drive is more and more of those offers on the product side. Yes, and Rod, this is Chuck. Like 6 quarters ago, the product number, I think, was 6%, so we have made progress, and we'll continue to, as we see the amount of business that we're putting on the balance sheet is accelerating. On your second question, we absolutely continue to see the projects like Metro Optical moving forward. We've actually continued to do well in some of the next-generation areas that we're working with many of the U.S. service providers. So we see that going well, and we do believe that as they make some of these transitions, we are going to be right in the middle of them with them. Thanks, Vijay. Yes, it's -- your point is actually quite accurate that we look at how we use it -- both of those as tools across our entire portfolio. And I would tell you that there are initiatives underway and there are active solutions already in the marketplace that have elements of that. In our security portfolio, there are absolutely elements of the that, that are in our collaboration portfolio already. We see lots of opportunities when you start talking about automation and analytics and things like network assurance, capabilities or in service provider, self-healing networks. So we see the opportunity across everything we do, and we have initiatives both already working with customers as well as a lot of work going on inside the business units to leverage AI machine learning and other technologies going forward. Sure. So on the pricing, yes, just to give you the clarification of the pricing, and I'll pull up actually between Europe here, so just give me a second. But so to clarify, so we do have normal price erosion every period for, mostly, in our switching and routing portfolio, those are the ones that are most sensitive to it. It's been in the same consistent percentage in terms of price reduction year-over-year that it has been both last quarter, a year ago and so in the last -- we had one favorable quarter where we had some favorability for some rebates, but overall, it's been in the same range. But it hasn't gotten worse. I'll pull up about -- I'll try to pull up here as I'm answering the second question, any difference between Europe and the Americas. But I think it's fairly consistent across the regions. The second clarification was on -- what was it, Marilyn? The... On the impact of the recurring business. Yes. Yes, so I have been saying it's in the 1 to 2 range. It is definitely pushing closer to the 2% range at this point. I mean, I think, it's clearly driven. We share with you the balance and that's accelerating, and I certainly look at the short-term portion of that and try to quarterize that together with it. But it's definitely -- it's pointing to the 2% more than the 1%. And Paul, I'll get back to you on that -- if there's any difference between Americas and Europe on that. Yes, Tal, thanks for the question. So even in our current deferred revenue from Software and Subscription, there are elements of our core portfolio that are included in that $4.4 billion that you saw primarily through our Cisco ONE offerings that we put together. Probably 18 months ago, we started that journey and we got those offers and they began to ramp. But we also are looking -- obviously, security is ramping. Collaboration has been the one probably the longest in this model. But we do believe that across the portfolio, with future offers, we have the opportunity to do that, and you'll see that as we deliver on some of the new capabilities. Kelly, any commentary on the... Yes, on the slowdown, so Tal, we're actually not slowing down. The reason it looks like it's slowing down is for the Services piece, we do have the extra week compare. So if you adjust for that, it's up double digits in total. And if I look at just product, the growth of product, which I said is over $900 million, that's growing 34% year-over-year, and it was 30% last quarter. So that continues to grow faster. Yes, so first of all, I want to thank all of you for joining the call today. I wanted to just take a minute and reiterate that I believe that our strategy is working, and I'm really -- I'm optimistic about where we're going to go over the next 3 to 5 years. We set out 18 months ago to transition the business to one of more software and subscription. At the time, 8 quarters ago, it was $2 billion on our balance sheet. Today, we've more than doubled that, up 57% this quarter to $4.4 billion and accelerating. So I believe that is working, and we'll continue to shift more and more of our offers into that space. We also, obviously, wanted to be very clear about the areas that we needed to invest in, and you've seen significant investments in security and collaboration over the years. About 15 months ago, we made obvious reallocations of expenses more towards the core, and you're going to see future innovation in that space as well. Our customers really are going to be adding billions of connections in the future, and they are going to need a next-generation network with security automation and analytics. And so we're transitioning the business model. We're transitioning the network offers that we're going to deliver to our customers as they move into this next generation. And at the same time, we are leveraging our capability to do inorganic as well as organic innovation to make that happen. And in the midst of all this change, we remain very committed to our execution model and ensuring that we're focused on profitability as well as capital returns to our shareholders. So that's a summary of where I think we are right now, and I wanted to thank all of you for spending time with us today. Thanks.","I wanted to see if we could understand more of the guidance, Kelly and Chuck. The revenues are little lighter than we had anticipated. Is that a function of macro factors? Or is that a function more of the shift to the subscription model or maybe there's going to be some disturbance here and there. Clearly, the deferred revenue -- product revenue growth is quite nice, but I was just wondering if there's any sort of puts and takes you could walk us through there. I really appreciate it. Chuck, I'm going to take a U-turn this time, actually not ask you about the data center business but rather focus a little bit more on the gross margins. Some of the commentary in your press release talked about some pricing pressures. If you could give us a little bit more color on the guidance and your gross margin assumption into the guidance, how much of that is mix-related and how much of that is pricing?  And if -- any color you could give on the pricing, how much is competitive versus, I don't know, product shifts or something like that, that'll be great. It's Simona Jankowski. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, if you can clarify in terms of the weakness you saw incrementally in the Service Provider and emerging market theaters. How much of that was related to competition or pricing pressure such as from Huawei versus some of the macro factors you discussed? And then just a quick follow-up on how did your cloud business do this quarter. For Chuck maybe. On the revenue side, I take your points on the macro economy and the weakness in emerging markets. Sorry (foreign language) My question is on revenue growth, I think the drivers of the weak guidance you're talking about. I guess, the broader question is how important is getting this company back to growth? It looks like last year, you did grow. This year, you're probably not going to grow very much, i.e. especially organically. So is there something more transformative have to happen on the M&A front? Do you think this is temporary in nature? I know you're having this headwind of this business transformation, but just the importance of revenue growth to Cisco as a company, if you could comment on that for the long-term. I was wondering, Kelly and Chuck, if how much we should read in the weak guide you gave us against at least expectations we had on The Street. Is there a change we should expect in your seasonality pattern as you're going to watch more subscription services like natural, like trends of the first quarter that we've seen in the past? Is that something that we should see or we should expect to see changing over time? Kelly, can you give us any guidance by product segment for next quarter? For example, Services, I assume, will be up again. So in terms of kind of the deceleration of the downside, where will we see that? Will Switching likely be down, Routing be down more kind of in terms of things getting a bit worse? Where do you think we'll see that? I just wanted to see if you could comment a little bit on the 31% recurring revenue. Maybe help us understand how much of that is SMARTnet and maintenance-type services and how much is, let's call it, next-gen recurring revenue. And so that -- and I also would like it, if you could comment, I know the carrier situation in the U.S. is pretty weak, and we've seen that across other companies as well. But could you comment on specific projects like the Metro Optical buildout? Is that still a bright spot? Do you still see that project moving ahead as expected? I mean, Chuck, I'm just a research analyst. I've noticed you're using AI machine learning quite a bit more recently. So like to get your idea, Chuck, and also, Kelly, if you could, in terms of which might be the product areas within Cisco where you're apply AI machine learning to the max initially, where you see kind of low-hanging fruit, immediate kind of business outcomes from AI machine learning. Would it be in which parts of the portfolio? I'm hoping for a clarification on certain issues. One, going back to the earlier question on pricing. Kelly, did I hear you say that pricing was relatively stable? And can you give us some granularity in terms of what you're seeing in Europe Switching and Routing in terms of pricing? And just very quickly, 2 quarters ago, you quantified the impact of the shift to recurring revenue model. I think you'd cited 100- to 200-plus basis point adverse impact. Can you give us quantification of that impact this quarter? If my numbers are correct, your recurring revenues grew 6% year-over-year, and it was 14% the previous quarters. And I'm trying to see what could cause reacceleration. The question I have is whether you focus the recurring part mostly on new types of businesses, such as security and others, or you can find ways to go back to Switching and Routing and change either pricing scheme or add features or do something such that recurring revenues outside of maintenance, of course, recurring revenues grow, and you can add software features on top will do that. The question is whether the customers will accept it or is this is going to be a traditional business model forever? I believe that was our last question. Chuck, maybe I'll turn it to you for over for final words. Thanks, Chuck, and I'll go ahead and close it up here. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and annual results, will be on Wednesday, August 16, 2017, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Investor Relations Department here. And we thank you very much for joining today's call.

CSCO,Q1 2018,2327,3534,1167,"Thanks, Mark. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. As a reminder, effective in Q1, we began reporting our revenue in the following categories: Infrastructure platforms, Applications, Security, Other Products and Services. As discussed in our Q4 earnings call and in our October 23 press release, this change better aligns our product categories with our evolving business model. Our segments will continue to be based on geographies, which consists of the Americas, EMEA and APJC. So this change only impacts how we report revenue by product category. We've included quarterly reclassified revenue amounts for the last 3 fiscal years on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. Our results this quarter demonstrate the continued progress we're making on our strategic priorities. In Q1, we delivered a solid quarter with revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. We are seeing great traction with our new intent-based networking solutions, delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio and offering a broader range of new consumption options to our customers, resulting in strong increases in our software and subscription revenue. The progress we've made resulted in all 3 of our geographic regions returning to orders growth during Q1. Cisco has always been about connecting people, information and machines at scale. Today, the network is becoming more pervasive and critical to business success as billions of new connections are added. We expect these new connections will become increasingly automated, intelligent and secure, delivering unprecedented insights and intelligence to our customers. Cisco's vision is to deliver highly secure, intuitive technology across our portfolio that is designed to constantly learn, adapt and protect to drive business outcomes with greater speed and agility. This extends to the network, next-generation data center architectures, advanced IoT applications, end-to-end analytics and our collaboration technologies. Our vision is resonating with customers and partners around the world as we help them build more secure, intelligent platforms for their digital businesses. Today, most of our customers are operating in complex, multi-cloud environments, and Cisco is well-positioned to provide them with networking capabilities, enterprise-class security and support, together with cloud scale, agility and economics. Our new partnership with Google is a good example of this. Over the last few months, our engineering teams have been working closely together to jointly develop a new hybrid cloud solution that is designed to enable applications and services to be deployed, managed and secured across on-premise environments as well as the Google Cloud Platform, bringing the best of cloud to the enterprise. This partnership is an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web scale providers. We are also investing to develop and acquire new technologies to extend our multi-cloud portfolio. This includes ACI Anywhere, which we announced this quarter; and acquisitions such as CliQr, OpenDNS, CloudLock, AppDynamics and Viptela. Now I'd like to cover some key business highlights in our new product reporting categories. First, let's start with Infrastructure Platforms. Our launch of the network intuitive in June is an example of the investment and innovation we're driving in our core business. These new intent-based networking capabilities are providing customers unparalleled insights and intelligence, together with highly differentiated security and programmability. Our new subscription-based Catalyst 9000 Switching platform has been adopted by more than 1,100 customers in just over 3 months. We expect continued momentum throughout fiscal 2018, and we're pleased that the vast majority of Catalyst 9000 customers are buying our most advanced software subscription offer. Additionally, we saw good performance in our next-generation data center switching platforms, as customers continue to shift to 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig architectures and embrace multi-cloud adoption. We continue to advance our intent-based networking for data center and private cloud environments with the latest software release of ACI. Over 4,000 ACI customers are benefiting from increased business agility with network automation, simplified management and improved security. Going forward, we see a tremendous opportunity to benefit from a shift in customer demand from standalone products to integrated platforms with our intent-based infrastructure portfolio providing unmatched benefits. Now turning to Applications. Applications are absolutely essential to every digital business strategy. To maximize their effectiveness, companies require a highly secure network that closely monitors applications and workload performance across a complex multi-cloud environment. Our acquisition of AppDynamics is core to our capability of providing end-to-end analytics from the network to the data center to the application. Within our Applications business, we are enabling new capabilities based on advanced AI and machine learning across our portfolio. An example of this is our acquisition of Perspica, providing deep machine learning, driven analytics to further extend AppDynamics' leading capabilities in application intelligence. Additionally, we announced our latest innovation on the Cisco Spark platform, Spark Assistant, which is the world's first enterprise-ready, AI-powered voice assistant to further enhance our customers' meeting experience. Our intended acquisition of BroadSoft will enhance our subscription and cloud-based business. BroadSoft has 19 million subscribers in the growing cloud voice and contact center space and will enable Cisco to offer an even broader portfolio of collaboration solutions to our customers, on-premise and in the cloud. We expect this acquisition to accelerate the pace of innovation in our collaboration business, and we see many opportunities to extend the reach of the BroadSoft portfolio. Moving to Security. With an expanding threat landscape, cybersecurity is the #1 priority for businesses worldwide and is at the heart of every company's digital strategy. In a multi-cloud world, as our customers' environments become increasingly distributed, security requirements only increase. At Cisco, security continues to be a strategic imperative and fundamental to everything we do. As customers adopt and advance intent-based networking, our end-to-end security is the foundation to keep our customers protected from advanced threats. This architecture, combined with the best-of-breed portfolio across the network, endpoint and cloud, enables our customers to reduce the time to detection as well as complexity and cost. As a result, we believe Cisco is delivering the most effective and comprehensive security solutions in the market. This differentiated strategy drove the 8% revenue growth in our Security portfolio, and we also saw continued momentum in our Security deferred revenue with 42% growth. To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities. I firmly believe that Cisco is well positioned to capture long-term growth opportunities ahead. We remain focused on providing our customers with the most innovative portfolio of offerings in the industry, powered by intent-based capabilities and delivered through a range of consumption models, providing more flexibility than ever before. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the Q2 outlook. Total revenue was $12.1 billion, down 2%. We continue to focus on driving margins and profitability with non-GAAP operating margin of 30.4%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, and operating cash flow was strong, growing 13% to $3.1 billion. The rule of enterprise IT is dramatically changing with the move to an application-centric focus and adoption of hybrid cloud architectures, with customers increasingly seeing the value of integrated platforms over standalone products. Cisco's intent-driven architecture with a focus on simplicity, automation and security allows enterprises to manage and govern the interactions of users, devices and applications across the environment. Starting in Q1, to better reflect this shift, we've changed our product reporting categories, which are now Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, Other Products and Services. So let me give you a little bit more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was down 3%. Infrastructure Platforms declined 4%, with the vast majority of the decline driven by routing products. This was driven by continued weakness in Service Provider and a slowdown in enterprise routing. Our Switching revenue was down modestly, but we saw good momentum on orders and Campus Switching with the network intuitive launch. Additionally, we did see continued strong wireless revenue performance and solid uptake of our HyperFlex data center offering. Let's move on to Applications. To remind you, applications is made up our collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications, conferencing and TelePresence as well as our IoT and application software businesses such as AppDynamics and Jasper. Applications increased 6% in total, with collaboration up modestly and AppDynamics driving most of the increase. We did see strong growth in deferred revenue of 18%. There was also a strong increase in the unbilled deferred, which is not on the balance sheet, bringing the combined total of deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred up 32%. Security was up 8%, with strong performance in unified threat, advanced threat and web security, and deferred revenue grew 42% as we continue to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 1%, driven by growth in software and solution services. During the quarter, we introduced a new portfolio of subscription offers called Business Critical and High-value Services, powered by AI to predict future IT failures before they happen. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 10% in total, with product up 16% and services up 5%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was up 37% to $5.2 billion. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions in recurring revenue. In Q1, we generated 32% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of over 3 points from a year ago. Revenue from software subscriptions was 52% of our software revenue. In terms of orders in Q1, total products orders grew 1%. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 1%, EMEA was up 2% and APJC grew 1%. Total emerging markets declined 6%, with the BRICs plus Mexico also down 9%. In our customer segments, enterprise declined 5%, commercial grew 12%, public sector was up 3% and service provider declined 6%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 growth margin was 63.7%, down 1.5 points; product gross margin was 63.0%, down 1.8 points; and service gross margin was 65.6%, down 0.6 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by higher memory pricing, like we've discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was 30.4%, down 1.2 points. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there has been a 60 basis point positive impact on revenue, no impact on gross margin, a 3-point increase on non-GAAP operating expenses, all resulting in a negative 70 basis points impact on our non-GAAP operating margin rate and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our GAAP EPS. In terms of the bottom line, our Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, while GAAP EPS was $0.48. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $71.6 billion, with $2.5 billion available in the U.S. Q1 operating cash flow had very strong growth of 13% to $3.1 billion. And free cash flow was also very strong with growth of 19% to $2.9 billion. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $1.6 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, in Q1, we continued to make progress on our strategic growth priorities while maintaining rigorous discipline on profitability and cash generation. We continue to prioritize our key investments to drive long-term profitable growth. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year '18. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. And also, as Chuck mentioned, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire BroadSoft. The acquisition is expected to close after completion of the customary regulatory reviews, and therefore, it is not included in the guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. And the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Mark, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)","Yes. Thanks, Pierre. Great question. Yes, so the vast majority of the impact on our gross margin is driven by memory. It is basically 1.3 points of my product gross margin decline year-over-year. Everything else in our gross margin is basically in the normal ranges. So we expect that to continue. When you look at the guidance, we did bring it down 0.5 point to account for that because we are still seeing increases as we look forward -- moving forward. But otherwise, we kind of see everything else in the normal range of things. Chuck, you talked about 1,100 customers have already adopted the intuitive network. I just want to get a sense in terms of how does that underpin, longer term, the steady-state growth? You guys guided to about 1% to 3% growth for the current quarter. But as more and more of those customers adopt and they move beyond the labs and move beyond the proof-of-concept, can we actually see your growth tick higher than 1% to 3% on a steady-state? Yes, Mark. Thanks for the question. So clearly, we're pleased with where we're going right now with this product portfolio. We're pleased with the early feedback. I'll tell you that our sales teams, our partners and our customers, are very excited about the architecture that we've announced. It's still one quarter, so we have to get a little more time under our belt. But what I will tell you is that when we look back at a transition like the 3850 years and years ago, it's very much in line. And I think that as more customers have the opportunity to test the automation and programmability and all those software features that they're testing right now, we would hope that the platform continues to accelerate. So one quarter down, but we feel good about where we are. Well, thanks, Steve. So what I said in the script is that a vast majority of our customers that are buying these platforms are opting for the advanced. And I would say that it's a vast majority. We knew when we introduced a subscription on a switch that we needed to ensure that there was unique innovation that was available to our customers in order for them to see value in that. We couldn't just simply shift the capabilities that they had gotten before in a perpetual model. We needed to drive new innovation. So the anchors that are in that advanced subscription are the overall automation capability, which really gets at the OpEx of running these networks; and the second part is the Encrypted Traffic Analytics, where we can determine when there's malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it. And we think that those 2 are phenomenal incremental capabilities that our customers didn't have before, and I think that's why we're seeing such a high attach rate. So we're very pleased with where we are on that as well. Vijay, thanks for the question. We've been talking about this for several calls now, about how we've reengaged with the large web scale providers back -- right after I became CEO, and these are long processes as they made major architectural decisions and they have franchises that you're trying to reenter. But if you look at whether it's the announcements we've made with Microsoft a couple of quarters ago, the announcement we made with Google, you alluded to Alibaba, which there's a summary of that win on our website, if you want to go see that. It's our first insertion there. And actually, it was before the large sales day they experienced, I think, last week. And so we continue to make progress, and we're continuing to execute on what I told you that we're executing on over the last 1.5 years, which is trying to go deeper. I think the other thing that has become eminently clear is that these large web scale providers realize that it is going to be a multi-cloud world, and they definitely have come to the conclusion that the Edge is going to be mission-critical for our customers going forward. And as I think about that, we're a very natural -- we're the very natural partner for them to partner with as the network is the only common denominator across all these cloud environments all the way out to the edge of our enterprise customers' networks. So we're just continuing to execute against what we set out 2 years ago, and we hope to continue to seek success. Yes. So Paul, yes, I mean, obviously, we're trying to go to new groupings. But just to give you some color. I mean, we continue to see the double-digit growth that we've been talking about of our ACI portfolio, continue in the strong double digits. And overall, data center was certainly up from a revenue perspective. And I think, Paul, from a perspective of the web scale, I mean, it's really just what I described. We're in discussions with all of them. We have made announcements with several of them, and we continue to execute against our strategy. And again, it's -- these are large franchises. There's 2 facets. And if you remember on a call back -- 2 or 3 calls back, I said that we're now expanding our discussions into 360-degree relationship discussions. The Google announcement was reflective of that comment because not only are we working on their infrastructure, but we're also working significantly on this multi-cloud enablement, hybrid cloud enablement and helping bridge our customers -- their premise-based solutions, their Edge-based solutions, their cloud applications, their SaaS applications. And so we just -- we're continuing to execute on that right now. Kelly, you want to... Yes, I'll just hit the Cisco ONE. Cisco ONE continues to have great momentum. We're over 22,000 customers at this point with that. So still great momentum. Yes, Ittai, just -- so thanks for your comments, by the way. On the hyperconverged offer or HyperFlex offer, I would tell you that it has continued to probably be at the high-end of my expectations. I'd say a couple of quarters ago, it began to exceed what I was expecting, so I changed my expectations. And it's -- but they're doing a great job. The teams are doing well. I think we know the use cases where it's very competitive, and I think that it continues to -- they continue to operate at the high end of what I expected from them.  So we're very pleased with that. On the question relative to SD-WAN, I think you nailed it, right. The -- our customers, and we've talked about this for a couple of calls, our customers have been trying to assess what this SD-WAN architectural transition looks like. And I think that after we acquired Viptela, we have now, at our sales meeting, we provided tremendous clarity to our sales organization and our partner community at the Partner Summit about what our strategy is. We've now taken customers through the road maps of what they can expect and then -- and how to position the different alternatives that we have and how those portfolios are going to come together over the next 12 to 18 months. So I think that it is a by-product of the SD-WAN discussion. And I would expect that we'll start to see customers move somewhat this quarter. And then in the second half of the year, I think our customers will continue to begin to deploy some of these solutions. So again, happy with where we are relative to the positioning of the different platforms. Yes, George, thanks for the question. Yes, right now, we're still seeing it around that 2% range. We expect the headwind to grow once the -- once we continue to grow the intuitive network that has a subscription. As that grows, that'll grow. But right now, it's in that 2% range, 1.5% to 2% range. And we expect that to be roughly in that range next quarter as well. Yes. So Tal, thanks for the question. Let me break it down. So the advanced subscription today is primarily being sold on the new Catalyst 9000, even though it's backwards compatible with a couple of years worth of our, I don't know, 2, 3 years' worth of products that we've shipped in wireless and in routing, et cetera. But what the customers are doing right now is they're basically becoming accustomed to the platform. They're testing the platform before they make an investment on any sort of backwards compatibility is what I would tell you. I don't think we need to make any changes right now because the attach rate of the most advanced subscription offer is at the very high end of what I would've expected. So I think we're very pleased with where it is right now. And assuming we execute on the value and the innovation that our customers continue to gain from that, then I think that we'll begin to see them then buy the subscriptions on some of their installed base as well. That would be our intent. And just to add to that, I mean, just to be clear, 100% of the switches we're selling come with a subscription. It's just a difference on what additional features and security are added between the Advantage and the Essentials. So 100% of the new switches are sold with a subscription, and that's going well. Thanks, Mitch. So I think that the thing that is resonating with the customer is if you look at the environments that they're all beginning to operate in, they're operating in an environment where they have multiple SaaS providers, multiple cloud providers. They've got their private data centers with applications running. They've got their branch networks. They've got now Edge connectivity with IoT coming in. And so the robustness of an architecture that they have to have that protects across the network, across the endpoint, across the cloud is really what, I think, is differentiating it. And we've also -- we've been on a multi-year journey of selling software and subscriptions against the threat intelligence and the malware intelligence that we have, and I think that's what's continuing to pay off. So I think it's resonating with our customers, and it's an architecture that we can continue to innovate on. We continue to expand on. And Kelly, any comments on the... Yes. I mean, I'd just say advanced threat and unified threat as well as even web security, they're all up big double digits. I mean, just really strong growth. I wanted to ask a question on capital structure. Can you give us an idea of what your preference is and priorities will be in capital structure in terms of buybacks and acquisitions, et cetera, if the proposed new tax changes pass versus if that change in tax law gets derailed? I'm particularly curious as to how you're thinking about the pacing of acquisitions versus buybacks, et cetera. Yes, I'll take that one. What I'd say is in terms of acquisitions, the tax policy isn't impacting us either way because we are lucky to have a great cash flow and access to capital. So it hasn't been stopping us from anything from an acquisition perspective, and it won't. So that will continue. I would say we're definitely encouraged by the progress that's going on in the tax reform. So like  we said in the past, when that happens and if we get a repatriation, which most plans currently have, we're going to continue, like we have, growing our dividend with our earnings growth. And where we have opportunity is really to get much more aggressive than we have been on the share buyback. And of course, we want to make sure we continue to have enough firepower to continue to able to do the right acquisitions to help us position Cisco right for the long term. Kelly, you want to... Yes, sure. I mean, I'll give you some color. I'd say, it's a combination of things, right? I mean, if I go to the amount of revenue coming off the balance sheet from the progress we've been steadily making on growing our software and subscriptions, it's now up to 12% of our product revenue is now coming from recurring offers and off the balance sheet. So that's helping. I would say also, the launch that we had on the intuitive network and the excitement around the reinvention of the core is having an impact. So we're encouraged. And you heard me mention, we're seeing positive demand on [man or wan] Campus Switching overall, which is great, and that has a big impact because it's one of the biggest pieces of our portfolio. So that, combined with pretty good orders like we had in Q1, gives us a very good backlog position that allows us to have a good view into what the next quarter looks like. So I'd say, overall, the overall strategy, what we've been executing and talking about for the last couple of years here is we've been making progress, and all of this is benefiting us in the outlook. James, just to clarify one point or just to add to it, actually, when Kelly says 12% of our product revenue is coming from recurring offers, just to put that in perspective, when I became CEO, it was 6%. So we've effectively doubled that. And I think that's certainly helpful. And just we have seen -- we're seeing positive feedback on the launch. So I'm sorry that was Simon. I apologize, Simon. Jeff? In the enterprise switches? Yes, enterprise. Yes. So thanks for the question, Jeff. I think that if you look at some of the performance we saw around the world, to your point, in Europe and Asia, we've talked about Huawei's activity over the last couple of quarters. I would say that our teams have been very focused on it. I think that the intuitive network launch that we did in June really changes the discussion. And where we compete with competitors who their value prop is upfront cost of the hardware, I think we're changing the discussion, because if you look at the cost of operating this infrastructure over a 5-year period, it's probably 10x the cost of the upfront hardware. So going and helping our customers really reduced that is a value proposition that helps us change the discussion relative to the competition. So they continue to be very tough, but we think that competing on the price of the box upfront is something that we can shift over the next couple of years. Yes, Erik, thanks for that. So at our financial analyst conference this summer, we articulated a long-range guide in line with what you just described. We're going to have quarters that are going to be -- that are going to vary from that. But that's definitely our long-term objective. And I think our teams are focused now on what is it we need to do for the next wave of this architecture. Once we have this architecture built, where we can actually defend and apply real-time defense against known threats, we can learn about a threat through malware and e-mail, and we can protect against it in the network and the cloud and the devices at the endpoint all at the same time. So the teams are working hard to continue to drive innovation there, but also looking at what other elements can we fit into this architecture over time. And I think that's how we think about the long-term guide. It's Jim Suva from Citi. On your guidance of up 1 to 3, as talked about earlier, it's the first time you guys have seen year-over-year revenue growth for quite a long time. Kelly and Chuck, you've mentioned strength in orders and also the subscription model taking traction. Are we now at a point where a shift to subscription is no longer dragging down year-over-year comps? Or that still a bit of a challenge in the orders that Chuck mentioned are just so much stronger? And Chuck, any end market areas we should think about for that order strength? Yes, I'll take the first part. I'd say no. We're still, I'd say, growing the base of the offers faster and putting it on the balance sheet than it's coming off. But again, both the year-over-year increase of the balance of $5.2 billion was up 37%, and my income statement was up 37% as well. But I'm still putting more and more offers. And as we get scale through the core networking, not just on Switching but the whole DNA Center, I think that'll continue to add. So it's still going to be a headwind. And as I said before, this 1.5 to 2 points will move to more like a 2 to 3 points in the upcoming years as we get more scale there. So more to come, but again, we're benefiting from -- we're starting to see the benefit of just having more stability and being able to have a better line of sight and less massive fluctuation by having that. And Jim, just a market segment perspective that it's probably pretty clear. We saw service provider pretty much the same as it has been for some period of time. Our largest enterprise customers, which the way we define it, is really just an organizational segment that we have, we did see -- we saw negative mid-single digits there, which you saw on the slides. In our commercial business, we saw 12% growth on a global basis, and it was double digits in every geography, which is always good to see. Our enterprise customers, what I would tell you is that they are -- they're some of the biggest customers who take the longest amount of time to evaluate new platforms and new capabilities like the network intuitive as well as this whole SD-WAN discussion. So we're actively in those discussions with the enterprise customers. And our commercial customers tend to just move more quickly than others. And then finally, on the Public Sector side, which we didn't talk about a lot, I think, the big call-out there, I would say, is that 2 quarters ago, we talked about the pressure in the Federal, business. Last quarter, we said we saw it improving. And what I would tell you is that in this quarter, we saw the year end that was -- that seemed fairly normal. While they still have a lot of leadership roles that haven't been filled and we still have the impending December debt ceiling issue, overall, for this quarter, we saw the federal business pretty much back to what we expected as we closed the quarter. So that's probably commentary I can provide on the market segments. Okay. I think we are... Well, that's it, isn't it? Yes. We're going to wrap up. Okay. I'll wrap it. Thanks, everyone, again for joining us today. I want to -- I just want to wrap with a few points. First off, we are committed to executing on this vision to deliver a highly secure, intelligent platform for our customers' digital business. And we are laser focused on 5 key elements of that strategy to enable our customer success and drive profitable growth for us and shareholder value as well. First, we are fundamentally reinventing networking with our intent-based networking platform. We intend to further accelerate our leadership here, extending intuitive technologies across the broad portfolio that we have while increasing application visibility and automation. Secondly, security is fundamental to everything we do. You can't build a next-generation digital business without a comprehensive security strategy across endpoints, network and the cloud. Third, it is very clear that it's a multi-cloud world, and Cisco is in a unique position to help our customers navigate this by expanding our multi-cloud portfolio and extending our web scale partnerships with strategic cloud providers. Our Google partnership's an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web scale providers. Fourth, we're unlocking the power of the data with advanced analytics such as our solutions with AppDynamics, Encrypted Traffic Analytics and TELUS threat intelligence. We are also embedding AI and machine learning technologies across the breadth of our portfolio. And lastly, we will continue to deliver a more enhanced customer and employee experience through our broad collaboration portfolio, including our intent to acquire BroadSoft. Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2018 second quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations Department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.","Kelly, I can't help asking you an update on gross margin movements. So can you give us a bit of a sense of how big is memory prices in the 1.5 points gross margin declines that you've seen year-on-year? And then sequentially, your guide for gross margin in -- for Q2 was slightly below what you've been guiding for Q1. Is there still like incremental headwind coming from compound pricing hurting you from the Q1 to Q2? To continue along those lines, Chuck, you talked a little bit about the software attach rates. Could you elaborate on that? And particularly the advantage premium, which, I think, has the encryption capability and so forth? Exactly what sort of mix are you seeing? And do you think that customers are going to be willing to pay up for the premium? Yes, my question for you, Chuck, and Kelly, please join in, is has anything changed in your sales motion in terms of data center switching? And the reason I ask is we are starting to see this positive news flow, Alibaba cloud recently and, perhaps here in Microsoft as well. What has changed in your view, Chuck, in terms of the sales motion? Is it the clouds paying attention to things like software automation tools, security? Anything else? Or is it just a sales focus on cloud? Help us understand. Chuck and Kelly, recognize you guys are no longer breaking it out, but I'm hoping that you'll throw us a bone and put numbers on the data center switching revenue growth, given how important it is and how stronger growth market that's been. And as part of that, Chuck, related to the previous question, can you give us any quantification of your progress with the Web 2.0 hyperscale customer segment, given the importance of that segment? Nice to see growth on the guide. I had a couple of things. First of all, for you, Kelly, can you update us on the number of Cisco ONE customers? Just as a housekeeping. And then for you, Chuck, getting a little bit deeper into the infrastructure part of the business. Great color there on the product lines, but maybe you can help us fine tune a couple of things. One, on the hyperconverged, I think Kelly actually mentioned that you were off to a good start there. But maybe you can help us understand where you stand on that product line, how good you feel about the platform, how stable it is. And then the weakness in the enterprise routing, I'm just trying to understand how much of it is a secular issue, meaning SD-WAN is starting to make an impact there versus an execution or seasonal element. Is this going to be another part of your business that's just going to be under pressure for a long time as routing has been? I guess, I was curious about the revenue headwind associated with the move to a subscription model, including Cisco ONE. Can you remind us what you wound up seeing in terms of the headwind in the October quarter, and then also, what you're assuming for January? My question is almost a follow-up to the previous question. Can you elaborate? I know you started at the beginning of the year to do the Subscription for Switching. Can you elaborate on, first of all, the experience you've had so far, cases where customers took the subscription versus didn't take? What does it include? Just elaborate on the subscription and kind of the profile of it and also the take rate so far and whether you need to make any changes to it in order to improve take rates, et cetera. I'm just trying to understand the implications for future years. I wanted to focus on the Security angle. So despite having pretty difficult comparisons last year, still up 8%, so can you maybe provide some color what's going well there? And then secondly, any sort of growth rates or rough numbers with the advanced threat versus web security growth rates? I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more insight into what you would attribute the outlook to in terms of this is the first quarter with year-over-year growth we've seen in quite some time. So I'm wondering, if we attribute it to an easy comparison or lapping the buildup of deferred revenue or some specific product cycles, if you could help us assess the key elements bringing you back to year-over-year growth. Oh, sorry. I'm on mute. Pardon me. Yes, I was hoping to ask about competition in the Enterprise Switching space. And we've seen a little bit more out of Huawei perhaps, not in the U.S., of course, but international. I'm wondering if you could put some of that color into context for us, both from them and also from some of your traditional rivals. It was good to see Security picking up. What are your expectations for Security growth? In the past, you've talked about driving double-digit growth on the Security side. Is that still a goal? And where do you think you are in terms of getting there?

This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a very strong finish to a great year. We generated our highest quarterly revenue of $12.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70, as growth accelerated for another consecutive quarter. Our momentum was broad-based across our portfolio, customer segments and geographies. We also continued to generate solid margins, cash flow and returns for our shareholders. Our results demonstrate a combination of strong customer adoption of our latest innovations, the ongoing value customers see in our software and subscription offerings and excellent execution across our customer segments and geographies. Our strategy is working, and we believe that we are well-positioned to capture growth across the portfolio with our pipeline of innovation. The broad adoption of multi-cloud environments is changing the very nature of how modern IT infrastructures are built and secured, and Cisco is at the center of this transition. The recently announced intent to acquire Duo Security is another example of how we are extending our intent-based networking portfolio for the multi-cloud world. Duo's SaaS-delivered solution will expand our cloud security capabilities to help enable any user on any device to securely connect to any application on any network. Combining Cisco's network, endpoint and cloud security platform with Duo's zero-trust authentication and access solutions, we will be able to further enhance the industry's broadest and most effective security architecture in the market. Now I'll briefly highlight some of our innovation and the great momentum we're seeing across our key product areas. Starting with Infrastructure Platforms. We continue to rapidly innovate and transform our technology portfolio to drive even greater customer value. A year ago, we reinvented Enterprise Networking with the launch of our intent-based networking architecture. This quarter, we saw continued strength in Infrastructure Platforms, driven by the Catalyst 9000, as customers look to us to simplify and automate their networks. Over the last year, we introduced additional innovations across our networking portfolio, including new access, WAN and data center offerings. In June, we announced new developer capabilities across our intent-based networking portfolio, spanning all network domains: Campus switching, wireless, WAN, data center and cloud. We're also excited that our developer program, DevNet, surpassed 500,000 registered members. As part of this program, we introduced new offerings to help developers and network engineers innovate throughout our intent-based architecture. As we all know, the WAN is undergoing an architectural transition to a software-defined WAN to enable IT to rapidly respond to changing business needs in a digital and cloud world. Our customers are driving this transition and looking to Cisco to help them make this shift. Our SD-WAN portfolio leverages our leading networking products, automation and robust security architecture to enable greater flexibility, increased bandwidth and lower costs. This quarter, we saw significant traction with Viptela, as it has now been deployed at over 800 customers, driven by our ability to provide higher capacity at a lower cost. We are pleased with the ongoing integration of Viptela with our core portfolio to drive even more value for our customers. As our customers move to a multi-cloud environment, we see tremendous opportunities to provide value to them by redesigning their IT architecture, delivering security and building, orchestrating and managing applications. In Q4, we saw the production launch of our hybrid cloud solution with Google, the introduction of a multi-cloud solution with NetApp and numerous engagements with customers redesigning their IT architectures. We continue to believe Cisco is very well-positioned to benefit from the increasing adoption of multi-cloud. Turning to security. Security continues to be our customers' #1 concern and it is a top priority for us. Our strategy is to simplify and increase security efficacy through an architectural approach, with products that work together and share analytics and actionable threat intelligence. This architecture is supported by Talos, one of the largest commercial threat intelligence teams in the world. We identify and protect against new and emerging threats, like the recent VPN filter vulnerability, through our sophisticated infrastructure and unrivaled telemetry of data. Cisco is the largest network and enterprise security company, and our approach of bringing security into the intent-based architecture and offering security across the network, endpoint and cloud has proven to be very successful. This quarter, we saw continued strong momentum with revenue again accelerating and growing double digits year-over-year. We continue to invest in our product and technology innovation as we are committed to helping our customers on their multi-cloud journey. Our focus is on delivering cloud security solutions that provide ease-of-use, scalability and protect end users. As I mentioned earlier, with our acquisition of Duo Security, we will further enhance how we deliver simple, automated, trusted access anywhere for our customers' environments. Moving to applications. In May, we announced the launch of WebEx Teams, bringing together meetings, calling and teamwork into an integrated experience as part of the WebEx platform. In Q4, we introduced major new enhancements to the platform, including a new user design for WebEx Meetings and a new solution with Google, combining their contact center AI service with the WebEx platform. With more than 3 million customer service agents globally using Cisco's contact center software, our integration with Google will help to automate responses in our call centers by leveraging data and intelligence from AI. We also achieved another robust quarter of growth with AppDynamics, underscoring the importance and value of our unique end-to-end visibility and analytics from the end user to the network to the application. To wrap up, 2018 was a great year. We returned to growth, invested in our core franchises, delivered new innovative platforms and continued to shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Our record results demonstrate the strength of our business as well as the strategic focus and execution that we have delivered over the past 12 months. I want to thank our teams around the globe for delivering these results. We are looking forward to fiscal year '19 with a clear focus on growth, execution and innovation. We see incredible opportunities across our business and believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver on our vision to be one of the most strategic partners to our customers as they go through their digital transformation. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full fiscal year and the Q1 outlook. Q4 was a solid quarter across the business. We executed well with strong orders, revenue growth, margins, EPS and operating cash flow. It was great to see accelerated momentum in product orders, which grew 7%. Total revenue was $12.8 billion, up 6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 30.9%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.3 billion, up 8%. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.70, up 15%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7%, with broad strength across the portfolio. Infrastructure Platforms grew 7%, with growth in all businesses except for routing, which was down slightly. Switching had another great quarter with strong growth in campus, driven by the ramp of the Cat 9K and growth in data center driven by the Nexus 9K. We saw good growth in wireless with strength in Meraki and our Wave 2 offerings. Data center had very strong double-digit growth driven by servers and HyperFlex. Routing declined slightly driven by weakness in SP routing. Applications was up 10% in total with growth across all the businesses. We saw very solid growth in Unified Communications, TelePresence, conferencing and AppDynamics. Security was up 12%, with strong performance in network security, unified threat, policy and access and web security. Service revenue was up 3%, driven by growth in advanced services as well as Software and Solution Support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q4, recurring revenue was 32% of total revenue, an increase of 1 point from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 56% of our total software revenue, up 5 points year-over-year. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 6% in total, with product up 15% and services up 1%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was $6.1 billion, up 23%. There was also a strong increase in the unbilled deferred, which is not on the balance sheet. The combined total deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred was up 28%. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year-over-year, there was a 90 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw especially strong momentum in Q4 with total product orders growing 7%. Looking at our geographies. Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was up 12%. Total emerging markets was up 12%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 22%. In our customer segments, enterprise was up 11%; commercial was up 9%; public sector was up 1%; and service provider returned to growth, up 6%. Our product backlog at the end of Q4 was $6.6 billion, up 38% year-over-year. From a non-GAAP gross margin perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 62.9%, down 0.8 points. Product gross margin was 61.5%, down 0.4 points. And service gross margin was 67.1%, down 1.7 points. Product gross margin was down 0.4 points, driven by our APJC region related to some SP-specific deals as well as negative product mix. Product gross margin for the Americas and EMEA were both up year-over-year. Overall, pricing continued to have relatively modest erosion, as we have seen over the past couple of quarters, and we continue to be negatively impacted by higher component costs, which we expect to continue in the near term. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q4 net income was $3.8 billion and EPS was $0.81. The GAAP results include an $863 million benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We've excluded the benefit from our non-GAAP results. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $46.5 billion. Q4 operating cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 2%, with free cash flow of $3.9 billion, also up 2%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $7.5 billion to our shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $6 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. I'll now cover the full fiscal year. We delivered solid revenue, margins, net income, EPS and operating cash flows. Revenue was $49.3 billion, up 3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 31.1%. Non-GAAP net income was $12.7 billion, up 5%. And non-GAAP EPS was $2.60, up 9%. Our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.8%, a decrease of 0.5 points, with product gross margin down 0.4 points and service gross margin down 0.9 points. GAAP net income was $110 million, and GAAP EPS was $0.02, which includes the charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $10.4 billion. For the full fiscal year, we delivered operating cash flow of $13.7 billion. We paid approximately $1.4 billion of onetime foreign taxes during the year related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Operating cash flow increased 8%, normalized for these tax payments. We returned $23.6 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represented 184% of our free cash flow that was made up of $17.7 billion of share repurchases and $6 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we had a strong Q4 and fiscal year. We executed well with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. As a reminder, we are adopting the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, as of Q1 fiscal year '19 on a modified retrospective basis. Its primary impact will be to accelerate our revenue recognition for certain software licenses and sales to 2-tier distributors as well as the recognition of a deferred commissions asset that will be amortized over the terms of our sales contracts. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year '19. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7% year-over-year. This range includes the impact of ASC 606, which we estimate to be a benefit of about 1%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.70 to $0.72. The guidance includes our Service Provider Video Software Solutions business that we recently agreed to sell and excludes the Duo acquisition, since both transactions have not closed. We expect the SPVSS transaction to close in the first half of fiscal '19, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions) I'll now turn it over to Michelle.","Thanks, Vijay. So most of you know that we -- when we began the sell of the Catalyst 9000, that was the first attempt to sell a subscription software offering on top of a core networking product. And that has gone, as we've said on prior calls, reasonably well. I'm very pleased with how the adoption has been from our customers. They understand the value. As I said early on, we put -- we knew when we started that process that we would need to deliver significant innovation that wasn't available in the traditional methodology of buying it in order for our customers to adopt it. And some of those were the Encrypted Traffic Analytics, the overarching analytic -- I mean, the automation capability and then recently, some Assurance. And you'll see us over the next coming quarters, when we bring new products to market in the -- particularly in the enterprise networking space, but across the portfolio, we will apply that same strategy. So I think that we've been pleased. And our job now is to ensure that the operational infrastructure of the company is prepared, and we're working towards being able to ensure that customers are deriving the value from that software as well as obviously putting in the operational capabilities to ensure the renewals, et cetera. So that's what we're focused on. Kelly, any...? No, I think you hit it. Yes, sure. So on your question on the deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred, so that was up 28%. The big driver we have for that, that is just purely product, okay? So it is -- what we mostly have in our unbilled deferred is from our collaboration, our Applications business. They have a lot of periodic billing that they book month-to-month. That is a very large number. So it is kind of apples-to-apples of business that we have booked that we will recognize in the future. So that's why we look at both. When we do adopt ASC 606 for Q1, that will be one of our disclosures, showing you the combination of deferred plus unbilled, so you have our remaining performance obligations. But it is just product, that 28%. As far as the ASC 606, we adopt that in Q1. So in the results we just went through, of the $6.1 billion of deferred from software and subscriptions, that is related to how we've been accounting for it under the old ASC 605. So when we go in... Yes. So yes, I can give you some direction. You'll see that in our K. So we will be writing off a portion of that balance. So of the $6 billion, we will be writing off and restating because you basically restate your balance sheet for the new accounting rules. And like we've said over the past year, where we will have that impact is things that were term-based software licenses, things like our ELAs or Cisco ONE, those will now be recognized upfront where they used to be deferred. So the deferred revenue balance will be written down for that, and we'll take -- so we'll take -- we'll lower the balance of the deferred revenue. And then as we go into Q1, we will be recognizing any new business that we bill upfront from that. Yes, Ittai. I was feeling pretty good until you asked the first part of your question. I have said publicly, I think we're operating in a -- we have been operating in, what I would call, it's been a very consistent global economic scenario. There's clearly, even in the last few weeks, been things that have arisen. You've got the strengthening of the dollar that you mentioned. You've got some uncertainty in a couple of emerging countries. So those are clearly things that we'll watch. And we're -- we've seen these in the past, and we know how to deal with them. We obviously have the impending tariff situation, which we're watching closely. And on that front, we're in deep discussions in Washington with the administration on trying to get to a favorable outcome. We'd like to see that land in a good place. But overall, all of those are things that we are very actively involved with and we watch on a daily basis. As it relates to the networking business, the Catalyst 9000, as I said previously, has been the fastest-ramping product that we've ever built. So the customer count became less of an indicator pretty quickly, and it flowed through to the infrastructure systems growth that you saw this quarter. So we didn't see it as a metric that was -- we usually use that metric on customer count when we're just trying to give you visibility to the ramp of a new product when it hasn't become real material to the revenue line. And I think that we exceeded that point in time with the 9K pretty quickly. But I will tell you, just so you know, I think -- Kelly, keep me honest on this -- I think we had roughly 9,650-plus customers on the 9K as of the end of the quarter. We had a great Q4, great adoption. And we're very happy with where that product and that architecture is. Let me answer the macro question about the overall situation we see in service provider, and then, Kelly, maybe you can cover the routing and the impact, the first part of the question. So Pierre, the -- in the service provider space, we were obviously pleased. I've said a number of times over the last couple of years that this is a business that is dominated by large customers. And so as we've always said, when we have several of them that are slowing their spending, then it looks bad; when we have several that are spending, it looks pretty good. And that's just the nature of this business. Relative to 5G, I will tell you that -- I think I've said this on prior calls. Starting at Mobile World Congress earlier this year, we really -- we heard these customers in earnest begin and engage in discussions around what network requirements would look like for the infrastructure to support 5G, assuming that they're going to add lots of high-speed connections at the edge, it will require high-performance networks with quality of service and slicing and all those things. So I would say that -- I would not say that this is a material result of the implementation of 5G, to be honest. We expect that is still a year out before many will start and probably see it in earnest into 2020, to be fair. But we're pleased with what our teams have done. It's been a tough market. Our teams have continued to battle. And our engineering team continues to work on next-generation innovation, and we're pleased with the results this quarter. Kelly? Yes, and to the point of -- this why have better revenue, if you remember last quarter, the SP segment was down 4%. And you're seeing that flow through the revenue this quarter when we talked about routing overall. So when I look forward, we don't kind of talk about our guidance in the upfront by business. But some of this, on the order side, might play well as you go into Q1. What I will say, adding on to Chuck's comments is, I do think and as you know very well, our service provider segment is made up of very, very large customers. And in any one quarter, we can get big orders, and that can fluctuate around. So as to the sustainability, I would say we feel good about our position, though I expect this could move around either way as we look forward. If you don't mind, Sami, I'm going to answer the second one, and then I'll give you a little qualitative color on Europe. And then Kelly will answer the specifics on the business expectations. So on the second part of your question relative to Viptela and software-defined WAN, we have 2 offers. We have -- Meraki has an offer -- for those customers who have embraced the Meraki architecture, they have a very effective SD-WAN solution that is actually being well received in their customer base, and they're using it to extend their customer base. So that's been very successful. On the Viptela front, we have been working hard on the integration between the Viptela platform and Cisco's product. And so we're going to have a variety of offerings for our customers. We'll have a version that will have software running on different types of hardware. We'll have a software-only solution. We'll have our integrated ISR solution. And so we're seeing a number of those. This was a quarter where, I would say, we really saw the engagement level increase significantly. We got the offers in the marketplace, the first wave of those. And I said on the Q3 call that our teams were signaling us that Q4 was where we're going to see some of this come to fruition, and we, in fact, did. So we feel good about where we are right now. There's more work to go. We haven't gotten the SD-WAN integration into DNA Center yet. So that will only be, I think, a positive boost when we get that done. The teams are working on that. I think it's coming in one of the upcoming releases. So in general, we're pleased with where we are at this moment in time with Viptela. Europe, our team is doing really well there. Our teams are executing well. I think that they are competing very well because we have some very tough competition there. We have --- the team in Europe is always one of the early teams leading with some of these new technology areas. So they've had a lot of success in this core enterprise networking space as we move to intent-based networking. So we're pleased with what they're doing. We feel the entire global macro environment right now, there are so many dynamics that we're calling it like we see it based on what we know today. And Kelly, you want to comment just on how we see the...? Yes, I mean, I think just to add to your point, I think the environment's very strong in Europe despite the political things that are going on. And just as a data point, the U.K. is up double digits for us on product orders this quarter. So again, it is -- I think like Chuck was saying, the overall environment is very favorable as of right now. So we're hoping we see this continued strength. Yes, and a lot of the innovation that we're bringing right now is actually targeted at helping our customers lower the expenses of running this infrastructure. So there's a significant play to be made in -- almost like as customers look at where they are economically, there's reduction of cost by going to this automation platform. There's reduction of cost by moving to SD-WAN. So these are technologies that we are hopeful will continue to be important to our customers regardless. Yes, thanks for the question. No, I don't think you need to read anything different of what's happening on the margin. I mean, if I look at the puts and takes that we have to our margin, I spoke a little bit about we can have -- we have a little margin pressure this quarter in some specific deals in APJC. But otherwise, our margin is driven by the same things, right? Our pricing is very robust. We're being very disciplined. The price that you've seen in the last couple of quarters is in a range that's very, very strong, so that's good. We are still facing component headwinds. And even though it's less of a headwind, it is still higher year-over-year. The prices are up, it's, again, just the slope is less. But that's part of what we see, both in Q4 and the guide. And then everything else, it kind of balances out. So right now, this is kind of what we see. We obviously are going to be driving for as much as we possibly can, but it's really the same dynamics. You want to take the first, the clarification on... Yes, sure. So on the component stuff, yes, DRAM is loosening, though, again, as I said, the prices still are up, whether you look quarter-on-quarter or year-over-year. But we are optimistic that both on the demand side, which is also driving some of that pricing, we expect that to get better through '19. And I don't know if you want to hit the other broader... Paul, it's a virtually impossible question to answer, although I'm pragmatic enough to know that it's a combination of both. I will say that I think that it's -- clearly, the economy has been pretty consistent, and the markets have been positive. So that has certainly helped. And I think correspondingly, this new architecture and the new technology that we brought out first -- about 4 quarters back, actually, right at the end of Q4 from a year earlier, has clearly been adopted at a record pace for us. So I could never possibly give you any sort of split on what that looks like. The best I can do is acknowledge that it's a bit of both. And there are a lot of things going right, right now. But there's also, as we said earlier, and Ittai asked the question, there's a lot of dynamics out there that we're watching very closely. So sorry, I can't give you a better, more specific answer. But I think that's as honest as I can be. Sure. So like I said in the prepared remarks, on the security side, they continue to have -- they're over -- 60% of their business is software. And so obviously, they have a lot of their business going through deferred revenue, and they continue to grow in high double digits. So we feel good about that. They had a very strong Q4. And like I said, from a revenue perspective, it was broad-based this quarter, driving that 12% up on revenue. It was across all of their subsegments. So I'd say it's continuing to grow very quickly. And with this addition of Duo, it really just rounds out the portfolio very well. In terms of HyperFlex, I mean, that's growing very strongly for us. I think this new release has been well-received. And again, we find ourselves in a lot of head-to-head deals and winning against Nutanix, which is obviously a really tough competitor out there. But we feel good about the offer we have. Now it's really fairly small compared to the broader data center business that has all of our servers in there. But we're pleased with how it's ramping and how we're competing. I think that's exactly right. Yes, Simon, so it's a really good question. And I think the key message for us that we're trying to get across is that this transition to this multi-cloud world actually is changing the way our customers look at building their IT infrastructure and how they secure it. So if you just think very simply that -- look back over the last 5 to 7 to 10 years, a great majority of the traffic in our enterprise customers' networks was terminating in their private data centers. So networks were architected and security architectures were built to deal with that reality. Now we're moving into a world where there is still some percentage, depending on the customer, of their traffic that is obviously terminating in a private data center. Then they have traffic terminating in SaaS applications, in multiple public cloud providers. They have this whole IoT edge data aggregation issue. So what's happened is the traffic flows, and the way data is moving across their networks and across their infrastructure, is much more complex than it was 5 to 7 years ago, where it was all very predictable, which leads us to, when you think about, ultimately, our customers are going to just need to build a world where you look at the user, you look at the application, you look at their policy and you look at the destination, and then you have technology in the network that actually provides policy routing, quality security in that world. And that's the role that we're playing with our customers because they need to re-architect their networks to accommodate a massively diverse traffic flow scenario that they're going to deal with. So I'll stop with that right now, but that's why it's so important. And you asked what does that do to our partnerships with the web-scale providers. Well, they understand this dynamic that is going on. And so many of the -- you're seeing some early -- some of the early work we're doing with some of the web-scale providers to ensure that we have integrated hybrid cloud solutions so that we can provide security and policy, whether applications are in the private data center or in the public. They're interested in our ability to process data at the edge as customers are building out IoT applications. They're interested in us helping define security architectures that make it simple for our customers to take advantage of their services. So it's emerging as a really attractive partnership because of the reality that everybody sees in the marketplace today. And hopefully, that was clear. If not, we can have some folks talk to you afterwards. A quick question, Chuck. Earlier in your remarks, you mentioned with service provider strength coming back that you don't believe it's 5G-related, that's more of a 2020 phenomenon. Can you give us a little bit about a history lesson here of back in 3G or 4G or 2G uptakes, was there a linear into-the-build that happened? Is there a pause before the [positive event] happens? Or is it just more of a steady as she goes, as we kind of look ahead more longer term, strategically to 5G impact to Cisco? Yes, Jim, it's a good question. I think if you go back and look at the earlier transitions in this space, they have largely been around delivering, and I don't want to say incrementally better, but a better performance for mobile devices that are connected to the network already. So when you go from 3G to 4G, you get better data performance. You're happier with your apps on your phones, et cetera. This is a step-level difference because we're talking about the latency dynamics of 5G and the belief that this will actually enable them to deliver real-time business applications to small offices or remote branches over 5G networks. That's a completely different dynamic. And so I would tell you that we're -- we don't know yet. But I think if you operate under the assumption that it lives up to its billing, then it is going to create a significant demand on the core networks of the service providers. And so I can't say that there's a huge historical example for us to learn from. But I think what you're going to see is just between now and when they start building these things out, they're going to be working on design. And then we're just going to see them begin to gradually build out. As they open up a certain market, they'll build out bandwidth and backbone capacity. And that's how we're thinking about it. And we'll be able to give you guys updates on upcoming quarters as to how we see this thing emerging. It's not going to happen overnight. Okay, Tal, let me make a comment on the first one, and then Kelly can add to it and then she can give the 606 answer as well. I think when you look at our routing business, first of all -- Kelly, half of it, 50%, 60% of it is SP, right? I mean, it's -- so it's significantly impacted by the SP. Some of the players you mentioned, they probably have a much higher percentage of their routing businesses coming from service providers, would be my guess. So that's just sort of couched in the discussion on 5G and everything that we've said so far about SP, I'd say, is the answer on that piece of it. From an enterprise perspective, Tal, I think over the last couple of years, we've just seen a classic architectural stall in the marketplace, as we've talked about historically when there's a big architectural transition. And you said that we believe Viptela was going according to plan. I think the way I would characterize it is we've begun to see customers actually move forward with deployments, but it's early. But we like where we are and we like what we see. So I think that -- I think we'll see the enterprise continue to improve relative to this architectural clarity. And I'll let Kelly answer sort of how you think about the overall routing or the 606 question. Yes, so on 606, Tal, so just to kind of, again, ground everybody on how we're impacted on 606, so one thing I will say is operationally, nothing has changed, right? We've made no changes to our offers. We've made no changes to our contracts or any changes to our cash conversion cycle. So it is literally just an accounting change. Now what the implications are to us is, like we've said, this is going to accelerate some of our term-based licenses. So we will have to write off some of our deferred revenue. We won't see that revenue, but we will offset that with acceleration of those offers when we book new orders and bill new orders. Net-net, we think it will be a net positive for us of approximately 1%. And so that's the impact on the revenue. It will fall through down through margin. So it's on operating margin, 0.5 point to 70 basis points, roughly, of goodness falling through there. And as we go into the new rev standard as part of our disclosures, we'll be laying out very clearly for everybody, since we have -- we're adopting the modified retrospective approach, we'll lay out very clearly the implications of the new accounting versus what it would have been under the old accounting. So hopefully, that answers your question. Yes, no, that's a great question, George. So there's good news. There's good news there, I would say. So like we anticipated, as we are so rapidly ramping the Cat 9K and as we are blowing out DNA across not only that, but also our Viptela offerings and across wireless, the revenue headwind was getting more closer to 2.5 to 3 points. Now the good news on this is with the new revenue standard going forward, because it's accelerating some of these offers that we did have previously defer, that headwind will become less of a headwind, okay? So as opposed to the 2.5 to 3 under current accounting standards, that will be much less, closer to like 1.5 point or so, if I had to guess roughly. And again, this will all flush out as we go through it, but it will become less of a headwind because we have such a big portion of things that we will now be recognizing upfront. You said that it was a 1% increase on the other side... On the revenue, exactly, exactly. So mathematically, it would become a down a point. The good thing about this accounting standard is it does normalize some of the -- some of the natural headwinds we've had on revenue and margins because of it is now going to kind of come back and benefit us. All right. I want to -- I think that was the last question, Marilyn? So if I could, just thank everybody for spending time with us today. Thanks for the questions and the dialogue. And Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you. Thanks, Chuck, and thanks, everyone. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings results, will be on Wednesday, November 14, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Cisco's Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.","So my question to you, Chuck, and Kelly, please chime in, is it reasonable to assume you'd be extending the software subscription idea and plan across the portfolio? Give us an early glimpse as to how is it going? What are some of the challenges? What are some of the positive surprises? And would the makeup of the software subscription portfolio meaningfully change as you look to extend this model across the portfolio? I'm kind of beside myself, don't know where to start. These are so good. But let me -- I guess, let me kick off with a question on the deferred revenue, Kelly. The -- you said that including this off-balance sheet, deferred is up 28%. Is that total deferred or product deferred? Can you just clarify what you meant by that? And also, maybe help us understand what that ASC 606 impact on deferred was because that was, I guess, negative? Just to clarify, though, would you write down some -- you'll write some of the deferred down in Q1 as a result of the change or not much or...? I guess, Chuck, maybe you can help me figure out how you managed to navigate so well in what seems to be such treacherous waters out there between some deceleration in economic activity in Europe; the FX movement recently, which is not favorable to you, although you price in dollars, nonetheless, makes your products a little bit more expensive internationally; poor CapEx matrix out of the large telcos; tariff wars. Globally, you seem to be moving along, sidestepping all of those things. Which of these things really bother you, concern you or you're watchful, you're preparing for? And then second question, maybe you can kind of dig in a little bit on the networking, the Cat 9K, clearly, good progress. Are there any customer matrix or anything you can give us there to help us solidify or get better visibility into the trend there? I actually wanted to ask you about service provider. So you returned to growth this quarter, which is fantastic. And I think you mentioned as well that your routing business was weak, and most of that weakness was in the service provider vertical as well. So I was curious to understand how you grew revenues, if -- even if routing was negative or maybe I got something wrong? And then, of course, I'm very curious to hear whether this recovering service provider spending might be driven by 5G already. My first question has a lot to do with Europe and the strength you saw in the region in this last quarter. And then is it safe to assume that going into next quarter and your very strong guidance, are you expecting to see the same kind of magnitude of strength in Europe again despite all the moving pieces politically? And then the second question I really have is about the Viptela product launch. Are you addressing customers that are already big users, end customers of the campus product and the Meraki products to kind of up-sell customers into your new Viptela product? Or maybe you can give us just an idea on the sales cycle and the customer base that you're addressing. I just had a question on the guide for the first quarter. You clearly have good momentum on the top line, although when I look at the operating margin guidance, it's kind of flat year-over-year. So I was -- just want to check if there's something that's limiting kind of the flow-through of the solid momentum on the top line to the operating margin? Is there something that's limiting the leverage of that to the bottom line? And is that something we should hope for in the future and provides kind of a second leg to the earnings growth? A clarification question. Kelly, just in response -- your previous response, I trust you expect DRAM, at a minimum, to moderate come next year. And I'm wondering what -- if you have any thoughts on the impact. And the larger question, I recognize this has been asked and answered in various forms. But Chuck and Kelly, my takeaway from your comments is that there's an awful lot of things going right. And my simple question is, how much of this do you attribute to the macro? And I recognize even in that portion, it's not simple in terms of different moving pieces globally. But how much of the strength is macro-related? How much of it is better execution in various areas like campus switching, et cetera? It's been a while since we got a security metric update. Can you just kind of walk through some of the past metrics you've given or what you're willing to give today? I know in the past, you've given deferred revenue growth as well as penetration of certain products like FireAMP. And then secondly, HyperFlex version 3.0 was released, I believe, recently. Can we get an update as to kind of how we should think about the sizing of that business or any metrics around hyperconverged infrastructure and how it's competing against the Nutanixes of the world? I wanted to see if maybe we could talk a little bit longer-term trending, big picture around the concept of multi-cloud, which you talked about at Cisco Live! and on a number of other occasions. Within the answer, I think what I'm looking for is how does this help the evolution and transformation? And importantly, how does this help Cisco do more business with the web-scale customers? I want to ask about the routing. Just again, it's repeatedly under pressure. And you gave an answer before about Viptela. You're saying that it's going according to the plan. I'm wondering if there's a link between the 2 yet or that the pressure in routing has to do with other things and not to do with SD-WAN. That's the first question, kind of to understand -- or maybe you can provide a different explanation, to understand the pressure on routing and what's the outlook for recovery. Or is it like Nokia and others are saying, that maybe there is a long-term pressure on this market? Second question, just a follow-up on 606. What's the impact on operating margin if you've provided this or you provide this information? I guess, Kelly, I was curious about the revenue headwinds that you're seeing from the subscription transition. You've talked about that in the past. I'm just curious about what that might have looked like in the July quarter. And then what do you think that will look like for the October quarter?

CSCO,Q2 2018,2274,3758,1326,"Thanks, Kim. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter. In Q2, we returned to revenue growth, we continued to drive momentum in our intent-based networking portfolio and saw strength across the business. We made continued progress in shifting more of our business toward software and subscriptions. This performance led to strong margins, solid cash flow and double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. We are clearly seeing the results of the strategy we've articulated to you over the last 10 quarters. We also increased the dividend and share repurchase authorization, reinforcing the confidence we have in our future. As we shared with you previously, customers are facing ever-increasing complexity in their IT environments with the proliferation of devices and IoT, the adoption of multiple clouds and the exponential growth of security threats. The network has never been more critical to business success because of its ability to simplify this complexity while enabling real-time informed business decisions. This is why Cisco is well positioned for the future as we help our customers move to highly secure and intelligent platforms for their digital businesses. Now let me take you through what I'm seeing across the business and how Cisco's innovation is driving momentum across the portfolio. First, let's start with infrastructure platforms. We continue to be intensely focused on delivering differentiated innovation in our core, which has resulted in our return to revenue growth this quarter. Last June, we launched The Network. Intuitive., a fundamental reinvention of networking and the industry's leading intent-based networking portfolio. Two weeks ago, we announced the next phase of this intent-based network innovation with powerful assurance capability spanning across our Data Center, Campus and Wireless portfolios. These will help our customers unlock the power of network data and will bring greater insights and visibility with rich predictive analytics. We saw strong adoption of our subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform as we more than doubled our customer base from last quarter to over 3,100 customers. This is the fastest-ramping new product introductions we've had in our history and a fantastic example of the innovation we've delivered over the past 2 years. When I became CEO, I challenged our team to increase the pace of innovation in the space, and I could not be more proud of what they've accomplished. The network is also a key enabler for our customers as they increasingly adopt a multi-cloud strategy. They need a unified, automated and scalable environment across their data centers, private clouds and public clouds. Cisco's cloud management, analytics, automation and security, combined with strategic partnerships such as Microsoft and Google, position us very well to meet customer needs. Further extending our cloud-focused software offers, we recently introduced a Cisco container platform to simplify the deployment of cloud-native applications in containers with Kubernetes. This marks an important milestone in our partnership with Google to deliver the future hybrid cloud architecture. In general, we are encouraged with the overall progress we are making with the web-scale community. Now turning to security. Cybersecurity continues to be a top concern for customers as they evolve their enterprise architectures to address the challenges of a pervasive threat environment. We are leading the security industry with an integrated architecture and a comprehensive best-of-breed portfolio across the network, endpoint and cloud. This approach enables us to share context, intelligence, visibility and policy to reduce the time to detect and respond to threats. We expanded our endpoint protection capabilities with Cisco Security Connector, a unique security application designed to give enterprises the deepest visibility and control over network activity on iOS devices. Together with Apple, we are helping our joint customers become the most connected, collaborative and secured organizations in the world. Additionally, Cisco, Apple, Allianz and Aon are collaborating on an industry-first cyber risk management solution, which integrates technology, services and enhanced cyber insurance to make businesses more resilient. Now moving to applications. The future of applications will unlock the power of trillions of terabytes of data across connected users, things and devices. In today's digital world, we are executing on our strategy to transition more of our business to cloud-based subscriptions and driving increased relevance at the application layer of the stack to enable a better experience for our customers. We continue to see progress in scaling AppDynamics analytics capabilities. Over 20% of our top 500 global enterprise accounts have already adopted this technology. This is another example of our ability to scale acquisitions through our unparalleled go-to-market model. We also closed the BroadSoft acquisition earlier this month, which provides us with access to its strong user base of 20 million and greatly strengthens our cloud-based collaboration subscription portfolio. To summarize, I'm very pleased with the traction we're seeing in our business, the progress we're making against our strategy, and I'm very optimistic about our future. I'd also just like to say how incredibly proud I am of Cisco's leadership in environmental, social and governance issues, including the work we're doing to help solve the global skills gap. Our recent recognition by Barron's as the #1 most sustainable company in the United States underscores our deep commitment to enable a better world in which everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by a discussion of the impact of tax reform and then end with Q3 guidance. Q2 was a strong quarter with results exceeding our expectations. We executed well in a number of areas, including good orders momentum, solid revenue growth and strong margins and cash flow. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, up 3%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.1 billion, up 10%; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. Operating cash flow grew 8% to $4.1 billion, with free cash flow up 10%. We continue to focus on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin rate to 31.7%, up 0.7 points. Let me provide more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was up 3%. Infrastructure platforms returned to growth, up 2%, with broad strength across the businesses. Within Switching, we had strong growth in data center switching, and we're seeing great momentum with our new campus switch, the Cat 9K. We also had strong Wireless growth, driven by our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. Data Center was up double digits, driven by server products as well as our HyperFlex offerings. These increases were partially offset by a modest decline in our routing products, driven by continued weakness in Service Provider. Let's move on to applications. Applications is made up of our collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications, conferencing and TelePresence; as well as our IoT and application software businesses, Jasper and AppDynamics. Applications was up 6% in total, with strength in TelePresence and conferencing as well as AppDynamics, offset by some weakness in UC endpoints. There was also a strong increase in deferred revenue, up 18%. Security was up 6%, with strong performance in unified threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 38% as we continue to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 3%, driven by growth in software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q2, we generated 33% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of 2 points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 52% of our software revenue. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 10% in total, with product up 19% and services up 4%. Deferred revenue, product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was $5.5 billion, up 36%. We saw strong momentum in Q2 product orders, growing 5% in total. Looking in our geographies, Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was flat. Total emerging markets was up 1%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 1%. In our customer segments, enterprise was up 3%, commercial grew 14%, public sector was up 8% and service provider declined 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 growth margin was 64.7%, up 0.6 points. Product gross margin was 63.3%, up 0.9 points. And service gross margin was 68.5%, down 0.3 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by the higher memory pricing we have discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was 31.7%, up 0.7 points. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there's been an 80 basis point positive impact on revenue and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS. In terms of the bottom line, our Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $1.78, driven by the onetime charges related to U.S. tax reform. We're very pleased with the tax rate reduction related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since our fiscal year ends in July, we won't realize a full benefit this year but will start -- and we will start to realize that full year's worth in fiscal year '19. For Q2, our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% to adjust to our full year estimated non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. We are currently forecasting our estimated non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year '19 to be 20%. This quarter, we incurred an $11.1 billion charge to our income tax provision that is comprised of $9 billion related to the U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax and $0.9 billion for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets related with the lower tax rate. Our Q2 GAAP tax rate includes the impact of this charge while our non-GAAP rate excludes it. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $73.7 billion, with $2.4 billion available in the U.S. We plan on repatriating $67 billion of our offshore funds to the U.S. in Q3 of fiscal year '18. Q2 operating cash flow of $4.1 billion reflects strong growth of 8%. Free cash flow was also very strong with growth of 10% to $3.9 billion. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $5.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $4 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today, we announced a $0.04 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.33 per share, up 14% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 3.1% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $25 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program. This raises the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $31 billion. We expect to utilize this over the next 18 to 24 months. This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter with solid top line growth, strong profitability, cash flows and order growth. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities, making key investments to drive our long-term growth. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year '18. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We closed the acquisition of BroadSoft in early Q3, and the impact of the acquisition is factored into our guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.64 to $0.66. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Tanks, Kelly. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)","Yes. It's a great question, Vijay. First of all, we're incredibly pleased with the early acceptance of this intent-based portfolio. I called out in my opening comments that this Catalyst 9000 is the fastest-ramping product in our history, which is pretty impressive. I'd say, it's fairly balanced across the geographic regions, probably pretty much in line with what percentage of the business they represent, but Kelly can validate that in just a moment. What I would tell you is that we have 3,100 customers who have adopted this platform. We obviously have the opportunity, and we will extend the capabilities across the rest of our portfolio so that our customers who are driving automation can drive it across not only campus switching but also routing, bringing the Viptela SD-WAN capabilities to play. We are integrating it backwards with ACI in the Data Center as well as within our Security portfolio. So our strategy is to continue to enhance our customers' ability to drive intent across their -- all of their technology areas as well as to gain context through analytics out of all of their technologies. So 3,100 customers so far. I think our total customer population is well over 800,000, so we obviously have room to run. And we also have seen it, I'd say, from a segment perspective, the commercial marketplace has been a great adopter of the technology. And what I would tell you is that the enterprises are -- have been evaluating it because it represents a different architectural approach with automation and analytics and security built into the network. So Kelly, comments on those? Yes. No, just to add to that, I mean, you're correct, I mean, the geography is split kind of in proportion, as you would expect. And across commercial, enterprise and public sector, it's fairly balanced as well. So it's just very broad-based adoption across the board. And again, we're very happy about the adoption of the more advanced software package on the advantage that's very heavily weighted towards that. So we're excited about that. I wanted to follow up on Vijay's question, particularly as it relates to the 9000. Some of the people that we've talked to have indicated that availability of the 9000 may be a little bit limited. I'm just wondering how and over what time frame you may be able to address that. And I guess, as part of that, what are you seeing in terms of attach rates of additional services to the 9000? And are those changing at all as the product rolls out globally? Yes. Let me just make a comment on the overall sort of strategy with the attach, and then Kelly can talk a bit about the supply. James, our original plan was to deliver a subscription model on the switch, and we've been very pleased with the attach rate and the percentage of customers in dollars in that subscription category that are actually being attached in the -- to the advanced subscription, which is -- really contains the automation and it contains the Encrypted Traffic Analytics. And we'll continue to add more and more of the Assurance stuff that we just launched 2 weeks ago. So we wanted to create real value in that subscription so that our customers would believe that it was worthwhile. And I think we're seeing exactly that. So Kelly, comments on demand and... Yes. No, I mean, I think I saw a couple of reports on that. I can tell you, from a demand perspective, we're very excited about how quickly this demand has been. And with any new product launch, we're going to get orders in faster than we recognize them in revenue. That's normal, and I'd say this ramp is normal as well. We did not have any significant supply chain issues of any sort or any shortages on this product line as well. So it's really more just we have tons of demand, and we're very happy to see how quickly the take-up is going. Sure. So just to follow up quickly on the supply and demand. Yes, as I said, it's not a supply constraint issue at all from our supply chain or a parts shortage in any way. I mean, literally, we operate to lead times on our products. And if we get a lot of orders in the last week or 2 of a quarter when, again, as this thing is just ramping every week, we fulfill to our lead times. So there's nothing anything more than that than just we have a lot of demand for the product. So I wouldn't expect any issues as you look forward. In terms of OpEx, Rod, as you know, we are very focused on driving efficiencies. The only thing that will change in our OpEx is we are adding BroadSoft. So in our guidance, we will have obviously the revenue and the margin and the OpEx that comes with BroadSoft. But other than that, we are basically being very disciplined about where we're investing our R&D and making sure we're investing our R&D dollars in the best return project. So you're going to see it move around if we do acquisitions. But otherwise, we're going to be disciplined around that and invest when we can. And when we see margins go up, we're going to be investing as well. But otherwise, we're going to be managing that tightly like we have been. Okay. So Paul, yes, let me address the gross margin rate question first. So yes, we're very happy with our product gross margin rate. And as you and I talk about every quarter, we look at it in terms of what we're getting from price -- what headwinds we're getting from price, offset by what productivity. I would say, this quarter, we had a very, very effective price. We still had a price headwind, but it's at the lowest that it's been in many quarters. So it's less -- it's 1.3 points the way that you'll see it in the Q, Paul. So we're very pleased with that. We haven't been in that level for quite some time. I think maybe Q1 of '17, we're close to that. But again, it shows the discipline between both our product management teams as well as the sales forces being very disciplined about discounting. So we're happy there. We also made some improvements on our productivity, where our productivity this quarter is offsetting the price erosion. So that helped a lot. And then when we get our infrastructure platforms of business going like we did, seeing that return to growth, that helps from a mix perspective. So basically, all 3 of those were very helpful to our gross margin rate this quarter. In terms of the web scale question, Paul, I mean, we don't disclose it. It's not a huge number as we break out the broader company. But I will say that we are making some traction. I don't know, Chuck, do you want to add some comments there? Yes. Paul, I appreciate the recognition. We've been trying to be transparent about this. And we continue to make progress, and I put the comment in the opening comments for a reason that we do continue to make progress. You see the announcements we've made with Google. I said a few quarters back that we were focused on 360-degree relationships with these, and we have more to bring. And certainly, we feel good about where we are, but we still have a lot of work to do. But I would say that every quarter, we're making progress. Yes. Thanks, Tal. So we talked about this before, and this is happening in some of the big web-scale providers. And the great news for us is that we have several different product platforms that meet whatever need the customer's looking for because we have so many customers that will be looking at this transition at different paces. So for those customers that want to go now, we have platforms that address those. The NCS 5500, as an example, has gotten -- has been very well received. We've had routing capabilities in our Switching platforms. And we have our Nexus portfolio that continues to perform very well for customers who are building the data center architectures that we've been focused on for the last 2 or 3 years. So I think that what I would say in summary on this one is that we're probably best positioned to meet the customers' need regardless of which architecture they're choosing and where they are in that transition, and that would be what we would plan on doing going forward as well. On the subscription model itself? Or the Cat 9K overall, both? Yes, okay. So Kelly, keep me honest when we talk about how we price it. But -- so from a technological perspective, I mean, this thing, it's one product in a portfolio of switches that we've gotten out the door. So you can assume there's an architectural play we're running longer term. And when you look at the overarching automation platform, the DNA Center, which is also where the analytics come back to for our customers to drive some of these services like Assurance, we're actually quite pleased. And I think that for our customers, what we wanted to do was we wanted the base subscription plus the product to be somewhere at or slightly below what they would have paid for a previous switch with a perpetual license on it. And then our plan was to create so much new innovation -- not take stuff that they would have bought before because the customers would have felt like we were just changing our financial model at their expense. So what we wanted to put into the advanced subscription was fundamentally new technology that they have never gotten from us before, so that they could warrant the incremental spend because they're getting incremental capabilities. So it's not us taking $1 they've been spending in the past and telling them, ""Now you've got to spend $1.20 a different way."" It was us saying, ""You spent $1 in the past. If you spend it the same way, you may only spend $0.95, but we think we're going to give you so much value that it's going to be $1.20 to $1.25."" And that's been our plan. And I think that the switch itself and the upfront cost is still enough of the acquisition cost that I have not heard partners -- on this particular portion of our portfolio, I haven't heard a tremendous amount of pushback. In fact, I think our partners are thrilled that we've reignited innovation in our core portfolio and given them an opportunity to work these refreshes with our customers. Kelly? Yes. I mean, the only anecdote I will add to this is I was at a customer, and I was actually at an investor meeting and their CIO was talking about the new platform and they were talking about DNA Center, which allows them to manage not just your switches, but your newer version of the enterprise routing and wireless. And the CIO had said, ""I wish I had known, then I wouldn't have bought a competitor's wireless product."" So again, I'm encouraged from the whole ecosystem. We're getting very positive feedback from our customers that way. Kelly, you want to hit the stats? I know them, but I'll let you... Yes, yes. So on the recurring revenue, we talked about, again, we're up to 33% recurring revenue in total. Of that -- again, on the products side of my product revenue, we are up to 13% is recurring. So again, that just continues to grow. That 13% is up over 3 points from what it was a year ago. So we continue to make progress. But 13% of our total product revenue is now recurring, of which all of our revenue 33% is. Just a couple of -- and Cisco ONE customers. Oh, sorry, Cisco ONE customers are over 24,000 now. Yes. And still on the percentage of product revenue that is coming from recurring, that was 6% just 10 quarters ago. So -- and I think the raw number was up 34% year-over-year. So we're pleased with that. And then I completely forgot the second part of the question. Commercial strength, thank you. Yes. So we saw -- that was very consistent around the world. And you've heard us talk about, Ittai, in the past, that our commercial customers tend to be the early adopters and the customers that actually adopt the technology sooner and actually roll it out in the production sooner. Because our large enterprise customers and large service providers, they spend a fair amount of time putting it in the lab, evaluating it. As I said earlier, with the intent-based networking portfolio, they're looking at delivering the automation platforms and all those, which are just a fundamental different way of running their infrastructure. So it takes them a little longer. So largely that was the big driver, but I think it was pretty consistent across the board in the portfolio. Kelly? Yes, it was double digit in every region, and we were up in every single product category -- sub-product category. So it was pretty comprehensive, which, I think, if we're honest, we've got some good new innovation in our portfolio. Obviously, the economy is providing a little bit of a tailwind as well. But I think our teams are executing really well. Yes. Jim, sorry about that. Yes. I mean, I think there's a couple of pieces in there. Don't forget, I still have a very good dividend that I'm paying. I'm paying a $6 billion a year on... Included the $13 billion over the next 2 years. Did you have the $13 billion? If I look at it, I'm in a 34 net cash position right now. We've got the $66 billion we're bringing back. We've got the share buyback and the $31 billion we plan to try to utilize over the next 18 to 24 months. I'll still be in a net cash positive position of 10 to 12 without assuming anything else for acquisitions, and as you guys know, acquisitions are a critical part of our, and always has been, of our overall strategy. So I'd say the way to think about it longer term is we're going to be consistent with what we've said, right, from a capital allocation perspective. We're going to continue to be looking for the acquisitions that we can drive value and drive growth with. We're going to continue to support the dividend and drive that up with earnings, like you saw us do today. And we're going to, again, give back cash now that we have -- all of our cash basically is repatriated all the time now, we're going to be giving back to the shareholders through a healthy buyback. And I think we've got $30 billion to work through to do that. But we'll keep you updated as we go through this every quarter. Yes -- no. So yes, basically, Campus has been up, it's up in orders. But from revenue, we're still slightly down -- modestly down from a revenue this quarter. And we saw strong growth on the Data Center side. But yes, the order side was very, very strong on Campus. So you'll see that flush through going forward. (technical difficulty) Kim, are you there? Yes. We can now, Aaron. Apologies to everybody with our technical difficulties there. I'm sorry about that. Yes, I'll give you a little color on it, and then I think the number you -- I think that's correct, Kelly. We see -- we had a good couple of quarters where the team has really focused on next-generation innovation, lots of partnerships, integrated solutions with analytics and then working on some of the new capabilities around some of the Kubernetes stuff that was announced. And then HyperFlex is obviously still -- it's not a significant portion of that business, but it's growing. And I think, Kelly, 2,400 customers now, we're up to? And so we're pleased with the progress that the teams have been driving. I think that we continue to see new customer adoption. We actually see a lot of the HyperFlex customers that don't overlap with UCS. So we have that opportunity to pull those together. So pleased with how the team is executing there, for sure. You want to go first? Yes, I'll get the BroadSoft. So yes, so in Q2, like I mentioned, we had about 80 basis points of impact from acquisitions, which did not have BroadSoft. When I gave my Q3 guidance, overall inorganic impact bumps up another 0.5 point to about 130 basis points. So a full point is from inorganic. And for BroadSoft -- just to remind everybody, when we do an acquisition and we bring it on to our balance sheet, obviously, what deferred revenue they had ends up going through purchase accounting gets a bit of a haircut. So the first quarters will be slightly less than what they were when they were a public company. But overall, it adds -- we're at 130 basis points overall at the company level. So Jeff, maybe I could just give you sort of a general view on what we saw around the world, and we'll talk a little bit about the sort of the overall economy. We referenced it earlier, the global strength in commercial was something that we're very happy to see. In U.S., we actually saw strength in our federal business. We haven't talked about that today. Across Europe, Middle East, Africa, positive -- everything was positive, except the SP business there. APJC was flat, but that was primarily driven by SP routing deals, largely in China and Japan. So the rest of business, we were pleased with, particularly enterprise and commercial in APJC. And then the emerging markets continued to be somewhat volatile, but I think we saw a slight growth this quarter as well. So from an overall economy perspective, look, we came out of World Economic Forum. We read and see and talk to the same customers and everyone that you do. There's a great deal of confidence right now on a global basis, probably more consistent than we've seen in a very long time. So that's good. But we also -- we believe that we also have driven innovation in our core technologies in the enterprise that we have needed for a long time. And so I think that both of those are contributing to how we feel about it, in addition to the strength across the rest of the portfolio. So we appreciate the strength in the economy, but we're also very pleased with the new innovation as well. Yes. Let me address the second one first, and then I'll let Kelly talk about some of the growth -- the first question relative to growth. I think what we have said all along even before tax reform is that when it did occur, that we would leverage our ability to continue our capital strategies, which you saw today relative to buybacks as well as dividend. But we also have kept plenty of powder dry. We also have, obviously, the ability to take on debt if necessary. And we've also said that in the past, by virtue of our cash being outside the United States with access to the debt markets, we really had no impact on our ability to do M&A. And the bottom line is that we'll continue to look for any M&A targets that actually line up in an integrated way with what we're trying to do strategically. And that's just what we're looking for. I wouldn't put any parameters around the size. I think it's really around strategic fit, both from a technological perspective from what our customers are looking for and then obviously the financial implications. So Kelly, any comments on the revenue? On the revenue growth, we really do only guide one quarter at a time. But again, we are very, very encouraged with what we're seeing with the current portfolio of innovation certainly in the Switching portfolio. Both the Data Center side and the Campus side are pacing well. And again, we are going to keep executing through, and we'll see how that goes. But we feel good about what we see next quarter of the 3% to 5% growth, and we're just going to keep working it from there. Yes. I think it's a great question, Jason. And the rest of the businesses were generally pretty strong. So when we think about SP, obviously, one of the key variables for us is continuing to make the progress that we've been making in the web-scale community, and that's a key focus area for us as they're included in this business. So that's certainly number one. Number two, the consistency of CapEx coming from everyone in the space around the world will certainly be a contributor to the future performance. So that's -- I think that's the other thing that we look for. And then third, as we mentioned at the Financial Analyst Conference, we're also working on some next-generation platforms that we think can help us here as well. So if I had to just pick 3 things, those are the ones that we're focused on. And we're going to take it quarter-by-quarter and keep executing in all of those areas to try to get that business moving in the right direction. So with that, I just want to close by just thanking all of you for joining us today. We really appreciate you spending time with us. Appreciate the questions. And Marilyn, I'll just turn it back to you to talk about our next call. Great. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal 2018 third quarter results will be on Wednesday, May 16, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we all thank you very much for joining today's call.","So my question is around intent based, Chuck and Kelly, please join in, which it seems like it's resonating with your customers. Is this mostly a U.S. phenomenon, Chuck? Are your overseas customers also looking into intent based? And then how do you see intent based kind of catching across the portfolio? Why not extend the intent based across the broader portfolio? I wanted to start off by asking about the OpEx line. That line held relatively stable, even though your revenue beat our expectations. And so I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about how you expect that to move in the future. Do you think this should remain roughly flat on last year? Or where should we be going with OpEx? And then secondly, I want to come back to this Cat 9K supply-demand question and just see if -- is this kind of a situation -- I feel like we usually ask this about smartphone launches, but has the take-up been so fast that you couldn't keep up with demand and now you're able to meet demand? Is that kind of what you're telling us with those comments? I just want to clarify that a little bit. Kelly, I know we're going to see it when you publish the Q, but I was hoping you could tell us the rate of price erosion. And I'm assuming, from the margin structure, there wasn't a change, at least not for the worse, but let me ask the question. And I'm hoping you'll speak about -- I know you haven't gotten there yet. Chuck, you've been very candid about saying that you're late making progress with respect to the cloud. Can you give us any quantification of the growth as well as, as a percentage of revenue? I have a question. When Juniper discussed kind of network trends, they discussed 2 things: migration from edge routers to what they call PTX or MPLS boxes in the core, which brings down prices; and second is the introduction of routing into switching and what Juniper -- sorry, what Arista calls the 7500R. Could you please discuss the implications of these 2 trends on your switching and routing portfolios? I wanted to ask on the 9K subscription model. Chuck, interested in customer and partner feedback and what the puts and takes are there from your customer base and partners. Both and how extendable that would be across the portfolio. Most of the time, we hear positive feedback from large partners, but sometimes there's a cash flow dynamic. And just wondering how that nets out. Just a couple of things from me. Kelly, can you tell us how much of the product revenue was recurring and number of Cisco ONE customers? And then for you, Chuck, I mean, the commercial order is up 14%. I mean, to me, that was the most interesting number. I mean, it's been a while since we've seen such strong strength in such an important and big part of your business. Can you talk about the economic backdrop? What's driving this? What is changing, ability to maintain that momentum going forward? It's really quite an impressive number. The commercial strength. Can you guys hear me now? My question is actually more on the capital return, and so if my math is correct on the repatriation amount of $67 billion. It looks like aftertax-wise, it will be about $57 billion. And spending sounds as if you're going to spend $25 billion on the repo and then another $13 billion over the next 2 years on the dividend. That sort of leaves you, by my math, roughly about $20 billion. How should we think about sort of M&A versus either debt paydown over the next few years or other items? First, just a quick clarification. In the prepared remarks, you talked about Campus getting better. Did you indicate that it's up year-over-year? Or could you confirm if Campus switching is up year-over-year? Can you hear me? No problem. I wanted to ask a question about just your Data Center segment. You talked about double-digit growth. It sounds like UCS was strong. Sounds like you're continuing to get some traction with your HyperFlex product. So kind of updates there on how many customers you have for HyperFlex and what you think -- do you think we're at a point in time where you could see some sustainable growth in that Data Center segment going forward? A clarification and a question first, I guess. And the clarification is, Kelly, would you mind helping us understand how much BroadSoft is adding to the upcoming quarter and maybe to the most recent one, too, depending on the specific close date? And then a bigger-picture question is the macro outlook has, in the past, been a big focus for Cisco and something that has led to more confidence or less confidence in the business outlook. I'm wondering if you could share a little bit about what you are thinking through with the global picture and how that may be helpful or maybe overheated a little bit in certain places. A question on the revenue growth profile. Could we actually see accelerating revenue growth going into the back half of the year? Because the 9K intent-based networking product portfolio is providing for a longer evaluation and lab work by some of your bigger customers. And then once they overcome that, they actually -- you see more of a land-and-grab-expand dynamic. And then, Chuck, I had a question for you in terms of the cash that's going to be burning a hole in your pockets here even after all the different nice shareholder return initiatives you're undertaking here. Do you need to put a stamp on the company in terms of making a big transformative acquisition? Or can you do it in other ways? Chuck, I was wondering what your thoughts are on the Service Provider business going forward and when do you think that might turn around and what would be the puts and takes or the drivers that could turn it around.

As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn. Good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. We are executing well against the strategy we put in place 3 years ago. Our innovation pipeline has never been stronger, and we continue to transform our business to reflect the way customers want to consume our technology. We delivered another quarter of accelerating revenue growth of 4%, solid margins and record non-GAAP EPS up 10%. Our performance was driven by the acceleration of our intent-based networking portfolio, continuing strong customer demand for our innovative solutions and the increasing value of the network. We also made steady progress in shifting more of our business toward software and subscriptions. This resulted in broad-based strength across our products and geographies. As I talk with customers around the world, it is clear that the network is playing an increasingly critical role in helping them manage their complex environments. They are consuming services from multiple cloud providers, multiple SaaS applications, connecting billions of new devices which are generating massive amounts of data, and the network is pervasive across all of these environments. We have been evolving our portfolio to help our customers deal with this complexity and provide unprecedented simplicity, visibility and security across on-premise, hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Now I'd like to review our momentum across key priority areas and share some of the innovations we're driving across our portfolio. First, let's start with Infrastructure Platforms. We are leading the network industry's transformation to intent-based networking across the campus, branch, data center and the edge. We are paving the way to help customers simplify and manage the network. Only Cisco offers an end-to-end, intent-based networking portfolio that delivers assurance, industry-leading security, policy-based automation and segmentation. We continue to see very strong adoption of the Catalyst 9000, the fastest-ramping new product introduction in our history. This includes another quarter of high uptake of our advanced subscription offer in DNA Center, our automation and analytics platform. The Catalyst 9000 now has over 5,800 customers, up from 3,100 last quarter. This is an excellent example of how we've begun to scale our enterprise networking business into a subscription model. We've also recently introduced additional intent-based networking innovations. These include new access solutions and routing software subscriptions which expand our software-defined WAN capabilities onto any platform. We are extending our leadership in data center and cloud by providing highly secure and differentiated offerings such as our ACI SDN solution. With growing 100-gig deployments, especially in cloud infrastructure, we remain well positioned for future growth with our data center switching and intent-based portfolio. We also announced new hybrid cloud workload management solutions with ACI Multi-Site Management and new flexible consumption models, including SaaS delivery for our Tetration platform. Whether deploying enterprise applications or containers in a multi-cloud environment, customers are increasingly turning to Cisco's unique architectural approach. This is leading to strong momentum with UCS, our compute platform; and HyperFlex, our hyperconverged offering, as customers benefit from simplicity and scalability to support their hybrid cloud strategies. Now turning to Security, which is foundational to everything we do. Our architecture delivers highly effective security from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. This unique ability to bring together networking and security at scale gives us a huge competitive advantage. With the largest customer base in enterprise security, it is clear that our strategy is working. The strength we saw in the quarter is driven by our integrated architecture, combined with best-of-breed products. We are also leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to reduce time to detection and remediation. A great example of this is our Talos intelligence platform where we block 20 billion threats every day. We continue to rapidly innovate in security to address key areas of concern for our customers such as security in their complex data centers. We introduced a comprehensive, integrated data center security architecture that is designed to protect the modern data center by seamlessly following any workload anywhere across physical and multi-cloud environments. Now moving to Applications. This quarter, we introduced new innovations across our collaboration portfolio with the convergence of the Cisco Spark and WebEx platforms combined with new WebEx Meetings and WebEx Teams applications. We further enhanced our AI and machine learning capabilities across our collaboration portfolio with the acquisition of Accompany, a relationship intelligence platform with robust insights and intelligence to improve meeting and team experiences. We completed this acquisition last week. We are pleased with the consistent progress we've made to deliver on the strategy we put in place nearly 3 years ago. We have solid business momentum. We are confident in our pipeline of innovation and future growth opportunities. And our commitment to driving value for our shareholders remains as strong as ever. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that we delivered record capital returns this quarter. As part of our commitment to shareholders, we are also very focused on our responsibility as a company to drive impact within our communities through innovation and active engagement. It is not only the right thing to do, but a key requirement for long-term business success. We are deeply committed to our long-standing efforts around sustainability, education and disaster relief as well as other key issues such as hunger and homelessness. I could not be prouder of our achievements or more excited about the impact we will have going forward. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q4. We were pleased with the financial performance in Q3 with broad strength across the business. We executed well with very good orders momentum, strong revenue growth and solid margins. Total revenue was $12.5 billion, up 4%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.66, up 10%. We continue to focus on driving margins and profitability with a strong non-GAAP operating margin rate of 31.5%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was up 5%, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio. Infrastructure Platforms grew 2% with strength in all businesses with the exception of routing. Switching returned to growth with revenue growth in both data center and campus. Campus growth was driven by our new switch, the Cat 9K. We saw solid growth in wireless with strength in Meraki and our Wave 2 offerings. Data center had very strong double-digit growth driven by servers as well as HyperFlex. Routing declined largely with the continued weakness in service provider. Applications was up 19% in total with broad strength across the businesses. We saw very solid growth in TelePresence endpoints, UC infrastructure and AppDynamics. Security was up 11% with strong performance in unified threat, advanced threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 38% as we continue to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 3%, driven by growth in advanced services as well as software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q3, we generated 32% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of 2 points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 55% of our software revenue. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 9% in total, with product up 18% and services up 4%. Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was $5.6 billion, up 29%. We saw strong momentum in Q3 product orders growing 4% in total. Looking at our geographies, Americas grew 4%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was up 3%. Total emerging markets was up 7%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 12%. In our customer segments, enterprise was up 11%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 2% and service provider declined 4%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 63.9%, down 0.5 points. Product gross margin was 62.9%, down 0.3 points. And service gross margin was 66.9%, down 0.9 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by the higher memory pricing we have discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was strong at 31.5%. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there's been 120 basis point positive impact on revenue and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS. In terms of the bottom line, non-GAAP net income of $3.2 billion was up 6%, while GAAP net income was $2.7 billion. We grew non-GAAP EPS 10% to $0.66, while GAAP EPS was $0.56. We delivered operating cash flow of $2.4 billion, down 28%. We paid $1.3 billion of onetime foreign taxes during the quarter related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Operating cash flow increased 11% normalized for these tax payments. We repatriated $67 billion of our offshore funds to the U.S. and ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $54.4 billion, with $47.5 billion available in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $7.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $6 billion of share repurchases and $1.6 billion for our quarterly dividend. We recently announced an agreement to sell our Service Provider Video Software Solutions business. We expect this transaction to close in Q1 fiscal year '19 subject to any regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. We are continually looking to optimize our portfolio. To summarize, Q3 was a good quarter with solid top line growth, strong profitability and order growth. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities, making key investments to drive our long-term growth. Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '18. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.68 to $0.70. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move on into the Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions) So with that, I'll turn it to you, Michelle.","Great. Chuck and Kelly, I guess I wanted to ask, as you -- one of the key things that investors are looking at is the continued growth in subscriptions, et cetera. And it seems like the deferred continues to grow nicely. One of the key questions that we have though is, as you continue to show good demand for the new Catalyst 9K products and distribution expands, what are you seeing in terms of attach rates for subscriptions to that new product? Are they maintaining the levels that you had seen at the early stages of launch or are they starting to normalize back to more traditional levels? Just trying to get a little color on how well that tying strategy is working for you. Yes, James, thanks for the message. I'll comment. And then if Kelly wants to add anything, we'll let her do that as well. I would say it's been very consistent over the last 4 quarters, I think, since we put it in the marketplace in Q4 of last fiscal year. I think we had 1 month of activity. So it's been incredibly consistent. We're really pleased with the acceptance of this product. I think adding 2,700 more customers in the quarter, if you think about that, that means we added over 40 customers per day that acquired a Catalyst 9000 for the first time. And the acquisition of that product, in my opinion, is a clear belief in the next-generation architecture with the automation platform that we're announcing, which is what the advanced subscription model requires. And so I think that's reflected in the continued high uptake that we see on the advanced subscription. Kelly? Yes. No, I think that covers it. Vast majority is the Advantage, which has the advanced features and the higher margin profile. And then the only other thing I would add is, it is very evenly spread across commercial, enterprise and public sector in terms of the demand and where we're seeing all the business. Yes. So in general, I think the trends on both routing and service provider video, which is in the other bucket, have been consistent. And we're not assuming any improvement in either of those. So I would say our guide includes what we see. We feel really good about the rest of the portfolio, actually. And we see very good growth there, but those 2 trends are not improving. So that's basically what I have included. Yes, sure. On OpEx, it's mainly driven by -- the increase is mainly driven by the acquisitions we've run, specifically AppDynamics. As you know, when we bought AppDynamics, very early stage. We're in heavy investment phase with them. So that's part of it as well as we've consolidated now BroadSoft. And then that also has a fairly high OpEx impact. If I back out -- if you look at my OpEx growth for the quarter, which was up a little less than 6%, 4 points of that alone is just purely the acquisitions. And that's, as I mentioned, the impact of acquisitions on my top line and it's hurting me on EPS. It's mainly in the OpEx line. So that's what's driving that. We're being very disciplined within the rest of the business to managing the portfolio. So I think it'll continue kind of in that range as we look forward to Q4, but that's kind of the underlying driver. Okay. First of all, thanks, Ittai, and thanks for the positive comments. On the 9K, I think that we have roughly 840,000 customers. And I would say that there's a very long list of customers that are still available to us to deliver this platform. If you look at -- the products that we have put in the market and the new Catalyst 9K family are sort of like -- if you stack our portfolio and you say, we have a very low-end switch and then you have the old Catalyst 3000, the old Catalyst 4000, those are kind of the platforms that the current 9K family replace. So there's still a very long tail of customers. The other thing you have to remember is, many of these customers are buying the 9K and then it will become the standard platform. And they'll refresh the balance of their networks. The other thing I'll point out is that I think we said on one of the calls a while back that the enterprise segment, we would expect to lag the commercial segment with the 9K. And we did, in fact, see the enterprise business improve, and the 9K was part of that. So I think we still feel good about it. And this architecture has a long future for us. And there's a portfolio of products that sit within it. So I think if we're really honest, the number of customers who are making the decision to upgrade to the 9K, I would say it's not necessarily because, wow, what a new fantastic new Ethernet switch. It's really because they're buying into this automation strategy of which the entire portfolio will sit over time. And I think that's what we're banking on. And that's where we're banking on the long-term success. So the China question, look, if you look at our China business this quarter, we actually saw strength in switching in both the enterprise and commercial segments. And overall, I think there's still uncertainty there. But I believe, and I have been optimistic, and I remain optimistic that the 2 countries will come to some closure on the trade issues and that we'll get stability there. And I think -- we still believe in it. It's going to be, obviously, the largest economy in the world in the coming decade. And we remain committed and actually, we're doing pretty well. If you look at the SP routing business in China, it continues to be stressed, like it is around the world, but much of the other portfolio elements, we're very pleased with. Yes. Let me give some color around how we see the sales model evolving. And then I'll let Kelly answer the financial side of those questions for you. Vijay, I think what you're going to see is that we're actually building a traditional -- I'll say a traditional software model where we have a customer success organization that over time will take on more responsibility for all of the functions in the software company, the whole adoption expansion and particularly, the renewal space, which will allow us to renew a lot of these offers over time. It's a multiyear renewal window. But renewing over time at a much lower cost of sale, I would suggest that, that may give us either some, obviously, operating leverage or it may give us the ability to invest in more R&D or other areas. But that's the model. That's one of the key reasons that we brought in Maria Martinez, who is now our Chief Customer Experience Officer, who is helping us build out that capability, who has a long experience of doing that in several software companies. So that is one of the major efforts that we have underway right now to not only increase our ability and our rates of renewal, but also to do that at a much different cost structure going forward. Kelly? Yes. And just on the SPVSS business, we will -- it is in my guidance right now because we're going to -- obviously, we continue to run this business until the deal closes. It is the majority of what's in the other bucket, Vijay. So it's the bulk of that. But like we did when we divested the set-top box business, once we closed the transaction, we'll give you all the history so we can adjust the model and go forward from there. So you'll have complete visibility all the way through the P&L once we close the transaction. Pierre, can you speak up just a bit? Yes. Yes. Sure. So I'll take that. So first, on the memory. So yes, memory is still hurting us year-over-year. In my product gross margin, it hurt us to the tune of about 60 basis points year-over-year. So more than what we were down year-over-year. It is marginally less bad than it was last quarter, which was marginally less bad than it was a quarter before then. So the slope of the increases are getting less, though it's still increasing year-over-year. So it was about 60 basis points. I would say, in terms of pricing, we had another very, very good quarter for price. We always have price erosion. But like you saw last quarter, our price erosion was at the very low end of what we've seen over the last 3 years, and that continues. And part of that reason of why that continues is, we have been passing on the memory DRAM cost increases through price increases on our servers, like we have been as well as a lot of our peers as well as our product managers in other parts of the portfolio have been really -- being very disciplined about looking at where we have some price elasticity and have been selectively and surgically looking for areas that we could take advantage of price elasticity. So I feel really good about where our price index was this quarter, much in line where it was last quarter. And then to your third point on the software being a benefit, that is true, though, I will say, a portion of that is getting offset now that we're ramping the Catalyst 9K so quickly. And as you know, a portion of that gets deferred because it's a subscription. That has a negative impact on our rate as well. So this quarter, it was about 30 basis points alone just for the Cat 9K alone now becoming bigger in the revenue contribution and impact on our rate. So again, the 3 things are: 60 basis points on memory, 30 basis points on the Cat 9 impact and then we had pretty strong price and some favorable mix coming through from software. The only other last point I will make, we had a very, very strong quarter on our UCS, our server business. And that has a little bit of negative mix for us as well, okay? So I'll start, Paul, and thank you for that -- the opportunity. Listen, I think that what I am most optimistic about is the renewed innovation that we have brought and will continue to bring in our enterprise portfolio, particularly into our core franchises, which was one of the things -- when I spoke to many of you when I became CEO 3 years ago and even when we were on the road last year, I said the #1 priority for us right now. Obviously, we're going to continue the business model evolution, but the #1 priority was to get the enterprise portfolio and particularly the switching business stabilized, which our teams have done a great job. And even if you look at the security portfolio with the team, and then I will tell you on the enterprise routing space, Kelly talked a little bit about the overall routing business. But SP routing is about half. And the enterprise routing, I will tell you that our teams have been working hard on the integration with the Viptela acquisition into our enterprise routing portfolio. And I actually feel really good about how that's coming along, and I'm optimistic about where that goes in the future. And I'm very optimistic about the overall innovation within the intent-based networking portfolio that we're going to bring forward over the next months, quarters and years. I guess if I had to say what I would be most concerned about in general, it's just sort of the macro and/or some geopolitical risk. I mean, you've got -- you've obviously got lots of trade discussions, which I remain optimistic on. But as long as there's uncertainty, then we wait and see. Obviously, the dollar rising, while we had a good quarter in emerging countries, and we're pleased with our execution there, the rising dollar obviously is another macro issue, but I'm very pleased with what the teams are executing on right now. And that's how I'd leave it. Kelly, any comments? Good. Thanks, Jeff. So I'm very happy with what our teams are doing in the data center switching market. In general, I think that the 100-gig transition, we're pleased with the return to growth in both the data center and the campus from a switching perspective. On the web-scale side, I would say the story continues to remain as I've articulated it. We continue to make progress. You've seen the announcement we made, obviously, with Google. We continue to work and execute on the details of those solutions that we announced with them. You'll see more coming out later this year from us there. We continue to engage deeply with all of these players. We've had continued progress with several of them and continued favorable discussions. But these are -- as I've said repeatedly, some of these are multiyear architectural decisions, and they take a while. But again, I'm optimistic and pleased with where we are right now. And I think the other thing I'd point out is that, this environment that our enterprise customers are facing right now where, literally, 4 or 5 years ago, they thought they were going to move to the public cloud and have a much simpler IT world. They now find themselves with 3 or 4 public cloud providers that they're consuming services from. They have 50, 60, 100 SaaS providers. We're beginning to see this real explosion of IoT devices at the edge. They still have their private data centers. Those have not gone away. You've got all of the mobility in customers and suppliers. And so the network is so fundamental to making all that work. And the web-scale providers know that as well, which has really enabled us to build these broad relationships that extend well beyond just the data center. So we're still pleased with where we are and we have a long way to go. Yes, sure. Thanks. And so yes, the headwind is still there because we are very much increasing the number of offers that we have as well as the revenue dollar that we're putting on the balance sheet. So the headwind is increasing. And just as we had talked in the past, now that the enterprise portfolio with the Cat 9K is starting to hit revenue, the headwind is increasing. So we said in the past it was 1.5 to 2 points. It definitely now is approaching the 2 to 2.5. And as we ramp more and more of the portfolio, we'll continue to see that. Yes. So thanks for the question. So yes, on the recurring revenue, it's basically in the rounds. If I look at our product recurring revenue, again, it continues to grow over 30% to over 30% of our total product revenue. And overall, total recurring revenue is again growing in the double digits. So it's really the math and a little bit of the mix now that we have product revenue growing so much faster than services that's driving kind of just the pure math of the round from 33% to 32%. But we feel great about how it's progressing. Yes, if you go to our Financial Analyst Conference, we feel we're right on track of what we projected as that goes out to fiscal year '20. The only caveat I'll give you on that is, when we go into our fiscal year '19, we have to adopt the new revenue standard, which will have some implication on some of the products that are included in this. So we plan to have a call where we can go through the anticipated area that will be impacted to give you guys more clarity. And then we'll adopt that Day 1 of our fiscal year '19. But overall, we feel great about the traction. We're executing very well. And we're on track, if not slightly ahead, of what we expected when we talked at the Financial Analyst Conference. And Srini, just one last comment on the part of your question where you asked if we would need to extend this to other parts of our portfolio. I mean, we will. If you look at the new enterprise routing, some of the comments I made in my opening was that we're extending our software and subscription business in the routing space. Many of those are software solutions. So we'll continue to evolve. And frankly, it's driven by how our customers want to consume the technology, which is great. And as Kelly said, it will create a short-term headwind, but we think long term for the business it's absolutely the right thing to do. I have a brief question for Chuck and then Kelly, more of a clarification one. But Chuck, there wasn't any mention yet, at least on the Q&A, about competitors going into the campus side of things with Arista making an announcement. How do you look at that? I know competition isn't anything new. But do you need to step up your sales efforts? Or how should we think about that? And then Kelly, for the CFO question. How should we think about, you've got time now to think about the tax law, sort through all the changes. Is your outlook kind of 21% outlook long term? And stock cadence, you did a lot more stock buyback this quarter than normal with your new announcement. How should we think about those financial metrics? Yes. So let me hit the first one. Relative to the competition in the campus, what I would say is that, look, we launched this architecture last June. And I think our customers have been incredibly excited about it. One of the very important things that we did is we made the architecture and DNA Center backwards compatible with at least one generation of our wireless products, our switching products, our routing products, et cetera. And I think that taking a look at all of those products is incredibly important because our customers don't want to have an automation platform that handles switching. They want an automation platform that handles the enterprise -- at a minimum, the enterprise network. And then over time, as we integrate our automation platform in the data center and the campus, you'll be looking at the ability to automate from the data center to the campus to the wireless network to the routing and frankly, the security architecture. And we think that is a unique architecture that we can deliver. We are leading right now. We see incredible acceleration of the Cat 9K and adoption by our customers. And we're very comfortable with where we are in this transition. And on the tax question. So again, we feel really good about where we stand in terms of that. As we said in the call, we brought back $67 billion from overseas. And we -- like we said in last quarter's earnings, we announced a big increase to our share buyback authorization. So we have $25 billion remaining in our share buyback. And we anticipate using that in the next, basically, 18 to 21 months. So we're being very aggressive there, like we had stated we would be once we got our cash back. So that's going well. As far as the tax rate, we also stated in Q2 that we expect our tax rate to be in the 21% for fiscal year '18. And we expect it to go down to 20% in fiscal year '19 when we get the full benefit of the U.S. -- the new U.S. federal rate. So overall, we feel great about the tax law and the implications for us. Yes. I mean, again, I think, basically, AppDynamics has been in the numbers as we go along. I would say, BroadSoft has a mix of both perpetual and recurring, so it is not all recurring. I would say the bigger impact on the numbers, and again, it's really just the mix of the products. When we have product revenue growing 5%, services growing 3%. And within that product revenue, we had very, very strong server revenue growth, which has a very low software recurring proponent of it. That's what's really driving it. As I said, overall, the growth of product recurring revenue was over 30%, like it has been for the last 5 quarters. So that just continues to grow. It's really more the denominator of total revenue that's driving just the slight round down to 32%. Yes. Thanks, Tal. So look, we remain confident in the security architecture that we built, even when we had some deviation in the revenue run rate over the last year. And I think that as you look at the architecture that we have, which extends from e-mail to endpoints to the network to the cloud and then has this massive state machine where we can correlate threats and then dynamically defend, it's a unique proposition. And we say that we have this integrated architecture but also best-of-breed products. So where we are convincing customers that the architecture is right, then we're winning. And I think that our teams are doing a really good job. I think that the engineering teams have continued to add new features and new capabilities that our customers are adopting. And I think it's as simple as that. It's just -- it's we have reasonably good traction in the field right now. Well, I mean, we have -- the great thing about this architecture when we build it is that you can continue to add virtually any source of threat intelligence to this because it's built to digest massive amounts. I mean, we see 20 billion threats every day. So you can assume that we can add any sort of capability that we like. That includes threat sources and frankly, the same thing from a defense perspective. So within the portfolio, I think there's always an opportunity for our teams to continue to improve and continue to add features. And there's a lot of good competition in the space. It's very fragmented. So we just continue to execute against delivering that architecture. Just one more revenue question for me. Kelly and Chuck, how should we think about the second half of calendar '18 relative to your fourth quarter revenue guidance in terms of the 4% to 6% goalpost year-over-year? Is there any inflection point with respect to the selling cycle? We've heard anecdotally from some of our checks that it is a slightly longer selling cycle as customers try to understand more the subscription element. And as they do become more receptive, could you actually see accelerating revenue growth maybe closer to that 6% or better as you go into the October, January quarters? Mark, so as you guys know, we really do just give guidance one quarter in advance. And we feel very good about the guidance we gave of the 4% to 6% growth. As we look forward though, just to give you some color, context, in the Cat 9K, the demand is great. We have fantastic demand. We are taking orders like crazy. And there's great adoption out there by our customers that we don't see slowing down. So we feel great about that. But again, there's a lot of moving parts, and we'll take it one quarter at a time. The only other thing I just want to remind you is, we do have -- when our fiscal year starts in August for '19, we do have the tweak on the new revenue standard that we'll take you through any implications of. So feel really good about the Q4 guide, and we're just going to take it one quarter at a time. All right. Good. So I want to just thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate you spending time with us. Appreciate the opportunity to answer your questions. And Marilyn, I'll kick it back to you for the details on the next call. Great. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings call, which will reflect our full year 2018 fourth quarter and annual results, will be on Wednesday, August 15 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.","I just wanted to try to dig under the covers a little bit on the revenue guidance. Obviously, service provider orders are weak and sounds like routing's weak, in line with that. Just wondering if you could, Kelly, maybe give us any idea how much service provider video is affecting that guide and also the routing within that guide, like what are you assuming there. Are you assuming routing continues to kind of drag that growth down? And then I have a follow-up. Okay. And then, Kelly, could you also comment on the OpEx to sales? It's ticking up a little bit in the guide, at least implied. And I'm wondering if you could maybe give us any color on what's moving around in OpEx for fiscal Q4. Chuck, I had a couple of questions. First, on the Catalyst 9K, good progress, but help us understand how big is your Catalyst installed base from a customer standpoint? What percent of it do you really think the Cat 9K is relevant to? Because it's hard to gauge whether you're moving too slow or too fast. 40 customers a day sounds like a lot, but maybe for a company like Cisco it's not fast enough. So help me understand how do you think about driving that throughout your installed base especially with now Arista potentially coming to the marketplace. And then second question, I had a question about China. Clearly, relations there have not been on the good side recently. And you've been somewhat a little bit more optimistic on that country over the last year. What are you seeing out of there? And how do you take that into your outlook commentary? Chuck, Kelly, these are solid results here. You beat on all major categories. A quick question for you. A bigger-picture question actually, Chuck and Kelly as well which is, as your software subscription attach rate sees strength, could we see the sales OpEx, for example, start to trend down? Are you already seeing that impact to your sales OpEx line? And then just a quick tactical question in terms of, approximately, what was the run rate of the SP Video business you've sold to Permira? Because that would help us to inflate your July quarter guidance if it wasn't sold so that it helps us in kind of this if-what scenario basis. I just wanted to... Yes. Okay. Is it better now? So on the gross margin, so you still suffer from these DRAM prices. Has it like improved or is that -- has the pressure like increased sequentially compared to last quarter? And then we've had this pricing for some time now in the market, and I was wondering if -- how are you going to reflect that in your pricing strategy? And when should we expect you to start like passing on these extra costs to your client? And then lastly on the gross margin, I assume that you're still like increasing very fast your share of software and subscription services in your revenue mix. So it should have a positive impact on gross margin. If you can comment on that as well that would be great. Against my better judgment, I'm going to ask you a wide-open question, which is for either or both of you, Chuck and Kelly. What are you most excited about in terms of upside opportunity, whether revenue or margin? And what are you most concerned about in terms of downside risk? You spoke about your progress in the data center switching side of things. I'm wondering if you could help us understand how things are going in the enterprise data center market and how your relationships are progressing in the web-scale data center market or just web-scale in general would be helpful to us outside of data center switching. I wanted to circle back to a conversation from prior earnings calls. You guys had talked about the revenue headwind associated with the move to more subscription-oriented models. And Kelly, I'm wondering if you can give us an update there. Is that still a headwind this quarter? And how do you see that progressing going forward? I guess my question is on the recurring revenue. It dipped a little bit to 32%. If you could give some color on that. And also, I think your target long term is exceeding 37% in fiscal '20. Is that primarily a function of Cat 9K ramping in volume? Are there any other products that could contribute to that? And also, I'm wondering if you need to expand the subscription model to other products to achieve that goal. I actually wanted to circle back a little bit and poke at the recurring revenue piece. And now that it's 32%, and you're noting that you got 120 basis points from acquisitions. Can you help me understand what really drove the decline Q-over-Q from 33% to 32% given that the acquisitions you guys had done have been software in nature? Security was up 11%, which is an acceleration from previous quarters -- the previous 2 quarters. Can you talk about what went right and what went wrong with security this quarter? And what are the things that are driving this acceleration? And can you share with us maybe the areas where you think you need to strengthen your portfolio?

CSCO,Q1 2019,2370,5037,1356,"Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. As is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to our prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. The reclassified amounts have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another great quarter. It is absolutely clear that the strategy and transformation that we laid out 3 years ago was working. We accelerated revenue growth, expanded margins and generated strong operating cash flow and double-digit earnings per share growth. We saw broad-based growth across all of our geographies, product categories and customer segments. This was driven by strong execution, differentiated innovation and our transition to more software and subscription offerings. We are well positioned to capture significant growth opportunities while creating long-term value for our shareholders. In today's environment, there's an ever-increasing number of connected devices with users expecting an always-on experience with access to any application. The enterprise has expanded to now include multiple clouds, and applications are evolving at an unprecedented rate. Customers facing a new level of complexity are increasingly seeing the value of our integrated platforms over stand-alone products. We are fundamentally changing the network and security industry. We're building an architecture that is designed to securely connect any user on any device on any network to any application running anywhere. This creates an enormous opportunity for us as we deliver a multi-domain, intent-based networking architecture that drives automation, simplicity and agility for our customers. Now let's take a more detailed look at our results as we continue to deliver new innovation across our entire portfolio. Starting with Infrastructure Platforms. Over a year ago, we set out on a strategy that would disrupt how growing data from a proliferation of new connected devices and complex traffic flows would be managed and secured from the private enterprise into multiple cloud environments. We brought to market an intent-based architecture capable of capturing business intent and applying it across wired, wireless and enterprise routing, including SD-WAN. This allows our customers to automate their operations, applications and security policies for efficiency and business agility. This value proposition resonates strongly with our customers and is driving continued strong customer ramp of our Catalyst 9000 family of switches. Yesterday, at our Partner Summit, we announced several exciting, new additions to this architecture. We launched the next additions to the Cat 9K family, the 9200 and the 9800. The Catalyst 9200 series of switches extend intent-based networking to simple branch deployments and mid-market customers. The Catalyst 9800 is our newest wireless controller. We continue to help our customers run consistent security, automation and analytics services across wireless and wired environments. The 9800 gives our customers ultimate flexibility, running anywhere from on-premise and any cloud or embedded virtually on Catalyst 9000 switches. We also announced a major new architectural change for the modern branch network. Cisco is unifying our security and SD-WAN technologies to help organizations embrace the cloud faster with choice and confidence. We provide the simplest way to integrate SD-WAN with our cloud security. This is a great example of how the expansion into the cloud is driving our entire portfolio. In the Data Center, as more customers move to multi-cloud environments, the need for secure virtualized infrastructure grows. Our strategy is to enable our customers to address increasing connectivity and data growth while securely enabling workloads across any combination of private, public or multi-cloud environments. We continue to invest in innovation to help our customers transform their data centers for improved efficiency, scale and resiliency. This has resulted in tremendous traction with our Nexus 9K, ACI and UCS solutions as we architect security from the application to the network and support cloud workloads wherever they may reside. Building on the success of our industry-leading Nexus switch portfolio, we recently unveiled new Nexus 400-gig switches. We are committed to leading the market transition from 100 gig to 400 gig, providing customers with increased bandwidth and scale in their data center environments, powering any workload in the cloud. The addition of 400 gig to our Nexus portfolio extends the power of ACI, providing intent-based networking to enterprises, web scale and service providers to enable them to build compact, fully-automated, high-bandwidth fabrics. Cisco is the only company that not only delivers a best-of-breed 400-gig portfolio but also brings customers the architectural solutions for today's multi-cloud world. Last week, we expanded our hybrid cloud portfolio by introducing the industry's first hybrid solution for Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services. We are delivering a hybrid cloud solution that is designed to enable our customers to easily connect, secure and monitor Kubernetes-based applications across on-premise and the AWS cloud. Turning to our Security business. We again delivered another robust performance with double-digit growth. Our goal is to be our customers' #1 security partner. We are building a comprehensive and integrated security portfolio focused on effectively detecting, rapidly containing and quickly responding to threats. Spanning from the Edge to the Data Center and to the cloud, our customers' users devices, applications and data are protected wherever they are. We continue to add more SaaS-based offerings to our broad security portfolio. A great example of this is our recent acquisition of Duo Security, which provides cloud-based identity solutions for Unified Access security and multifactor authentication. Duo solutions play an important role in extending our intent-based architecture into multi-cloud environments, simplifying policy for cloud security and expanding endpoint visibility coverage. The integration of Cisco's network, device and cloud security platforms with Duo's zero-trust authentication and access products is designed to allow us to easily and securely connect users to any application on any network device. Moving to applications. Data intelligence continues to be critical for organizations to improve business outcomes and agility. Our AppDynamics solution uniquely addresses this need, resulting in another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Our innovative capabilities and application monitoring and analytics provides unparalleled real-time business insights to our growing customer base, making us the clear market leader. We achieved a solid quarter in our collaboration business and continue to set the standard for how people connect, collaborate and create every single day. We are defining the future of productivity and collaboration by providing customers of all sizes with a comprehensive portfolio to help them share data through any device anywhere. Customers recognize the value we bring with more than 95% of the Fortune 500 using our collaboration solutions. We're delivering unique capabilities, enabling rich collaborative experiences, increased productivity and helping our customers transform their workspaces. This is accomplished through our new modern WebEx experience, AI-enabled devices and enhanced interoperability across our on-premise and cloud solutions. Yesterday, we expanded our collaboration offerings with a full suite of cloud calling and team collaboration tools to extend our customers' on-premise investments with new hybrid solutions from the cloud to the end user. These innovations include the availability of BroadSoft cloud calling with WebEx Teams through service providers, 85-inch WebEx board and our new portfolio of huddle room solutions with Room Kit Mini and WebEx Share. In summary, we had a great quarter, and our opportunity has never been greater. Our growth continued to accelerate as we executed well against our strategy, continued to drive innovation across our portfolio and delivered more software and cloud-based offerings. It is clear our customers are looking to Cisco as a trusted partner to help them operate in a multi-cloud world and to transform their businesses. We are well positioned with our growing portfolio across multiple domains as we continue to innovate to bring our customers a more secure, automated and simple IT infrastructure. We believe the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, combined with the power of our business model, provides us with a strong foundation for fiscal year '19 to create long-term growth and shareholder value. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you. All right. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q2. We executed well across the business with strong orders, revenue growth, margins, EPS and operating cash flow. We had continued momentum in product orders, which grew 8%. Total revenue was $13.1 billion, up 8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 31.9%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, up 14%. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.75, up 23%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was up 9% to $9.9 billion. Infrastructure Platforms grew 9% with strong growth across all businesses. Switching had another great quarter with growth in Campus driven by the continued ramp of the Cat 9K and growth in Data Center driven by the Nexus 9K. Routing returned to growth driven by Service Provider. Wireless had double-digit growth with strength in our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. We also saw good growth in Data Center driven by servers and HyperFlex. Applications was up 18% with growth across all the businesses. We saw good growth in Unified Communications, TelePresence and AppDynamics. Security was up 11% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat. Service revenue was up 3% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions Software subscriptions were 57% of total software revenue, up 5 points year-over-year. To remind you, we adopted ASC 606 in Q1. There have been no changes to our offerings to customers or our cash conversion cycles. This is purely an accounting change. It does not impact the metrics that -- I'm sorry, it does impact the metrics that show our continued business transformation. We think the most meaningful metric going forward is software subscriptions as a percentage of total software revenue. When we look at the impact of acquisitions in our Q1 results year-over-year, there was an 80 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw strong momentum in Q1 with total product orders growing 8%. Looking at our geographies. Americas grew 8%, EMEA was up 6%, and APJC was up 12%. Total emerging markets was up 16%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 19%. In our customer segments, Enterprise was up 15%, Commercial grew 8%, Public Sector was up 8% and Service Provider grew 2%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 63.8%, up 0.1 point. Product gross margin was 63.2%, up 0.2 point. And service gross margin was 65.7%, up 0.1 point. Our operating margin was 31.9%, up 1.5 points. In terms of bottom line, from a GAAP perspective, Q1 net income was $3.5 billion, and EPS was $0.77. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $42.6 billion. Q1 operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, up 22%, with free cash flow of $3.6 billion, also up 22%. Normalized for the $400 million legal settlement we received from Arista, operating cash flow was up 9%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That was comprised of $5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. From a M&A perspective, we closed 2 acquisitions in Q1 with Duo Security and July Systems. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. To summarize, we had a great Q1. We executed well with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '19. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Note that we have normalized our second quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q2 fiscal year '18, which we divested on October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call. We expect revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 30.5% to 31.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.71 to $0.73. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the lines for questions. (Operator Instructions) I'll now turn it over to you, Michelle.","I guess, maybe I'll direct to say, Chuck and Kelly, and you guys answer where you think it is appropriate. But one of the key questions we've been getting from investors is, if you're seeing any change in customer behavior, either because of pending tariff implementations or macro conditions around the world, you've seen -- in this past quarter, you've seen a lot of volatility on exchange rates as well as the pending implementation of these tariffs. So wondering if you're seeing any change, whether customers are pulling forward deals or reducing deal size, et cetera. So let me -- thanks, James. Let me give you some comments, first of all, and then I'll pass it over to Kelly. First of all, we -- the tariffs were immaterial to us in Q1. The 10% tariffs, I think, we implemented them with a month to go, so we did not see any impact. But I can tell you that from a demand perspective, when we implemented the pricing changes, which we told you we would on the last call, we saw absolutely no demand change from the week before and the week after we did that. We have talked to all of the sales leaders around the world, and I could tell you, there are probably only a handful of customers that have made any indication to us right now that they're doing any pull-forwards. Now that doesn't mean that there's not stuff out there that we don't see, but in general, we do not view this as a broad-based issue. And our momentum from the first week of the quarter until the last week of the quarter was incredibly consistent. So Kelly, any comments? Yes. I mean, I'll say just to add some -- add to that. If I look at the linearity by month through the quarter of Q1, it was the exact same as it was in Q1 '18. So we didn't see -- for the 10% tariffs, we didn't see any pull-ins. And just to kind of remind everybody. We are actively working with our supply chain to mitigate as much of this as possible, and we've made progress. For that, that we couldn't mitigate, we passed on, and we passed on the price impact, so just to the products impacted versus broad-based. We were very specific and surgical where we applied it. But overall, we are very specific. Going into Q2, like Chuck said, it's pretty straightforward, but I would hope that it is a potential that drives some demand. But the underlying strength of the IT environment is still there. Yes. Two other quick comments. I can just tell you, personally, I haven't had one conversation with any customer around the tariffs at this point. Secondly, I think that once we got past the midterms, we've begun to hear some positive, at least, headlines relative to the discussions. And I remain fairly optimistic that this has become a top priority for the administration, and we're hopeful that they'll come to some agreement before we move to anything more significant. Yes, thanks, Vijay. Let me comment because this was at the heart of our presentation this week at the Partner Summit. And there's a significant recognition that, I think, is occurring in the marketplace right now. If you look at what our customers are dealing with, they are dealing with a world that truly does involve consuming services from multiple cloud providers. Most of our customers have well over 100 and beyond SaaS applications that they're dealing with. They still have increased investments in the Data Center. They're beginning to see IoT explosions at the Edge, data at the Edge, mobile workers everywhere, interconnectivity with suppliers and customers. And what that has done is it's completely made obsolete the original assumptions on which they define their IT infrastructure. And so the IT infrastructure was built based on assumption of traffic flows that just fundamentally don't exist anymore. And so what we're seeing is that they now need to drive security and policy and automation from the Campus to the Data Center to the branch into the cloud. And they're looking more and more at the simplicity of having a single architecture to provide that capability. So one of the big things that we talked about this week was the need to drive multi-domain architectures for our customers, which actually give them the ability. And you're seeing us extend and connect like policy in the Campus with policy in the data centers. So you're seeing ACI being connected into DNA and our Software-Defined Access technology in the Campus so that we can extend policy. You saw this week with the branch where we integrated our SD-WAN with our security -- cloud security portfolio. So -- and I think we're seeing that come through in more and more of these broad-based software licenses that we continue to see our customers adopting. So I think that we are seeing that play out exactly as we thought, Vijay. Kelly, any... No. Rod, thanks for the question. Let me just give you some -- a little color, and then Kelly can answer some specifics on the math. I would say, the last 2 quarters were probably the most consistent, strong quarters that we've seen in years, honestly. And I think it's a combination, as we've talked about, of the macro environment but also, frankly, the innovation. If you look at the portfolio that we have put out there and you look at the number of announcements and the technology and the innovation that we delivered this week, I think you're going to continue to see strong execution. We're really proud of what our teams have done. So -- and I think that the recognition by the customers of this architectural shift that I was talking about earlier is really beginning to play out. So we feel really good about how we're performing. I'll let Kelly comment on both the product revenue growth and the outlook. Yes. I'd say, actually, I think, Rod, I feel like this is a pretty, pretty good guide and actually better theoretically than maybe you guys were expecting. I mean, don't forget, that 6% growth in the midpoint of the guide we gave you, again, excluding SPVSS out of both periods, obviously, is really solid because we have much tougher comparison from a year ago. I mean, we see the strength, and I'm just trying to balance it with there is a lot of unknown depending on what tariffs do. But underlying strength in the macro gives us good confidence. So I feel actually very, very good about the call and... There is one -- there is -- you bring up a good point, which I do want to get out there. Our growth was very, very strong in Q3. And again, back to ASC 606, under new accounting rules, as you know, we have a very strong presence in the Enterprise. Our Enterprise business is going very, very well. Whenever we sign these big, multi-year enterprise agreements, under the new accounting rules, that will accelerate revenue. So in this current Q1, software came in very, very strong. We happen to have 2 very large multi-year enterprise agreements with some large enterprises where, in any one quarter, I might have one, but this was a big one. So that's one additional piece to it. But overall, I'd say all of the underlying fundamentals are very, very positive. And I think these enterprise agreements are actually reflective of what the question Vijay asked. That's a good point. Okay. Thanks, Paul. Thanks for the 4 questions. Just kidding. So Kelly, you'll talk about pricing and everything. Let me give you the broader answer, Paul. I think you're right. And I mean, when you look at our results in -- on an orders perspective and you see emerging countries up 16% in the face of a rising dollar, that's different than what we've seen historically when we were very -- what I would say is we were directly connected to the global GDP, and we move with it. I think maybe this is the beginning of us answering the question that I've been asked the last 2 calls, which is how much of this is macro and how much of it is your own execution. When we began to perform differently than what's perceived to be in the macro, I think that'll give us insight into how much of it is our execution or innovation. The other thing I'd point out is that -- and by the way, in the emerging countries, just to be clear, it was very consistent across the board. So we had incredible strength in -- we do have incredible strength in India. It was our second quarter of 50%-plus growth in India. So we have really done a great job there, and it's not just the large service providers. We had a large Public Sector deal this quarter. So we're -- that is a key market for us that we intend to win in, and the teams are doing a good job there. But I think the other thing to consider is that when you look at our customers even in a tough economic environment, what is one of the things that you want to do when you're in a tough economic environment is you want to continue to drive cost and productivity in your business. And at the heart of the automation strategy and at the heart of some of the SD-WAN stuff and at the heart of rearchitecting the infrastructure, the ending result is to drive cost out and drive productivity up. So it's unclear to me at this point what any sort of significant macro shift is going to do to the spending in this environment because it is connected to what you're trying to achieve when you do have a tough macro environment. So we're going to have to see how it goes. But -- so that's -- that question -- on the Cat 9K, look, we're still incredibly early. I mean, it's incredibly early. We just launched another product that addresses a market size similar to what we launched 1.5 years ago. And so we're just on the front end of it. And as customers adopt that architecture, then you're seeing -- we announced the wireless portfolio that's going to fit within that. In the spring, you'll see SD-WAN get integrated into the overall architecture in addition to the innovation we announced this week. So we feel good about where we are, and we'll see how the macro plays out. And Paul, on the price, we saw, from a rate impact  on price, about 1.9 points down. So slightly up from what it has on the last couple of quarters, but still better than it was, say, in Q1 of '18, but a slight tick-up, 1.9 points. Again, I'll make some color commentary, and I'll let Kelly give you some details there on the numbers. But I think that, for us, Europe has held up in a time where there's been ongoing uncertainty, and I think this shows the resilience that we've seen around the world in the face of a lot of uncertainty. You have Brexit. You've got Italy. You've had elections. You've got Merkel's announcement, and yet we still see continued strength. And we -- it's been pretty consistent for the last, what, Kelly, 4 to 6 quarters, I'd say. It's been fairly consistent growth. So our teams are doing a good job there. I think that we're continuing to execute. And I think that any clarity on any of these issues like Brexit can do nothing but help in my opinion. So Kelly? Yes. No, I'd just say it is very broad-based. I'd say Enterprise is exceptionally strong. So it's -- there is no -- and the U.K. specifically has been pretty good for us over the last, as I said, the last 4 quarters. So I think it does just go back to it's a resilient IT environment. It's Jim Suva. I just have one question, and that is on memory pricing. Can you just remind us of -- the memory pricing was going up, say, the past 12 or 24 months with the actions the company did. And more importantly, what is the strategy going forward as memory pricing appears to have softened? How should we think about that in your strategy or pricing impact to your company? Yes. So the historical -- what we did was memories around DRAM specifically. It was a combination of just prices going up and consistently for all of '17 and '18, and it was a very tight supply. So our strategy was securing supply. We bought inventory ahead. We did everything we could to try to minimize the impact. We had big purchase commitments. And we are still seeing year-over-year price increases. In this quarter, we still are seeing the prices being higher than they were a year ago. The good news is, though, when we look forward, and like I alluded to in the last call, we should see it go from a headwind to a tailwind starting in the second half of our fiscal quarters. So Q3 and Q4, we fully, fully expect the DRAM to be a tailwind for us, which will be good. And this quarter had an impact. There will be less of an impact next quarter, and then we get to goodness. And we did -- much like we're doing with tariffs, we did pass through a lot of the memory costs through price increases over that time as well. I'm on for John Roy. I wanted to focus on the Enterprise orders, which were up 15%, I think the best since 2011. Where is that strength coming from? And are there businesses that are accelerating versus the reported quarter? And maybe, secondly, somewhat related. You called out strength in Service Provider Routing. But Enterprise Routing is a significant portion of your Routing business, and it was down a lot last year after the Viptela acquisition. Now that, that's partly integrated, how's it going? So I would say, if you look at our Enterprise business, it was incredibly consistent globally. It was incredibly consistent across the breadth of our portfolio. I think every product category we had grew in the Enterprise space. And it's largely driven by the strategy in the automation side that we brought forward with this represented in sort of proxy by the Cat 9K from a revenue perspective. We've also -- our team and we talked about this before. Back in Q4 of '18, if you go back to the Q3 call, we said that we felt confident that the SD-WAN solutions would begin to be rolled out in Q4. We saw that, and so we've seen continued adoption of that. And I think with the announcements we made this week with the native integration into our cloud security portfolio that you'll even see that continue. So I think the -- our teams are doing a good job with helping our customers understand the costs and the operational simplicity that they can gain from some of the architectures that we're bringing forward, and I think that's what's driving it. Kelly, any comments on this? Yes. No, I mean, it was across all -- basically, we were up across -- when I look across our businesses, basically just about everywhere. So it was, again, broad-based. Let me get... Go ahead, Kelly. Yes, I'll take the first one on the Service Provider excluding India. I will just say that our Service Provider segment was up in the Americas and EMEA as well. So again, it was... Positive everywhere. It was not driven by India. Though, India had a very strong Service Provider as well. But it was up. Up everywhere. Yes. I would say just a quick characterization on this market, and we've talked about this before. Different customers, different markets are in different phases of their architectural transitions. And we're seeing, in Asia, we had a couple of big wins obviously where we're helping them rearchitect their networks, try to simplify their architectures. And a lot of that is, in some ways, to prepare for 5G. So we're executing better and -- but I think -- I'll still say we've been saying is that we've been doing planning with many of the customers on 5G. I had a call with one CEO today talking about their roll-out plans. So we're actively in the discussions, and our teams are working on architectural designs to accommodate. You're going to see them go into trials. In fact, you've all heard some of the U.S. providers are going into trials in the first quarter of next calendar year. I still believe it'll be calendar 2020 before we see anything -- if we're looking for some broad-based movement. But we'll see how it goes if they move faster, then obviously, we could be a beneficiary of that. But we're staying close to it right now. Yes. So Jeff, my apologies if I misrepresented our 400-gig strategy. I think I said in the script that we were -- in the opening comments that we were absolutely focused on web scale. And I think this does represent an architectural transition that gives nonincumbents the opportunity to insert. So we will look for those opportunities as well. I think when you look at the 400-gig advantages we have, we're bringing forward much like we do with the Nexus. We're going to have a merchant version, and we then have an ASIC-based version we'll be delivering. We have telemetry. We've got optics, security automation, backward and forward compatibility that are going to provide differentiators for us. We're co-chairing some standard boards. We can extend ACI from the private cloud into the public cloud across these. So we think we have a lot of advantages. The teams -- we have the ability to analyze data flows, with security ACI automation policy. So the whole intent-based portfolio that our teams in the Data Center actually introduced years ago, we think will be a big differentiator as well as the breadth of the options that we'll have in the 400-gig space. But we absolutely do see the web scale as an opportunity that we're going to go after here. And on the clarification. So yes, in the January outlook, like I said when I was talking about component costs and memory costs, I still have some bit of a -- I will have still a headwind in Q2 from memory as well as some costs around the MLCCs. And I have an assumption baked in on certainly the tariff costs if they go up to 25% as well as an assumption on what we can offset with the prices pushing through. And so it's all incorporated in the guide I gave you on the gross margin. Yes. So it's the same. I will tell you from an overall perspective. Let's assume they do cut in, in January. Because we will honor quotes. If they have quotes in the system that they took that we haven't taken a order yet, it'll take a while before both the price increase cuts through as well as even when the tariffs do cut in the cost side, we'll bleed through the inventory that has been brought in at the lower costs. So the real full, big impact we'll see, feel when the tariffs go to 25%, if they go to 25%, we'll be in the third quarter. But I have baked in some incremental on both the revenue and the margin side in -- from January. So on the first question on ASC 606, so we will benefit from that going forward. The point I was making earlier was this was a little abnormal this quarter because we had 2 very large enterprise multi-year deals that were very heavy software content that we recognized now -- on the new accounting rules recognized upfront. Just to remind everybody of where we are impacted on mostly from ASC 606. When we have enterprise agreements, whether it is our term-based or not, we will be recognizing them upfront if, basically, the functionality of the software goes to the customer. So a lot of the enterprise agreements we have will all be recognized upfront. Cisco ONE, for example, a lot of that's going to be recognized upfront. And even a portion of our Enterprise Networking like the Cat 9K subscription, a portion of that now will be upfront, even though some is still deferred. So it's accelerating basically big Enterprise license agreements. So this quarter, we had 2 very large ones, but we will be benefiting going forward. And again, it's incorporated in the guide. And overall, long term, it'll be in the 1%, 1.5% kind of range. Yes. I just want to make a comment. When we set out to move to more of a software and subscription model, the real benefit for us is it gives us the opportunity to go in and monetize those licenses again in 3 years. That has not changed. And that was the big benefit. Because if you looked at the way we sold the switch previously, as an example, we would sell a switch with integrated software one time, and perhaps, 5 to 7 years later, we'd go in and try to sell another one. In this model, the underlying ability for us to go in at either the 3-year, the 5-year point, whenever that subscription is up, and renew it, that still exists. This is just an accounting change. So the underlying value to our business is still valid. So we're going to continue to move very hard in this direction. And so on the metrics then here, second question there. So that's why to that point, we think the right metric is looking -- of our software, what percentage is subscriptions, right? And that continues to just increase. And I'll use the Cat 9K as an example. We've talked in the past where we used to sell the previous switch sold for $100, and we recognized $100 upfront. We're selling the Cat before ASC 606, we sold that. Cat 9K for $100, but 25% of it was deferred. And we recognized that 25% over, say, a 3-year term. And then they would renew it for another 3-year term. With ASC 606, that 25% that was deferred, about 12% is now deferred, and other 11 is recognized upfront. But that full 25% is what we renew. And so that's why when you look at the software, that's still subscription software. That's why we think that's the relative metric. We don't think the -- like looking at our deferred revenue, we looked at that in the past. I mean, that was a proxy. But as you saw from our disclosures, we wrote off $1.3 billion of that balance with the adoption all of the new standard for those enterprise agreements and for Cisco ONE. So looking at that isn't as meaningful. And even with the recurring, like using that Cat 9K example, it's not as meaningful. That's kind of why we think using subscriptions, it shows we're still making the transformation. It's shows that we're making progress and have that -- again, nothing has changed with the customer. We still have that stickiness of having that subscription and the ability to continue to build out our offers with them. So let me talk a little bit about the Edge, and I'm going to pile on with a little bit of the cloud, a little bit of discussion around what we see happening with applications in the cloud and some of our announcements, and then we'll talk about the M&A question. So first off, the Edge is incredibly important, and I think that's what's leading us, in many cases, to some of these strategic partnerships that you hear us building with the webscale providers. Some of those are multifaceted where there's an Edge component involved. Because for us to be able to aggregate the data and give the application developers the ability to run microservices at the Edge, that's why we put x86 into our access products so that you can actually run services from within applications out at the Edge and process data as you need to. We've also built some data fabric technologies like Kinetic that are being used by our customers today. Very early days. So we think that what this Edge dynamic does is it gives us the ability to rearchitect the Edge like what you're seeing with SD-WAN. But frankly, it makes the network more relevant in the world that we live in today. Because the traffic flows and where the data is, where the applications are, where your users are, it's all just fundamentally dynamic. And so you have the architect an environment that accommodates for anything, anywhere. And so we think that this is actually good for us over time, and we'll continue to build technology that enables our customers to deal with it. The other thing I want to just talk about relative to this because part of the reason that these webscale partnerships are so important is that we are enabling these developers with things like the Kubernetes solution that we have to actually build applications once and then move them seamlessly between private cloud and public cloud. And we did that with our Google announcement. We've done it with our Amazon announcement. So what I think is going to happen is instead of creating this complex software architecture at the core that is necessary to map applications back and forth, for future apps, they're going to be built on Kubernetes, and we're going to give the customers -- if they want to start on the public cloud, they can seamlessly move them into the private cloud or if they've build in them in the private cloud, they can move them in the public cloud. And with our ACI being extended into the cloud now, customers can actually seamlessly take their policy in an ACI architecture and extend it into any cloud that they like. So we're trying to make that simple, and we think the combination of that and the Edge actually brings the network much more value in the future. Those were the questions? About M&A pipeline. Oh, M&A. Sorry, Jim. We've always said we'll look at any opportunity that arises, if it is strategically aligned and it's good for our fiscally. And I would say that the deals that you've seen done over the last few months have 0 bearing on how we think about it. We continue to look at the opportunities that makes sense for us and our part of our financial plan and makes sense for us in that perspective, and that's how we'll continue to look at it. Okay. So let me address both. The first is that the restructuring that's going on right now is, first of all, it's not an OpEx reduction, and we've -- I've actually taken this issue and talked head on with our employees about what's going on right now very directly. And majority of this is part of the customer experience transition. If you look at what we've done relative to the software portfolio and how we're building out these offers for our customers, any great software company has a very successful customer experience organization. And if you'll recall, we brought in Maria Martinez from Salesforce back in May of this year, and she has been putting together a strategy for how we need to be structured for the future. And this is actually just -- it's an unfortunate step that we needed to take in order to expeditiously get to where we need to be relative to dealing with the renewals and the life cycle that our customers are going to want us to drive with them in this new portfolio. So that's really the predominant driver for what's going on right now. And again, I've been very clear with our employees. We've been very open and transparent with them about what's going on. On the SD-WAN side, I think you're -- it's probably generally accurate, what you described. However, I think that there's been such a stall in the Enterprise routing business for the last couple of years waiting for this to take off that I would view it as a net positive now because we have movement. And you got to remember, many branches are going to -- they're going to leverage SD-WAN technology on top of one of our ISRs anyway. So you're going to see various flavors at the Edge. You're going to see some software only on x86 type platforms all the way up to software running on high-end ISRs because you still need a high-performance branch but you want the flexibility in how you dynamically route your traffic out of that branch. So I view it as a positive. And frankly, I think when you see the Enterprise business, the consistency we've seen over the last few quarters, I think SD-WAN is a big part of that. Just a couple of comments. I think I'll just leave you with I think that our teams are executing incredibly well. There's clearly some uncertainty out there, but I think the macroeconomy has shown a level of resilience that not many people expected. I think that what we're beginning to see and what is coming through here is that while the cloud 4 or 5 years ago was viewed as an existential threat to our business, I fundamentally believe that the cloud and the transition to the cloud that our customers are undergoing is actually driving our growth now. So we feel good about where we are. We feel good about the innovation, and we feel good about our team's execution. Thank you guys for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you, Chuck. Go ahead, Michelle.","I have a bigger-picture question for both of you, if I may, which is the subscriptions model. The promise was to get a higher share of the purchasing dollars, the customers' budgets. Is that starting to happen? Are you starting to see it in your sales figures? And if you could give us any data anecdotes saying, yes, now that we have kind of expanded and extended software subscriptions across the portfolio, you're seeing X percentage more of the customer share of IT spending purchasing dollars would be very helpful. I guess, I wanted to focus in on product revenue growth. It was really strong for the quarter, 9%. I know that's with SPVSS, which, if anything, dragged that down. And then -- so I mean, it feels like you've been pretty conservative in the guidance, and I know you'll probably say, ""No, we aren't."" But I'm just curious what could go better in this guidance, what you're contemplating in terms of elements of conservatism. Can you give us any idea of how you're thinking about that forward quarter right now and how things might go better if, let's say, we do get a trade deal, et cetera? Kelly, I just -- just one comment on that. What I would say -- and I didn't mean that it was disappointing from a guidance point of view. I just meant that you were so strong on growth in the reported quarter. Why not be more, I guess, aggressive with the guidance? That was really what I was asking. Kelly, just 2 quick questions on pricing and the drag from the shift to recurring or does 606 address that? And the bigger question for you and Chuck -- and Chuck, if you can't answer this, I'm hoping you'll answer a different question. But I hear you keep citing the strength of the macro environment. And the thought arises that it's far from even throughout the world. U.S. has been strong, but there are plenty of other places far less so. In fact, I don't think the word strong would apply. And yet your revenue on a very broad base across geos is very strong and far outstripping what we see from a macro perspective. If you can't answer for the disconnect, my question to you would be, how -- what do you think is the time period? I know it's still early in the Catalyst switch architecture upgrade cycle. How far do you think that has to go? Where do you think you are in that process? How much strength is there to come? Kind of the macro question, which is just to focus on your EMEA business. You had a strong quarter there. Which are the countries kind of driving that strength? And as we kind of get to this point where we have some more clarity building around Brexit, how do you -- are you seeing any kind of enterprise customers starting to sort of step -- come off the fences and start to invest a bit more, given that there's now more clarity building around what the eventual deals will look like? My main question has to do with service provider growth in the quarter And you made a comment earlier about India being up 50%. If you were to exclude the India growth in the quarter, would Service Provider be flat to down? Maybe give some perspective on that. And then the second part is, as you think about Service Provider, the Service Provider segment or the customer vertical in next year or 2, are you seeing some customer spend being held back with the onset of 5G spending and deployments coming into the picture? And if we were to see a 5G revenue type of spending deployment or acceleration, where in the next 4 quarter do you think that would start to be very noticeable? Yes, I have a question and a clarification. The question is, on the 400-gig side, I think some of your peers in the space are hoping that this will be an opportunity for them to make insertions into the webscale market. It seems, Chuck, from your language that you're focused primarily on the Enterprise market. So I guess, I'm wondering, if not now for web scale, when? If I have that right. And then, Kelly, maybe on a clarification side. Could you help us understand if you've baked anything into the January outlook or pass-throughs of memory prices or increases in tariffs or what have you? Yes. I'm sorry, Kelly. I meant on the revenue side. The pass-through on tariffs or memory. How much is that? Kelly, one clarification on the question. First on ASC 606, is it just a one-quarter benefit to revenue? Or do you expect any more in Q2 or going forward? And then the question is, you talked a little bit about some of the metrics that you used to give us on the recurring front not being as well as in going forward. Could you give us some more color on that and what sort of metrics that we should focus on and then if you have any targets for those new metrics going forward? Just quick one for me. The Edge is a topic popping up more and more. I guess, what are your thoughts around the move towards a distributed environment? How that will impact Cisco? And what investments are being made to win there? And just secondly, there's been a lot of larger M&A over the last few months. How is Cisco viewing the M&A pipeline today? And if a large enough deal were to come along, would this impact that share buyback plan? I just wanted to ask one quick one and one thematic. On the quick one, there were some press reports about layoffs. And I know Cisco regularly does some pruning. If you could address that. And thematically, I'd like to get an understanding of how you think about the SD-WAN products. You've been in this marketplace for a while now, and it looks like it's getting traction. But my thought is this is a headwind for your router business but a tailwind for the SD-WAN platform. So how do you see this playing out over, let's say, the next several quarters?

CSCO,Q4 2019,2281,4061,1395,"Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing today is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. This guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q4 results marked a strong end to a great year. Our teams executed well through a very dynamic environment. We delivered significant innovation across our entire portfolio, and we continued our business model transition with software subscriptions now at 70% of total software revenue, up 12 points year-over-year. We delivered strong revenue and double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth for the full year and in the fourth quarter. We also continued to generate healthy margins, cash flow and returns for our shareholders. Our technology is fundamentally redefining IT architectures to help our customers manage the complexities of a multicloud world and transform for the future. Let me cover some recent highlights across our portfolio. Starting with Infrastructure Platforms. We continue to see strong performance with broad-based growth across the majority of our portfolio led by our next-generation enterprise networking solutions. Over the last 2 years, we have built the foundation for intent-based networking by rearchitecting our entire networking portfolio to deliver new capabilities through our automation platform. At Cisco Live!, we launched several new technology innovations across networking domains to more effectively secure and manage users and applications across the entire enterprise, from campus networks, in wide area networks to data centers and the IoT Edge. We also added several AI and ML software capabilities to improve network management through automation. A great example of this is our new AI network analytics capability, which delivers greater visibility and insights across the entire enterprise network. In data center, we continue to execute well as we help enable our customers to securely access their applications and their data anywhere from private to public cloud environments as well as at the Edge. We are innovating across every facet of our portfolio, integrating AI, automation, security and assurance into our Nexus switching platforms and our 400-gig offerings. This quarter, we delivered data center network insights, providing critical analytics and proactive network management capabilities through automation to increase our customers' ability to troubleshoot and remediate their environments. We also continue to invest in silicon and optics to build the next-generation Internet for our customers. The recently announced intent to acquire Acacia is a good example of how we are enhancing our silicon and optics portfolio to enable web-scale service provider and data center operator customers to meet today's fast-growing consumer demand for data. Now turning to Security, which had an incredible year. Cybersecurity continues to be the top priority for our customers, driving another consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As the industry leader in networking and cybersecurity, we are investing in and extending our subscription-based security innovations across all networking domains in today's Zero Trust environment. By extending our ability to detect threats across public clouds and by protecting the campus, branch, WAN and data center against threats, we are the only company providing an integrated end-to-end security architecture across multicloud environments. Throughout the year, we've expanded our family of cloud security solutions to help secure identity, end points and the network, which has led to accelerating customer adoption as they move or expand to the cloud. We're also extending this protection from the network to branch offices to roaming users with flexible solutions designed to secure our customers' SD-WAN environments. During the quarter, we were excited to announce the availability of a full web proxy capability on our global SaaS platform, Umbrella, to complement our on-premise appliances. Trust plays a critical role as customers access their networking applications; and identity plays a critical role in delivering a secure, consistent experience no matter how, when or where they connect. This market dynamic was central to our Duo Security acquisition, and we continue to see customer momentum, reflecting the power of Duo's differentiated, market-leading SaaS platform. Moving to applications. Our collaboration business continues to perform well as we execute against our strategy to accelerate the future of work, communications and collaboration. Earlier this year, we shared our vision for cognitive collaboration, which we believe is quickly becoming the foundation to deliver massively personalized experiences and transform how we work. We are leading the market in integrating AI and ML into our enterprise collaboration portfolio, bringing intelligence and context to help our customers work smarter and increase productivity. Through our AI-driven innovations like people insights, facial recognition and WebEx Assistant, we're driving expanded collaboration experiences on any device integrated with our customers' business process workflows. Building on these cognitive innovations, we announced our intent to acquire Voicea, a market-leading provider of voice-based artificial intelligence solutions. With Voicea's technology, we will enhance our entire WebEx portfolio with a powerful transcription service combining AI and automated speech recognition to enable more actionable meetings, improved productivity and enhanced experiences. We also achieved another outstanding quarter of growth with our AppDynamics, demonstrating rapid customer adoption of our differentiated end-to-end visibility and analytics platform from the end user to the network to the application. In summary, we had a great quarter and finish to fiscal year 2019, and I'm proud of what our teams have accomplished. We are executing well in a time of uncertainty, delivering differentiated innovation across our portfolio and extending our market leadership in enterprise networking applications and security. Our performance reflects our relevance as well as the ongoing value we're providing our customers as they transform for the future. We are as committed as ever to providing them with the right innovation to drive greater impact and success. As I look ahead, I could not be more confident about our unique position in the market and the tremendous opportunity in front of us. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter then cover the full fiscal year followed by the guidance for Q1. Q4 was a great quarter across the business. We executed well with strong revenue growth, margins, net income and EPS. Total revenue was $13.4 billion, up 6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.6%, up 1.4 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 9%. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.83, up 19%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7% to $10.1 billion. Infrastructure Platforms grew 6%. All of the businesses were up with the exception of routing. Switching had a great quarter with double-digit growth driven by both campus and data center with the continued ramp of the Cat 9K and strength of the Nexus 9K. We saw solid growth in wireless across the portfolio. Data center was up with growth in both HyperFlex and servers. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. Applications was up 11% with Collaboration, AppDynamics and IoT software all up double digits. Security was up 14% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat, unified threat and web security. Service revenue was up 4% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 70% of total software revenue, up 12 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year-over-year, there was a 60 basis point positive impact on revenue. In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders growth was flat. Looking at our geographies, Americas was up 1%, EMEA was up 4% and APJC was down 8%. Total emerging markets was down 8% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 20%. In our customer segments, enterprise was down 2%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 13% and service provider was down 21%. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q4 was $25.3 billion. RPO is our deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred and represents total committed, noncancelable future revenue. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 65.5%, up 2.3 points. Product gross margin was 64.7%, up 2.8 points. And service gross margin was 67.9%, up 0.7 points. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q4 net income was $2.2 billion, and EPS was $0.51. The GAAP results include a charge of approximately $900 million, which is a reversal of a tax benefit recorded in Q4 fiscal year '18, which relates to new U.S. treasury regulations issued during the quarter related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $33.4 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.9 billion, down 4%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $6 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $4.5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. In our Q2 fiscal '18 earnings call, we said we would return $31 billion through share repurchases over the following 18 to 24 months. As of Q4 fiscal '19, we completed that commitment with share repurchases of $32.6 billion. Going forward, we will return to our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q4, we announced our intent to acquire Acacia, an existing supplier that is focused on optical interconnect technologies. This move is consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. I'll now cover the full fiscal year results. We delivered strong revenue growth, margins, net income, EPS and operating cash flow. Revenue was $51.7 billion, up 7%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6%, up 0.3 points. And our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.3%, up 0.7 points. From a bottom line perspective, non-GAAP net income was $13.8 billion, up 9%. And non-GAAP EPS was $3.10, up 20%. GAAP net income was $11.6 billion, and GAAP EPS was $2.61. We delivered operating cash flow of $15.8 billion, up 16%. Normalized for the tax payments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in each fiscal year and the cash received in Q1 fiscal '19 related to the legal settlement with Arista, operating cash flow was up 8%. To summarize, we had a strong Q4 and fiscal year. We executed well with strong top line growth and profitability, and we're seeing the returns in the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. 	Note that we have normalized our first quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q1 fiscal '19, which we divested on October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call. We expect revenue growth in the range of 0% to 2% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%, and non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. The 1% increase in tax rate over fiscal '19 is primarily due to a forecasted decrease in tax benefits from foreign income. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. I'll turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions)","Rod, thanks for the question. So let me start by saying, first of all, the strategy and the work that we've done on our portfolio and the engagement with our customers is absolutely going in the right direction. And we continue to make progress, and the strategy is working. So we're quite happy with what our teams have accomplished and where we are right now in that space. There's a couple of things that we saw in the quarter, and I'll outline these and I'll answer, Rod, your question about the enterprise. First is we had continued challenges in service provider, and I'll double click on that in just a moment, as you saw in the order growth that Kelly talked about. And then we did see in July some slight early indications of some macro shifts that we didn't see in the prior quarter. So those are the 2 things that happened. Let me double click on service provider just a bit. The Americas was generally the same from an order perspective from the prior quarter, so no real shift, positive or negative. Europe was actually positive in the SP space. And Asia, we saw continued weakening in our China service provider business. And we had 2 massive build-outs in India a year ago that just didn't replicate this year with the 2 major players there. That's the net of the service provider situation. It's not more complicated than that. If you look at our overall business, our orders outside of service provider grew mid-single digits. So we feel good in this environment about the rest of the portfolio and the work that we're doing with those customers. As it relates to commercial enterprise and public sector, and I'm going to probably give you a little more granularity than normal just so you understand what we believe went on, you can see that the portfolio that is being sold into all 3 of those segments is obviously being well received. Our public sector business on a global basis was up 13%, so we continue to see success. And as you mentioned, Rod, global commercial was up 7%. The enterprise business was really -- we saw weakness in China, which was -- contributed to it. We saw some weakness in the U.K. in enterprise. And then candidly, in the U.S., as much as I don't want to use compares for an excuse, we had 2 major software deals a year ago that were tough to compare against. So that's really it. The rest of the business and everything that we see is still very positive, and we feel good about where we are. Yes. And Rod, on your backlog question. So we have -- since we adopted ASC 606, we've been disclosing our RPO, which is a more meaningful metric of our future revenue because, again, the problem with our backlog, it didn't include our subscription businesses. So it didn't include anything on Collaboration or Security. So RPO has everything. It has the deferred revenue, the unbilled deferred and any committed future revenue. And like we've disclosed in our Qs, we expect -- of that $25.3 billion, we expect about 56% of that to be recognized over the next 12 months. Yes. Let me just comment on the China situation. I mean you're right. It's down below 3%. It's a small part of our business. But obviously, when it falls very dramatically, it can still have some impact because it is greater than 0. But long term, it's not a concern that I worry about much at this point. And so that's really the extent of what we saw there. I mean the China reduction contributed to a point of the issue in all of enterprise for us, so it was that significant. And we definitely saw significant impact on our business in China as it relates to what's going on with trade war right now. Yes. And then Paul, on your margin question. So yes, pricing, the environment stays good. Actually, we had a very good quarter on pricing. It was less than 1 point that you'll see when we give you the Q. So that's been very good. And again, you can see we are benefiting in our gross margins and OMs from the tailwind from DRAM as we expected. And you're seeing that in not only the results but also as we've been guiding on the margin. You obviously give us year-over-year order growth number every quarter, but I wonder if you could give us a sense of what the sequentials look like versus historical seasonality. If I have my math right, sequential order growth looks somewhat in line with seasonality, but your revenue guide is a tad below where you've grown sequentially in recent years. So I just want to confirm that's right. And then secondly, you're coming off a strong year of 7% revenue growth. I know you don't guide for the year, but investor expectations were somewhat high, and I wonder if you could comment even qualitatively on how to think about full year revenue growth. Tejas, so yes, you're right on our sequentials on orders. I mean we've had this phenomena -- it's not a phenomena, but our Q4 always has a double-digit growth, and Q4 is our largest quarter from a dollar perspective on orders growth for us. So that happens. And again, in Q1, it's a double-digit down. So this -- the sequential isn't a change from historical, and again, the year-over-year takes into account the kind of the phenomenon we're seeing now. In terms of the long-term guide, again, we don't give more than 1 quarter. I would say, to Chuck's earlier point, in terms of how we feel about the portfolio and the margins and the update, we feel good about that. The macro and the certain segment issues like in SP, I mean I think that -- I don't foresee that -- I'm not planning on that changing in the near term. Sami, thanks. It's a great question. So in the last 120 to 180 days, I mean we completed the full refresh of our portfolio across switching, routing and wireless in the enterprise, and we're now in a position where all of those have mandatory subscriptions. So we've made that transition from a product development perspective, and now those are all out in the marketplace with our customers. On the Catalyst 9000, Q4 was the -- we added more customers in Q4 for the Catalyst 9000 than in any quarter prior. So that continues to move forward favorably. In the campus, what I would suggest to you is that we're -- I'd say maybe we're in the second inning at this point of this transition that we see from our customers. As you know, they're all rearchitecting their entire enterprise infrastructure to accommodate these traffic flows that are presented from the massive number of cloud applications that they're running. And so it requires a completely different architecture, which is what this portfolio is built for. As it relates to data center, I think that next year, you'll probably begin to see some upgrades transitions when the pure 400-gig optics are available. And one of the things that we believe is a big differentiator for us is that we're extending this policy management out of the data center into the campus, from a campus into the wide area, from the wide area into the cloud security portfolio. So we think being able to enable our customers to deliver policy from the data center all the way across the campus to the branch into the cloud is a very unique differentiator for us, and we think we'll begin to see customers adopting and deploying that sometime in the next year as well. So that's how we see it playing out. Tal, can you speak up just a little bit? Yes. Yes. That's better. Tal, I'll take a crack at it. I mean at the end of the day, when we are guiding, it's based on what we're seeing with the orders alone, the pipeline and everything else. And the biggest driver of the guide where it is, is the massive decline we've seen in service provider over the last 2 quarters. So that is the biggest driver. Again, like Chuck said, we feel good about the rest of the portfolio from an orders perspective growing in the mid-single digits. But -- China is part of it, but again, like we said, it's small in comparison. But SP is still a large part of the business, and that's driving this outlook that you're seeing. What we're talking about for that is for the orders rate that we just had -- the orders rate for enterprise being down 2 points, 1 point of that at the global level was attributed just to China alone. China overall was down over 25% this quarter for us. Yes. Let me just give you color and then Kelly can give you some numbers. I mean Tal, the overall Chinese market, as I said earlier, is certainly not a major play for us, but it has just dropped precipitously in light of the trade discussions. So it has a short-term impact. And where we are selling, for years, we've sold infrastructure to the large carriers in China, which has just -- it's been slowly declining, and we saw it even decline more rapidly last quarter. And then what we've seen is in the state-owned enterprises anymore, we're just being -- we're being uninvited to bid. We're not being allowed to even participate anymore. So those are the enterprises. That's where the large impact was this past quarter. So it was just a much faster decline of what we candidly expected. Yes. And I would just add to that. So again, we talked about the big impact. Enterprise had a -- it was the second largest -- was down in service provider, which is part of our overall service provider being down. But from a product perspective, we sell everything there, from switches, routers, all the way down through security and Meraki products. So we sell everything including cloud in China, and everything is being impacted. Chuck and Kelly, you've been very clear about the softness in revenues when -- for the outlook. When you think about the outlook, and a lot of it seems to be service provider, a softness, that has not been a new theme. You've talked about it for the past several quarters. So where we sit today looking out, is there a lot of risk that it could get worse? Or are you kind of looking at this saying we're kind of near a bottom for service provider trends because it's been chugging along pretty low and they're starting to sweat their assets potentially? Or is there still some risk that you have there? Just kind of thinking about the service provider headwinds of could it get worse or is it you looking at it and saying, ""Hey, we're calling for a bottom."" Look, I think that when you get into this area, there's certainly pressure in the business models across all different types of service providers. I think that if you look at the early 5G build-outs, most of the telco customers we have, particularly in Americas, they're focused on the consumer 5G trials today. They're not -- I mean that is the primary focus and then getting their 5G consumer networks built out. But they also don't, I would say, don't anticipate that being a huge profit driver off of the 5G transition. That's going to come when they build a more robust, broader 5G infrastructure where they'll deliver enterprise services. And that's going to come after they do the consumer side. So it's a bit unclear when that will take place. I'd say we are not modeling and don't anticipate any significant improvement in this business in the very near term. And we're just going to have to wait and see. It's been a tough business for us for years. And it's now -- it obviously represents a much smaller percentage of our business than it did 5 years ago. But it clearly was a major point of weakness for us in the last quarter. Do you want add anything to that, Kelly? I think you got it. Great. I just had a couple of questions, one related to gross margins and one to the deferred revenue. On gross margins, Kelly, it looks like even though the August -- I'm sorry, the July quarter was very good is that you're guiding for -- on both to be -- gross margins to be flat to down a little bit. And sequentially, historically, we've seen at least some improvements. So I'm wondering if you can help parse a little bit what's maybe going on there. And my second question is deferred revenue actually looks quite good. So can you give us some insight into how much of that may be ELAs or software or other aspects so we can get a little bit more color on what's driving the deferred revenue? Sure. So on the margin, yes, I mean I'd say the margins are going great. We feel good about it. I kept the range in that 64% to 65% to take into account the cutting in of List 4 of the tariffs. Again, we're going to run the same play that we have for all the other tariffs, and we'll be -- again, we continue to mitigate, we continue to do everything we can do. But we see that in that range, which I think is pretty good. And as you look -- as that falls down through OM, we're actually doing well and have actually raised a little bit on the OM guide. So again, I think we're able to offset the headwinds from tariffs with, again, continued benefit from the software, which leads to your point on the deferred revenue. Yes. I mean again, we continue to add to deferred revenue, which again is why I think -- look at that RPO as a key metric, which has both the deferred revenue as well as unbilled deferred. When you have month-to-month contracts, it shows the progress we've made. Just to remind you guys, when we adopted ASC 606 at the beginning of the fiscal year, we wrote off $2.8 billion from our deferred revenue balance for the new accounting rules. And again, you're seeing just big sequential increases. Since then, as we discontinue to ramp the portfolio with like, for example, the entire enterprise portfolio, that all has subscriptions. So it's broad-based. We continue to have great adoption of the new products, all the subscriptions, we have great adoption of the ELAs. We had really strong performance of software in ELAs in Q4. So it's all going in the right direction, which is -- again, that's why we're still -- despite any macro environment, why we're still bullish on the overall strategy of the company on what we're doing on the transformation. Yes. James, if I might add to that. I know -- like 3 years ago, I think I made a comment on one of the earnings calls that I felt like we had figured out how we could drive our subscription business on top of networking products. And now here we are, and we've got every product in our portfolio in the enterprise network now that has mandatory subscription. And we really started selling that 2 years ago. So the first renewal window was really still a year away. So the team has done a great job. That transition has been good. We're on track with what we told everyone in the Financial Analyst Conference, where we'd be relative to our software. And I think that's what you're seeing show up in the RPO metrics as well. Yes. Thanks, Tim. So basically, we just felt a slight difference in July, I mean relative to the close rates and just -- it just wasn't as strong a finish as we would normally expect, particularly in Q4. And I think that's what kind of set off the flags for Kelly and I. I met with 17 customers in the last 5, 6 business days, and nothing's changed about how they're thinking about the role of technology and what we do and how we're playing there. So we're monitoring this. We're watching it. We'll see. Obviously, I think what we've seen in the markets in the last few weeks and what we hear from some of the other players would indicate that others have seen similar things, some a lot worse. And I do feel very good about our position and where we are and the level of criticality that we are playing with our customers now versus 5, 6 years ago. And I think that -- so I feel good about that piece. But that's really what we felt, and we'll just have to see how it plays out and whether we get any resolution on some of these major geopolitical issues that are sort of lingering out there. I've said for like 18 months that I've been amazed at the resilience of the economy. And hopefully, it can bounce back pretty quick if we get to some -- get more clarity on some of these issues, which I think people are just -- I think they're just hedging their bets relative to some resolution on some of the stuff. And then the second question was around the 400 gig and our own -- yes, I'll tell you, we have -- I feel good about it, number one. We're in the game. We have our technology road maps mapped out. Our teams have made these acquisitions, which allows us to have good control of our components that go into these products. We've talked to lots of customers, including the web-scale providers who are very supportive of where we're headed and what we're doing. They're supportive of the strategy. They like the acquisitions. And so we feel good that we'll be in a good place -- in a much better position to compete in this transition than we were last time around. So I feel good about where we are. Yes. Simon, I think the way you're looking at -- I mean again, we don't guide, and again, there's a lot of unknown out there. But I'll say the way you're thinking about it is probably the right way. I think the way you're thinking about the second half -- certainly, you get more normalized, compares on that in the second half. But I think the way you're looking at it is very rational. Yes. Simon, we stopped -- when we -- we stopped this fiscal year on that when we adopted 606 because a lot of our recurring subscriptions like, for example, DNA with the Cat 9K, because of the accounting, it changes how we have to recognize it. So that's why, really, the metric that we talk about now is how much of our software revenue is subscription-based. So recurring isn't that meaningful. Yes. Sure. Yes. So on the probability, on OM, I think it's not magic, right? It is -- we're working the gross margins hard with -- like we talked earlier. And then we're also working the OpEx side hard as always as well. Our engineering teams do a really good job of rebalancing their portfolios and making sure they're investing in the right stuff, and we are constantly driving for efficiency. So it's good old-fashioned running the business and executing well despite the top line. So that's how that's happening. And then on the capital allocation, yes, so if you go back to when we did tax reform back in Q2 of '18 and we announced the big buyback, we had a $31 billion authorization then and we said we'd use that $31 billion. We did effectively use that up through the -- up till now, the 18 months. And so now since we've really gotten our balance sheet where we want it in terms of we reduced our debt, we've brought our cash balance from $74 billion back then now to $33 billion, we've reduced our debt from $35 billion down to $25 billion, we're going to get back to our normal strategy, which is being very opportunistic when our stock's down like on days like today and buying, but really balancing between both the dividends and the buyback to be at least 50% of our free cash flow. Yes. I think one thing that is, I think, important to look at is when we talk about enterprise spending and when many companies talk about enterprise spending, that would be, in some cases, a combination at a minimum of our enterprise and commercial business. And in some cases, people would just include public sector in there, in that sort of a view. And that -- when you put it all together, it was actually quite healthy. The orders were quite healthy. We just had a little bit in July of a feel that -- we just didn't close as strong as we would like. And so we felt like there was even more that we could have done, and it just didn't feel like a normal Q4 finish. And it felt a little bit like some of the macro issues may be manifesting themselves. So that's really what we saw there. And then Kelly, you want to talk about the software and the... Yes. I mean again, just on the software, I think, again because more and more -- and again, even despite, like I talked about, the write-off of deferred revenue -- the adoption of 606, even despite that, the amount of revenue -- software revenue coming off the balance sheet continues just to grow as we put more on the balance sheet. So that helps buffer when you do go through any tough macro issues. So I think we'll continue to add to that, and it'll continue to help soften whenever there is any kind of macro slowdowns. But it's helping maintain kind of the growth that we do see as well as margins. Sorry. I'm sorry. Yes. I think that what Amy and the team have been doing is really -- they've been refreshing new elements of the portfolio with end units, end points. They've been -- they've consolidated the -- to a single-user interface. We've got new refreshed versions of WebEx out there. They're bringing the cognitive capabilities in. There's a lot of new technology that they've been bringing. So I think they're in the midst of delivering on that right now. And the results in that business would suggest that our customers are viewing it favorably because it continues to perform really well for a decent-sized business. So I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. Look, we're 4 years in, and I'm really proud of what our teams have accomplished. I mean we've come a long way in 4 years, and I don't actually judge where we are based on this quarter, I think -- or the quarterly guidance. I think that what we've built in the portfolio and the innovation and the value that we're bring to our customers is sustaining, and we'll continue to do that with our customers going forward. We have a strong record of our execution. I have high conviction in the portfolio, and I think we're well positioned for long-term growth opportunities. So thanks all of you for spending time with us today, and thanks for the questions. All right. Thanks, Chuck. So Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2020 first quarter results, will be on Wednesday, November 13, 2019, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations group, and we thank you very much for joining today.","I guess I'm going to ask the obvious one and then maybe -- perhaps a little bit of detailed color, if I can get it. The guidance says weaker than, I think, we had anticipated. We know it's a tough macro environment. So just hoping, Chuck, that you would maybe comment on that. And maybe juxtapose the change in trend in enterprise orders, which did weaken quite a bit with commercial, which seems to be holding up fine and kind of why that is going on. And then Kelly, if you could comment on backlog as well. I know you guys usually give it in the K, so it'd be great to get that number as well. Just to follow up on Rod's question, Chuck, a clarification. I thought China was now down or have been down for a while still well less than 3% of revenue. And I guess it's not 0, so you still have exposure. But I'm surprised it impacted you to the extent you suggested. And then I want to ask Kelly about the pricing environment. I assume there's been a change in what we should expect for margins throughout the year. I assume they're going up on both the gross and the operating line given DRAM and given the shift to -- ongoing shift to software while in a benign pricing environment. But if you could comment on that. I was hoping you could kind of just give us an update on the campus switching refresh and then perhaps maybe your view on where we'll be next year as you see the campus switching cycle playing out and maybe even potentially more consistent data center switching deployments play out, especially since we're going through some transitions in the industry. So I guess what I really just want to understand is where we are in the cycle. Where -- are we in like the fifth, maybe sixth, maybe even first or second inning the way you see it? And then maybe the equivalent of where we see that for data center switching for your customers. If you look at the growth this quarter, it's about 1%. And then a few quarters ago, you were... Yes. Can you hear me? I'll pick it up. Here you go. Now it's better. This quarter -- you're guiding for 1% growth. A few quarters ago, you reported 8%, but you had roughly organically growing -- you were growing about 4% to 4.5%. Can you take the 1% that you have now and then build on top of it all the things that you're seeing today to see what's the growth environment now that is more sustainable going forward? I'm trying -- I have difficulties to go from 4%, 4.5% to 1% within like 3 quarters. And if it's not a major deceleration in the growth environment, what could it be? So you mentioned China. What are the other things that are happening today that are unique to Q1 that are bringing the growth down so much from the levels we have seen just a few quarters ago? So what's the -- can you quantify this? Can you quantify what is the decline in the growth related to service providers? And I think you mentioned 1 point is related to China, am I correct? Got it. And if I can just have a follow-up on China. We always felt that you're not selling much in China, that it's hard to compete in China. Where are you -- where did you have position in China? I know you were selling some routers to service providers. But where are you selling in China? And what's being impacted in China? What are the types of products that you're selling into the Chinese market? Yes. Just to follow up on another question, if I could. Chuck, you mentioned a little bit of the weakness was also related to some macro shifts in the month of July. Could you talk a little bit about that, kind of what we're seeing? Was the deals pushing out, scaling down, more competition, anything like that? And then you also mentioned the move to 400-gig upgrades next year. Can you talk a little bit about how you think Cisco will fare in these data center deals as we move to 400 gig? And the strategy to take in-house and develop more optics internally, do you think that helps as early as that 400-gig transition? I know you don't want to guide beyond the quarter, but maybe if you could help us sort of level set how to think about the year given that I think you're facing a pretty tough comparison in October, and so guiding 0% to 2% seems to set a new level. But if I just apply normal seasonality through the balance of the year, it would look like the year-over-year growth rate should come back somewhat in the January through July quarters. I just want to see how we should think about, really, the full fiscal year trending. And just a quick -- do you have a metric for percent of revenue that's recurring? I think you've given it in the past. And now with the fiscal year over, hope you maybe have that number. Kelly, you had mentioned a little earlier that you're taking the operating margin up a shade. I'm wondering if you could comment about how you are making the magic happen there in light of a little bit of a lower revenue trajectory than we all might have hoped for a few months ago. And then just to clarify, your capital return plan sounds like it's going to be mostly about the dividends here rather than buybacks going forward. I just wanted to follow up on the guidance that you guys mentioned, the service provider weakness is kind of what's driving the weakness in the guide, although there seems to be a broader concern here from investors related to a slowdown in the enterprise spending. So just wanted to get your thoughts, particularly given the change in the business towards kind of higher software subscription mix, how should we think about levers you can pull to drive growth even if enterprise spending does kind of see a slowdown next year? And just a quick follow-up. At Cisco Live!, the team had talked about a major refresh of the Collaboration portfolio. So I just wanted to see what the early response to that refresh has been. Sorry, anything about on the Collaboration portfolio?

CSCO,Q2 2019,2216,4179,1336,"Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q2 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, we again demonstrated that we have built a resilient growth engine that is firing on multiple cylinders. Our strategy of expanding our portfolio while investing in our core markets is delivering unprecedented innovation for our customers and sustainable value for our shareholders. We delivered revenue growth across all geographies and businesses, strong margins, double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth and continued solid cash generation. We're building the technologies that enhance our customers' new digital capabilities and experiences like never before. With the continued expansion to the cloud, the increasing connectivity of users and devices and the need to secure their enterprises, our customers are facing the most complex and dynamic IT environment we've ever seen. Cisco's intent-based networking architecture helps them navigate this complexity by enabling them to simplify, automate and securely transform their infrastructure. We are redefining every networking domain for our customers, from the campus to the wide area network, to the data center, to the cloud, delivering the agility, operational efficiency and, most importantly, the security our customers require to accelerate their digital transformations. Only Cisco can build and deliver a multi-domain, intent-based architecture that sits at the intersection of users, devices, applications and data, that can securely connect any user on any device, on any network to any application. Simply put, the Cisco of today is at the center of our customers' strategies and no longer viewed just as an enabler of those strategies. Now let's review some of the highlights in our key strategic growth areas. Starting with Infrastructure Platforms. Over the last 18 months, we've been reinventing networking from the ground up to connect every domain of the extended enterprise. And it's clear that the investments we've made in our core business are paying off. We are executing well with continued growth in our infrastructure portfolio and strong customer uptake of our Catalyst 9000 family of switches and our SD-WAN offerings. We are now extending our industry-leading security and intent-based networking capabilities to new IoT Edge platforms, connecting devices throughout the enterprise with unprecedented scale, unparalleled flexibility and control. Going forward, you'll see us continue to extend our intent-based networking innovations across the portfolio with subscription-based offers that will enable our customers to adopt a consistent architecture across every domain. In the Data Center, we are enabling digital enterprises to securely access their applications and their data everywhere, from private to public cloud environments as well as the Edge. Two weeks ago, we announced a new architecture that extends the data center to wherever the data exists and across all applications running anywhere. We introduced several new innovations to extend our multi-cloud leadership with ACI Anywhere, HyperFlex Anywhere and cloud center capabilities. We're also well positioned to take advantage of 100-gig and 400-gig upgrade cycles across enterprise data centers, service provider and web-scale networks. With global Internet traffic expected to increase threefold over the next 5 years, our customers are facing an exponential demand for capacity. To address their need for speed and performance, we continue to innovate to drive the industry's transition to next-generation high-speed networks of 400 gig and beyond. Our acquisition of Luxtera will further augment our existing capability around silicon and optics, enabling our customers to build the fastest and most efficient networks. Now moving to our Security business. We generated strong double-digit growth, reflecting the increasing demand for our market-leading solutions and the trust our customers place in us. The attack surface is only increasing, and our comprehensive approach of integrating security into the intent-based architecture from the network to the cloud to the endpoint has been successful as our installed base continues to grow. With our industry-leading threat intelligence, we are redefining how security is delivered with our multi-domain architecture. For example, as a leader in both SD-WAN and security, Cisco provides the most robust SD-WAN platform integrated with cloud security. This helps to simplify and secure our customers' deployment, operation and management of their environments. Increasingly, we are helping to secure our customers' distributed enterprises with remote access and cloud-based security solutions. A great example of this is Duo Security's cloud-delivered, zero-trust platform, which significantly expands our footprint in the identity and access market, bringing together user, device and application visibility and trust. We are seeing strong traction with Duo and good progress in scaling their capabilities while strengthening our cloud-based subscription portfolio. Turning to applications. In Collaboration, enterprise communications continue to evolve as we move to a digital, cloud-based world. We are defining the future of work with next-generation collaboration platforms that have flexible, intuitive and intelligent on-premise and cloud-based solutions. This comprehensive approach to collaboration is a key reason why customers are adopting our market-leading portfolio, resulting in another quarter of exceptional growth. Cisco provides a full suite of collaboration solutions for calling, meeting, team collaboration and care with flexible subscription offerings designed to easily integrate into customer workflows. With the deep integration of BroadSoft with our core capabilities, we are now the market leader for cloud-based calling and care solutions with compelling solutions for SMBs as well as enterprises globally. AppDynamics is the largest APM vendor providing real-time analytics and insights across applications, infrastructure and the network, driving solid momentum with our customers. We have been investing in several new capabilities delivering the broadest application visibility and monitoring platform in the world. Our real-time analytics and monitoring offerings are mission-critical for our customers as they face a growing, complex application environment. To simplify and automate their IT operations, we recently launched AIOps, leveraging AI, machine learning and automation to enable improved customer experiences and greater business performance. In summary, we are very pleased with our strong quarter and first half performance. Our teams are executing incredibly well, aggressively transitioning to a software model and accelerating our pace of innovation, and I'm proud of the work they are doing. Our multi-domain, intent-based architecture is helping to simplify, automate and secure the complex IT environments our customers are facing, and I believe we are well positioned to play an even more strategic role in them as they embrace multi-cloud, Edge computing and digital transformation. The innovation our teams have been driving has now given us the strongest portfolio that we've had in a very long time, and I couldn't be more confident about our future. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3. Q2 was a solid quarter across the business. We executed well with strong orders, revenue growth, margins, EPS and operating cash flow. We had continued momentum in product orders, which grew 8%. Total revenue was $12.4 billion, up 7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.1%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.3 billion, up 6%. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.73, up 16%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was up 9% to $9.3 billion. Infrastructure Platforms grew 6%. Switching had another great quarter with double-digit growth in the campus, driven by the continued ramp of the Cat 9K. Wireless also had double-digit growth with the strength of our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. We also saw a decline in Data Center servers, partially offset by strength in hyperconverged. Applications was up 24% with growth across all the businesses. We saw strong growth in Unified Communications, TelePresence and AppDynamics. Security was up 18% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat. Service revenue was up 1%, driven by Software and Solution Support. We continue to transform the business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 65% of total software revenue, up 10 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q2 results year-over-year, there was 140 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw strong momentum in Q2 with total products orders growing 8%. Looking at the geographies. Americas grew 7%, EMEA was up 11% and APJC was up 6%. Total emerging markets was up 6%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 2%. In our customer segments, enterprise was up 11%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 18% and service provider was down 1%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 64.1%. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was $2.8 billion and EPS was $0.63. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $40.4 billion. Q2 operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, down 7%. We paid $750 million for the first transition tax payment related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Normalized for that tax payment, operating cash flow was up 12%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today, we also announced a $0.02 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, up 6% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 3% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program. This raises the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $24 billion. This dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Luxtera, a company focused on silicon photonics, which closed on February 6. To summarize, we had a great Q2. We executed well, with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, driving long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal '19. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Note again that we have normalized our third quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q3 of fiscal '18, which we divested on October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call. We expect revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31% to 32%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.78. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move to Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions) I'll now turn it over to you, Michelle, to start the queuing process.","When we look at a couple of dynamics, whether it be tariffs, government shutdown or maybe even weather for installation and shipping your product around the whole U.S., any thoughts around how we should think about those items, how they played out and in your forecast of what's built in? Jim, this is Chuck. Look, first of all, I would tell you that we -- it certainly is one of the more complex macro, geopolitical environments that I think we've seen in quite a while with all the different moving parts. But to be honest, from the first day of the quarter to the last day of the quarter, we saw 0 difference. We saw very steady demand throughout the quarter and just saw great execution by our teams. When we look out ahead at the guide, there's -- we're looking at the conditions as they exist today. And so far, we've been able to navigate all the different dynamics, I think, pretty well. We're pretty proud of what the teams have accomplished. Thanks, Vijay, and thanks for the nice comment. If I look at the different acquisitions, if you look at, let me just pick a few, like BroadSoft and the integration that's been done with the Collaboration portfolio, that clearly enhances the overall architecture and, I would say, has a positive impact on the total business. As you look at things like Meraki and as we continue to do tighter integration between our -- the Meraki portfolio and the classic Cisco portfolio and we bring together the automation strategies on each side, it gives customers the ability to deploy a hybrid model with both of those technology areas, which I think is a benefit that many of our customers have. They might want the traditional Cisco portfolio in their core headquarters buildings, and they might like Meraki out in their retail outlets or in small branches. So that's very positive. When you think about an acquisition like Duo, that's clearly part of an overarching security architecture that, clearly, our customers are buying into, as you can see from the 18% growth, which is like the fastest growth rate we've seen in Security in many years. So it's -- I think it depends on the acquisition, but most of them are pulling forward an architecture that they're associated with. And just to add, I think we're also embedding it in our products, right? And you can look at like when we acquired Stealthwatch, it's now part of what we're doing with the Cat 9K; or what we announced with Umbrella being in part of other products. So I think it's a combination of both. Yes. And bringing together like some of the traditional technologies -- I mean, thinking about bringing together ISR with Viptela, with Umbrella, to create this new secure SD-WAN offering, I mean, that's a unique capability that only we have. And look at taking some of the security technologies like advanced malware and moving them into the Meraki portfolio, and those are obviously key differentiators for us. Yes. I would tell you -- I think, first of all, it's important to understand the dynamics of the shutdown that we experienced. It was really -- only about 25% of the government agencies were impacted. And some of the groups that we do business with, when they had a sense the shutdown might be coming, some of them pulled some orders ahead and actually got them in the system. So I will tell you that we saw minimal impact. Our U.S. federal business, even with the shutdown, grew double digits, which is, I think, a testament to our team and the relationships and the execution. And so -- and around the world, when you look at our business in Europe, I mean, you look at the -- I mean, think about the 11% growth in EMEA. When we talk to our team there, a lot of that is public sector oriented, same across the world. We just saw -- obviously, at 18% growth in our public sector business around the world, that's obviously -- the technology is resonating in that vertical. That's for sure. Rod, I think that as I think about the enterprise and you look at our portfolio right now, we really line up with -- whether our customers are looking to strategies to drive revenue and looking at how our collaboration architecture or our location analytics in retail outlets can help them, or they're looking at how do they reduce their operating expenses and simplify and the automation we're driving in the networking space, the SD-WAN solutions, they're just -- these are all really core to what our enterprise customers are looking for. And we've talked about over the last several calls that this Cat 9K, the early phases of that, we're still in the very early innings. And now we've deployed a wireless portfolio that fits within that architecture, the SD-WAN solutions are going to be integrated into that architecture. And the customers are still on the very front end of deploying all this technology. So we feel good about where we are. And we think that assuming we continue to execute well on that technology and that portfolio, the benefits to the customer are such that I think that we should have a pretty successful run ahead of us in our enterprise accounts, assuming we continue to execute. Yes. So just on the cash, there's nothing extraordinary in that. And again, that $750 million that we paid out, that's -- we'll be paying that -- those charges escalates in the later years over the next 8 years, right? That was just part of that transition tax. Besides that, no, there's no extraordinary. Remember, in Q1, we had the extraordinary $400 million payout from Arista, but there's nothing in Q2 besides that. Paul, to your question on price. This quarter, it was a 1 point impact on gross margin. Teams did a good job on that. And so that's in that range. And then if I go back to the gross margin drivers, like we talked about on last earnings call, it's been the same drivers, right? We still had a definitely negative headwind for the last quarter here in Q2 from DRAM and component costs. But as you look in our guide forward, you'll notice that the guide went up another 0.5 point because, like I expected last quarter and what we're seeing, the DRAM turns into a tailwind in Q3 and Q4. So that's why you see that tick up in the guide on the gross margin. So the drivers we had are really just again the headwinds being the component costs in Q2, that turns around. And then we still have a little bit of a drag on our rate for the -- as we continue to ramp the Cat 9K portfolio for that deferral impact. But otherwise, we're executing well. Yes. I mean, we're seeing that. I mean, that's what's offsetting a lot of these headwinds on the component stuff, right? So yes, that will continue, which is, again, why you continue to see them inch up. So when the DRAM -- which has been a significant headwind for us the last bunch of quarters, we'll continue to see that benefit us. Okay. Yes, Ittai, thank you. Look, here's the thing I think it's important to understand. We have been working over the years on building best-of-breed technology for what we talk about relative to domains with our customers. So we've been building the best data center switching portfolio, the best campus switching portfolio, the best campus wireless portfolio. Over the last 3 years, what we've done is we've built an automation architecture within a domain, okay? So we built ACI in the data center. We built DNA in the campus. We've got the SD-WAN platform in the branch. We've got a security control center that actually automates a security architecture. And now what we're doing is we're beginning to bring those together. So when you hear us talk about multidomain, it means that we're giving our customers the ability to drive automation across all of those domains. So -- and you're going to see even more announcements over the next few months relative to extending that. We extended it into the IoT architecture. So think about an application that's either running in the cloud or running in the data center that requires a certain policy that gets deployed across all those domains, and I think that's the thing that our customers are really excited about. So now where are we? We're still early. I mean, it's -- I would still say we're in the early innings. I mean, this transition, if you look back at the number of years that customers were buying and sweating a lot of this infrastructure, then that sort of the base that we have ahead of us to actually move into this new architecture. So I would say it's still very early across all those areas that I just described. Yes. I think what we gave -- Kelly, you gave a broader Switching number, I think. We said overall Switching business was up double digits. So I mean, it's a pretty big business. So we are pleased with that. And on the 400 gig, right, I mean... And the 400 gig, yes, I'll tell you, we've got a lot of work going on in both our data center switching portfolio, where we're in some early field trials, as well as in our networking portfolio with some of the work that's going on there. And we believe that sometime middle of this year, we'll begin to see broad-based deployments. We're happy with that. I think there's a couple of key differentiators for us, Ittai. We build our own silicon. The Luxtera acquisition is going to bring the optics into that for us as well. Instead of us having to go out and procure the optics, we'll be able to more tightly integrate them. The whole intent-based architecture we have and the ability for us with our silicon to do real-time packet examinations for the customers and let them look at packet flows dynamically, there's a lot of differentiators, including a lot of power consumption advantages we think we're going to have. So sort of middle of this year, we'll begin to see if all that comes to fruition, but I think the teams are in a good spot. Well, I think we -- we gave that number, right, the emerging markets? Yes, order's up 6%. Yes, up 6% on orders. And BRICM was up 2%. BRICM was up 2%. So I think 6% in light of what we've heard from others around that space. And historically, what we've seen is when interest rates in the U.S. start rising, it creates challenges in emerging countries. And I think if you press Kelly, she'd probably tell you that currency was a slight headwind for us as well. So I think the teams are doing well, and it speaks to the relevance of what we've built. We've had some big build-outs in India. So India slowed a little bit for us but still quite positive. I think Russia was slightly negative. Mexico was positive. It's the same story. It's a portfolio of emerging countries. And right now, we have more that are performing well from a volume perspective. China was roughly flat for the last quarter. But overall, again, I'm pleased given the complexities that our teams are facing, both geopolitically and from a currency perspective. I think they executed really well. And I think it speaks to the teams themselves on the ground and the portfolio that our engineering organization's built. I think, Tal, the -- I guess this is a quarter where it helps not to have as much exposure. But I think we're still very happy with our progress we're making there. Some of these big transitions that we're talking about, the 100 gig, the 400 gig, those are going to be opportunities for us to try to insert. And we're working hard to actually position ourselves well for that. But I don't think that I could give any more color than what you've already heard from those who have a pretty significant exposure in that space. We're still plugging along and doing all the same things that we've told you we're doing. I would say that we still haven't gotten to a substantial different position than what we described to you probably 12 or 18 months ago, but we continue to make progress. And we've said it's going to be a long journey to get there. Yes. It's a good question. So first of all, the magnitude of the market opportunity in China skews the overall global market share numbers. So when -- if you're not participating in a material way in China, then it's very difficult to gain share if you're just looking at it broadly across the world. So we've begun to look at it without China and with China just to see how we're doing. What I would tell you is that, look, I think our innovation -- I said this in my prepared comments at the beginning. I think our portfolio right now from an innovation perspective, and particularly with the work the teams are doing in the SP space and the work that we're doing around the 5G packet core and some of these next-generation platforms that are going to hit the market this year, I would put our innovation up against theirs and anybody else's in the world right now. I think if you look at our performance in EMEA and in APJC over the last few quarters, I would suggest that we're not only holding our own, but we're competing and winning. And I would tell you, last quarter, we saw positive growth in SP in both of those regions. And so I feel very confident that not only can we compete, but that we are and we're winning right now. And so the share comment from them could be related to the size of the Chinese market, and they're confident that the math works. But in other parts of the world, I'll tell you, we're doing really well right now. I'm on for John. You talked about double-digit growth in campus. Are the new Catalyst 9K products that you introduced about a quarter ago starting to contribute to revenue? I'm really just trying to get at how much more there is to go in campus and whether it's unreasonable to think campus could be up double digits for the full year as the newer Cat 9K products start to layer on. Well, I think when you just look at the raw 9K sales versus the installed base of the products that the 9K replaces, we are very early in that cycle. And we just launched the 9200. When did that start? A quarter ago. A quarter ago. We just started shipping this quarter. Just started shipping this quarter. So the products that we announced in the middle of 2017 clearly are flowing through revenue. The 9200 just started contributing to that. But again, if you look at where we are versus the installed base that these products replace, it's very early. And then a quick follow-up on M&A. I wonder if you could comment on capital allocation. Now that the core business is growing very healthy, is it time for accelerated M&A, perhaps? Well, I'll make a comment, and Kelly can add on to it. I don't think that the growth of the core fundamentally changes or -- our overarching acquisition strategy. I think that we've had an acquisition strategy that's continued to add to our portfolio and expanding our portfolio. What I alluded to early on is that our strategy of not only creating adjacent expansions to our portfolio but really driving innovation back into our core so that we can get growth from both given the size of our core markets, that's working. So I don't think that our overall M&A strategy changes because of the success of the core. But Kelly, you... Yes, no. It never has changed, right? I mean, I think our strategy has always been clear. We're going to invest in the business first. And we're always looking for M&A no matter what the environment is, and we're going to do smart M&A. And then we're committed to our dividend growth like we have been. And then, of course, the share buyback. And again, I think you saw the latter 2 there. We just announced again another increase to the dividend, just showing the commitment we have and the faith we have in the cash flows of the business, as well as just another increase in the share buyback authorization. So I'd say it's independent to how the core business is doing. It's just a critical part of our overall strategy. Pierre, thanks for the question. What I've said several times in a lot of interviews is that I've been amazed at the resilience that we've seen around the world in light of all of the macro environment and the geopolitical dynamics, whether it's a shutdown or it's U.S.-China trade or it's Brexit or it's stress in Italy or it's political unrest in certain emerging countries. I mean, it's amazing the resilience that we've seen. What I would tell you is that our enterprise customers, given the focus, they really -- they don't view this technology anymore as an optional enabler of a strategy that they've come up with. They now view the technology as a core part of their strategy. So I mean, many of the strategies they're driving around revenue growth don't work if they don't continue to invest in technology. Many of the things they're trying to do around simplification and cost reduction and productivity in their IT infrastructure as well as being able to efficiently deal with this new multi-cloud world, which is super complicated, I mean, they can't just stop. I mean, they have to keep executing. And I'd say that most of them have a paranoia that if they do stop investing, their competitors will not and they'll fall behind. So all that being said, I will just tell you, our customers -- I haven't seen any general difference over the last 90 days in the discussions we've had, with the exception of talking to a customer who has very high exposure to the Chinese market. But even then, they talk about the impact of the geopolitical situation, but they never connect it to any sort of spending shift that -- some of them may do that, but I'm not having those conversations. Everybody seems to be moving the same place they were 3, 6 months ago. Are you talking just Cisco ONE, what we have provided before? Yes. I'd say, For Cisco ONE, we are now basically over 31,000, 31,500, in that range. And I'd say the thing to think about as you think about that going forward, as we move more and more of the portfolios to this DNA architecture and the architecture we're rolling out more and more, you're going to see more and more of our customers going to that kind of framework where the software is included in that as well. So we continue to grow the Cisco ONE bundles. But again, as we progress through the early innings of the Enterprise Networking, Cat 9K and so on portfolio transitioning, you're going to see more and more going to the DNA architecture and software bundles of that. No, we don't disclose that. Yes. Yes, I would say, to the first part of that question, we are continuing to progress along those lines. And with the new rev rec, because it's accelerating some of these things that -- when you pull a snapshot for this year, it's accelerating some of it. But overall, for the longer-term strategy, it's absolutely progressing like we said it would at FAC. And yes, this quarter, we were around 2% for the acceleration when you compare the 606 versus 605 accounting change difference. Chuck, I wanted to ask you, it's interesting to me that the focus on hybrid and hybrid cloud is starting to evolve, especially given where people thought we might end up just a couple of years ago. Can you talk about how well-formed do you think your customers are? And I guess, are they seeing or can they understand the real value that Cisco can deliver in hybrid implementations yet, and how much missionary work [you] still have to do? Yes. Thanks, James. Look, here's the situation our customers find themselves in: if you contrast where they thought they were going to be 4 or 5 years ago, they thought that they were going to move to the cloud. And we've joked about it being a euphoric neighborhood where they just move and everything is simple. And somewhere along the way, they find themselves with 4 or 5 cloud providers, multiple collaboration cloud providers, 100 SaaS providers, an explosion of IoT at the Edge. And so what's happening is -- and by the way, they still have private data centers with applications that can't be migrated to the cloud. They've now gotten to a place where certain applications they're repatriating from the cloud. And the reality is that they now find themselves with a more complicated environment than they had 5 years ago when they began this journey to simplification. That's the irony. If you think about what I just described, there's only one piece of technology that is consistent across all of those things that I just talked about, and that is the network. And so what's happening is a lot of the things that have to occur to help them navigate this need to happen in the network. And so that's where this whole policy automation strategy that we have is really important, because for them to be able to deal with applications running anywhere, deal with users operating anywhere, the data flows and the traffic flows are nothing that look like what led them to architect their networks the way they did a decade ago. And then couple that with security and the fact that in security, you're not protecting a perimeter anymore. So it's not about a big, fat honking firewall. It's about an architecture that really does have integrated security from the network to the cloud, to the Edge, to email, where you're building a comprehensive integrated strategy, where you're seeing threats in one area and you're protecting across all those domains. So to answer your question, I think that 2 years ago, we had to convince customers that this is what we felt. And today, I'd say most enterprise customers, they could present a whole set of slides to you before we even start talking about the challenges they face and the importance of the network going forward. So thanks for the last question. Thank you. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I'll make a few closing comments. First of all, I think our teams have executed incredibly well in light of a very complicated macro and geopolitical environment that we find ourselves in. Our engineering teams over the last few years have delivered on innovation to a point where I will tell you that our portfolio is in the best shape it's been in years. And I think we are in a very good position with our customers based on the strategies that they're deploying going forward. And I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to execute. When you look to the future, there's 2 things -- there's 2 elements that we have to consider. There's the geopolitical, macro issues, and we'll continue to navigate them to the best of our ability. And then there's our own execution, which I think is probably near the peak of what our teams have done in quite a while. So we feel good about where we are. There's obviously a lot of variables, a lot of complexities, but we're pleased with what we accomplished last quarter. We feel good about next quarter, and we're going to continue to execute. Thanks for joining us. Thanks, Chuck. And I'm just going to wrap up here. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2019 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 15, 2019, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact Cisco's Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining today's call.","My question, Chuck and Kelly, would like to get your thoughts into the secular growth portfolio you have around AppDynamics, Meraki, Viptela, Duo, et cetera. Are these assets starting to drive new sales opportunities, perhaps new product refresh for the core business? Or are these mostly like stand-alone, like they're growing in their respective areas? I guess I wanted to start off with the public sector side of things. The order trajectory there improved a lot to 18%, and yet we're all sitting here expecting U.S. Fed to be weak. So I wonder if you could sort of comment on the U.S. Fed impact on the current quarter and then why we're seeing such a big order acceleration there. And then I have a follow-up. Okay, great, Chuck. Appreciate that. And then I wanted to -- on the follow-up, just on the enterprise order rate. I mean, that was, I think, 15% last quarter. It's decelerated a little bit to 11%. Just comment on what you're seeing there. I mean, you've talked before about last year being such a strong year. And I'm just curious if you think that's just kind of a one-quarter thing or is that a trajectory we would expect to continue? I've got 2 related questions. One, my customary, what's your rate of price erosion? And Kelly, in connection with that, if you could talk about gross margin drivers looking forward. And related to that, if I do the math right, you all did $4.5 billion of operating cash flow if you exclude the $800 million in connection with that onetime tax item. That's a record by over $400 million or 10% of what historically is not your strongest cash flow quarter. The question is, is that a new normal? Or were there other extraordinary items in that number? Kelly, I trust the ongoing shift to software has a -- will have a benefit over time? Maybe -- I have a 2-part question. I guess, Chuck, trying to kind of dig in to what Rod was asking before. You're running multiple product cycles in multiple product areas. But if you had to kind of put it all together across your entire customer base, in what phase of the adoption are we, embrace for the customers of this new portfolio? Are we early cycle, mid-cycle? Help me think about that. That's great. And then just as a follow-up. I didn't catch the data center switch comment. Was there one or that's -- can you give us some color on where you stand there? And how do you envision 400 making its impact there, time line-wise? Chuck, I just wanted to check with you how -- what you're seeing in terms of momentum in the emerging countries. I believe, last quarter, you had very solid momentum in countries like India. Are you seeing the stronger dollar catch up to them in terms of how -- what their appetite is in terms of IT spend? If you can just help us with that. I have 2 questions -- or 1 question, 1 follow-up. The first one is just about cloud spending. We hear a lot about weakness in spending. On one hand, you're not very, very exposed. You're exposed in certain areas; and other areas, not. On the other hand, it's a big growth opportunity for you. Can you discuss your participation in cloud and your comments on any weakness in cloud spending? And then I have a follow-up on the Chinese vendors. So maybe -- again, I have a follow-up just on that. But maybe you can discuss your exposure to cloud and the difference between hyperscale -- hyperscalers versus smaller cloud vendors and if you see similar trends with smaller companies, where you do have exposure, versus larger companies. But I wanted to ask you, this morning, I hosted a call with Huawei. And one of the things they were saying is they think they're actually going to gain market share despite all the issues. And I want to -- I know you don't have -- you don't compete with them in China on certain things but -- and you don't compete with them in the U.S. But you do compete with Huawei and ZTE globally. And the question is being asked repeatedly about share gains versus Huawei and ZTE. What is your position? What is your view? What kind of experiences you've had in the last few weeks and few months on the competition with Huawei when you talk with or when you discuss this with the carriers? And how do you see your portfolio versus Huawei's portfolio in light of these issues? I'd like to come back to the comments you made, Chuck, on emerging market, on China. So what I heard is, clearly, that you're very happy with your performance there, relative. And it's true that having like a flat sales in China (inaudible) is great. And overall, your emerging market is holding well, especially when you take into account currency. But really, the question I would like to ask you is about how conversations with clients are going there? What's your outlook? Like you guys at Cisco used to be a bellwether. You have very, very good insight into how enterprises are feeling about the macro developments. So from all the conversations you've had with clients this -- in the last 3 months, what's your take? What's your 2019 macro perspective? I just wanted to get a quick one regarding the number of ELAs you signed in the quarter and what percentage of revenues that actually reflected. Yes, exactly. That's right. And then are you comfortable giving a percentage of revenue, something like that, that we could get a little bit of an indicator from? To follow on, at the last Analyst Day, Kelly, you talked about software as a percentage of total revenue, I think, going from 22% to 30% over 3 years. Can you indicate where you are in that range, if 30% is still the goal, if there's now a higher goal? And then how is 606 affecting that? And specifically, in this quarter, did 606 give you a revenue boost?

CSCO,Q3 2019,2131,4723,1589,"Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. The guidance we provided during our Q2 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another strong quarter of performance across the business, demonstrating our ability to execute despite the ongoing uncertainty in both the macro and geopolitical environments. Technology continues to be at the heart of our customer strategy, and now, more than ever, our market-leading portfolio and differentiated innovation is resonating with them as they transform their IT infrastructure. In the quarter, we delivered strong revenue, margins, non-GAAP earnings growth and operating cash flow. As we continue to help our customers achieve their business objectives, I am confident about the future of Cisco and the growth opportunities ahead of us. New technologies like cloud, AI, IoT, 5G and WiFi 6, among others, are coming together to revolutionize the way we operate our businesses and deliver new experiences for our customers and teams. We are fundamentally changing the way our customers approach their technology infrastructure to address the rising complexity in their IT environments. We are building the only integrated, multi-domain, intent-based architecture with security at the foundation. This is designed to allow our customers to securely connect their users and devices over any network to any application no matter where they are. We are integrating capabilities like artificial intelligence and machine learning across the entire portfolio so customers have greater insights, resulting in better and faster business outcomes. Now for some highlights across our business, starting with Infrastructure Platforms. Over the past several years, we've been working to integrate intent-based networking across our enterprise access portfolio to help our customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks. We brought to market tremendous innovation across wired, wireless and enterprise routing, including SD-WAN, resulting in a continued, strong traction of our Enterprise Networking portfolio. We are moving into an era of truly immersive and pervasive wireless connectivity, which generates demand for high-density, low-latency performance for real-time experiences over both wired and wireless networks. Enterprise networks today must be optimized for agility and security, leveraging cloud and wireless capabilities with the ability to garner insights from the data and security integrated throughout. Cisco is in a unique position to deliver this for our customers. We recently announced several new platforms expanding our Enterprise Networking portfolio with the launch of our subscription-based WiFi 6 access points and Catalyst 9600 Campus core switches, purpose-built for cloud scale networking. By combining our automation and analytics software with our broad portfolio of switches, access points and controllers, we are creating a seamless, end-to-end, wireless-first architecture for our customers. We also expanded our open roaming partnership ecosystem to now include Apple, Intel, Samsung and others to make Wi-Fi onboarding simple. With our newest Catalyst 9000 family additions, we have completed the most comprehensive Enterprise Networking portfolio refresh in our history. We have rebuilt our entire access portfolio with intent-based networking across wired and wireless. We also now have one unified operating system and policy management platform to drive simplicity and consistency across our customers' networks, all enabled by a software subscription model. In the Data Center, our strategy is to deliver multi-cloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency no matter where applications or data resides by extending ACI and our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex, to the cloud. Our partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are great examples of how we continue to work with web-scale providers to deliver new innovation. For example, we recently introduced Cisco Cloud ACI for AWS, a service that allows customers to manage and secure applications running in a private data center or in Amazon Web Services cloud environments. We also expanded our partnership with Google. We announced support for their multi-cloud platform, Anthos, to help customers build secure applications everywhere from private data centers to public clouds with greater ease. Going forward, we will integrate this platform with our broad Data Center portfolio, including HyperFlex, ACI, SD-WAN and Stealthwatch Cloud to deliver the best multi-cloud experience for our Enterprise customers. Moving to Security. We continue to see strong momentum with another quarter of double-digit growth driven by our world-class Security portfolio. Cisco is the world's largest cybersecurity company for enterprises with thousands of cybersecurity experts helping our customers globally. Our portfolio covers the entire threat continuum of the modern enterprise and integrates security into every networking domain. We are enabling all of our customers to transform and secure their networks for the rapidly evolving multi-cloud world. We have a platform that continuously detects threats and verifies trust. By combining Duo, Umbrella, Stealthwatch, ISE and Tetration, we offer an end-to-end, zero-trust architecture that is strongly resonating with customers. Now turning to applications. We continue to execute very well on our collaboration business. These platforms are becoming increasingly critical to how enterprises operate and manage their workforce. Customers are always looking to enhance their meeting experiences, and cognitive collaboration is quickly becoming the de facto standard for delivering more personalized experiences and transforming how we work. At Enterprise Connect, we introduced several new cognitive collaboration capabilities within our WebEx portfolio integrating AI and ML to bring context and intelligence to meetings. The new innovations we launched include people insights, facial recognition and WebEx Calling, all which help to increase our customers' productivity making work simple and seamless. Going forward, you'll see this greater level of intelligence integrated into every piece of our collaboration portfolio across calling, messaging, meetings, devices and contact center. We also had another quarter of strong growth in AppDynamics as thousands of customers rapidly adopt our Application Intelligence platform for smarter and faster decision-making. The ability to manage end-to-end application performance across all cloud environments is increasingly important. AppDynamics is the market leader in application and infrastructure analytics delivering unparalleled innovation. We offer the most comprehensive, end-to-end visibility from connected devices and applications to the underlying network providing better application performance and user experience. To summarize, I'm very proud of the progress our teams have made against our strategic priorities to drive profitable growth, accelerate differentiated innovation for our customers and successfully execute on our own transformation to more software and subscriptions. Enterprise IT architectures must transform to help our customers get the most out of all of their IT investments. More than ever, our customers need a trusted partner with an end-to-end architecture strategy to simplify, transform and secure their businesses, and Cisco is that partner. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you. Great. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the guidance for Q4. Q3 was a strong quarter across the business. We executed well with solid orders momentum, strong revenue growth, margins, EPS and operating cash flow. Product orders grew 4%. Total revenue was $13.0 billion, up 6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.2%, up 0.2 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, up 8%. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.78, up 18%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7% to $9.7 billion. Infrastructure Platforms grew 5% with solid growth across all businesses. Switching had another good quarter with growth driven by the continued ramp of the Cat 9K and strength in our ACI portfolio. Routing grew, driven by SD-WAN. We saw solid growth in Wireless driven by growth across the entire portfolio. And Data Center was up with growth in both HyperFlex and servers. Applications was up 9% with growth across all the businesses. We saw solid growth in Unified Communications software, TelePresence and AppDynamics. Security was up 21% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat. We're very pleased also with integration of Duo into the Security portfolio. Service revenue was up 3% driven by software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 65% of total software revenue, up 9 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q3 results year-over-year, there was a 40 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw solid momentum in Q3 with total product orders growing 4%. Looking at our geographies. Americas was flat, EMEA was up 9% and APJC was up 6%. Total emerging markets was up 5% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 2%. In our customer segments, Enterprise was up 9%, Commercial grew 5%, Public Sector was up 10% and Service Provider was down 13%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 64.6%. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q3 net income was $3.0 billion, and EPS was $0.69. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalent and investments of $34.6 billion. Q3 operating cash flow was $4.3 billion, up 79%. Normalized for the $1.3 billion of foreign taxes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we paid in Q3 of fiscal '18, operating cash flow was up 16%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $7.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $6 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion of our quarterly dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. In terms of M&A, we closed on the Luxtera acquisition. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. To summarize, we had a strong Q3. We executed well with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. This guidance includes a type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Note that we have normalized our fourth quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q4 of fiscal '18, which we divested on October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call. We expect revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31% to 32%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the lines for questions and start to begin the queuing process.","Sure. Thanks, Rod. So on the tariffs, if you remember back many months ago when the 10% tariffs were announced, we said we had basically 3 phases to our strategy. The first was we would continue to dialogue with the administration to make sure they understand the impact. The second is we'll continue to do what we've always done, which is optimize our supply chain, which we've been doing for the last 20 years. And then the third is we will make pricing adjustments where necessary if needed. I'll tell you that the team has been working incredibly hard over the last 6 months. And so last week, when we saw the indication that the tariffs were going to move to 25% on Friday morning, the teams kicked in, and we actually have executed completely on everything that we need to do to deal with the tariffs. We are -- operationally, all that we needed to do is now behind us. And we see very minimal impact at this point based on all the great work the teams have done, and it is absolutely baked into our guide going forward. That's the first question. The second question on the Service Provider business, look, we've always talked about this business as being highly lumpy and very big customer-driven. And we've seen quarters where you see several big customers stall, and this is a result. And most of the impact of what we saw was in the Americas. And if you just look at the CapEx spend year-over-year, I think it's in the U.S., Kelly, the data that we had was -- the CapEx spend overall was down almost 20%. So this is something that we have always said from one quarter to the next, until we get into a real network buildout relative to 5G, that we knew these quarters are going to be lumpy. So it was very isolated to the Americas, and I think that the strength in our Public Sector and our Commercial and Enterprise business continues to indicate that the innovation that our teams have brought into the portfolio is still resonating with our customers. Thanks, Ittai. So a couple of comments. Number one, the WebEx business continues to grow very solidly. We're very happy with what's been going on. The team has done a phenomenal job of really modernizing that platform over the last year under Amy's leadership. And the other thing to remember is that this is the first quarter where BroadSoft is normalized in the run rate, so we've had the benefit of that. So some of the growth rates that you've seen were obviously boosted by that over the last few quarters. So that's on the numbers front. I tell you what, the cognitive collab stuff that was announced at Enterprise Connect, I think, is going to be game-changing. What we see with some of our competitors is that they're focused on taking 4 collaboration endpoints into a customer and showing a great simple experience. And frankly, if we take 4 endpoints in with WebEx, the new WebEx, we can show a great, more rich, simple experience as well. So one of the things that we're focused on right now is transitioning all of our customers to our modern platforms. Because we've been in this business for years, and so our customers have varying combinations of technology. So one of the big things that we need to do is get everybody to the most modern platforms, which we think are very competitive. And when you put the cognitive capabilities on top of it that -- if you haven't seen it, we should get you a demo of it, it's pretty powerful. So we're very confident where we are in the space. Vijay, can you speak up a bit? We're having a hard time hearing you. Yes. That's better. Thank you. Yes. Thanks for your comments, Vijay. On the -- look, I think we have to step back and look at what the teams has accomplished on the Enterprise Networking portfolio. We launched the first Catalyst 9000 in the summer of 2017. And 2 weeks ago, we completed the portfolio across -- our enterprise routing platforms are going through a refresh, our -- the Catalyst 9000 Switching family as well as all of the access points. And if you go back 2 years ago, we didn't have a single networking product with a software subscription on it. And today, every product in the enterprise routing space, the enterprise Wi-Fi space and the enterprise Campus switching space is sold with a mandatory subscription. So the progress that the teams have made is phenomenal. They've also -- we had multiple operating systems running across those different platforms. We've now consolidated it to a single operating system, and it all is running under a single automation platform so that our customers can deploy policy. So it's been an incredible amount of work that the teams have done. Now when I look at -- as we've talked about with the customers, we're still very early in the transition. If you look at -- you could assume customers used to keep Campus switching products for, I don't know, 7 years, 5 to 7 years. And we've been at small portions of this portfolio for the last 2 years but just very small portions, and so we still believe we're in the very early days of the transition. And what you see -- Wi-Fi 6 is effectively what used to be called 802.11ax. And what's happening now is when you get these high-performance access points into the organizations and you get the low-latency, immersive experience possibilities, then it's also going to drive the need to upgrade the backbones. Our guys like to say, ""Behind every great wireless network is a great wired network,"" and so we think it's the beginning of an overarching refresh for our customers as they modernize their infrastructure based on this cloud transition that they're all going through. So that's how we look at it today. I'll give you some color, and then, Kelly, I'll let you comment on the breakdown of the numbers. I think this is being driven -- if you think about what's happening with our customers today, they build their security architecture based on the underlying assumption that they had users at the edge of the network and they had applications in a private data center, and so the way you architected that was you protected your parameter. And now our customers are operating in an environment where they have mobile users everywhere. They have branches out there. They have this explosion of IoT connectivity that's occurring, and they have applications that are running in hundreds of different places between SaaS applications, their private data center, public clouds. And so the whole notion of a security architecture has changed completely, and our teams have been building towards that over the last couple of years. So what happens is we have to protect the customers' data and their traffic, wherever it is, and that's why we've been investing in all these new capabilities, making these acquisitions. And I think that architecture where you can actually see threats across the continuum and then dynamically defend across that same -- those same threat -- that same threat surface area is what's really driving the growth here. And it's also a part of our business that is very, very, very software-rich and is highly concentrated in subscriptions. And so we also have that recurring piece of this business, which is what we're trying to drive in the rest of our portfolio. Kelly? Yes. I think the only thing I'll add to that is -- I mean it's the revenue growth -- obviously, the Duo acquisition I talked about in the earlier comments was part of it. But I can tell you it was very broad-based across the entire Security portfolio, including network security, advanced threat, cloud security, the big drivers. So very broad-based. And just to add to Chuck's comments, don't forget that because we are embedding Security into this Enterprise Networking portfolio, we also benefit from the great growth that we're seeing in the Enterprise portfolio. Yes. No, we haven't given out the software revenue actual number, but I think the last time we gave it out was at our Financial Analyst Conference. And again, we're growing very quickly, the software portfolio, in line, if not faster, than what we had talked about then. So well on track or ahead of where we told everyone we would be at the Financial Analyst Conference in 2017. So maybe I'll start with the first few, and then, Chuck, you can hit on the wireless. So Paul, on price, we continue to be very disciplined on price. And what you'll see in the Q is from a product gross margin rate impact, it was 1.1 points year-over-year. So right in line, if not slightly better than what it has been in the last few quarters. And to your question on DRAM, yes, as we expected, DRAM turned this quarter and became a tailwind for us in Q3. So that is part of why I guided Q3 gross margin where I did and where we actually ended up on our gross margin at the 64.6%. We're benefiting from that. And if I'll just comment a little bit on the tariff question, as Chuck said, it is baked in our guidance. And from what we have baked in, there will be -- we still have some manufacturing happening in China, but we've greatly, greatly reduced our exposure working with our supply chain and our suppliers. So the impact that we're expecting that -- again, we're trying to mitigate. We have incorporated in the guide that we gave for Q4, and we think we can manage through that. Of course, we'll be watching that as the quarter goes on. Yes. And Paul, then on the Wi-Fi, I don't think -- we've not -- I don't think we've seen any substantive change on the Wi-Fi front. I saw some of the same comments earlier in the week, I think. But in general, I think our customers  -- I think that most of our customers are just continuing to build out, and I think they'll transition now to the new WiFi 6-enabled ones and keep moving. We launched in the last week of our quarter, so it was too early for the -- to take any... Yes, we wouldn't have any, given when we launched. And the tariffs, I'll tell you, our teams have just done an amazing job. I mean that's the bottom line. And so everybody worked so hard to a point where literally, last week, the teams executed on everything incremental we needed to do to deal with it. And it's relatively immaterial at this point, and it's baked in the guide. Some companies have talked about pauses in demand, whether it be digestion of inventory such as overbuilding, a uncertainty economic environment. It appears, if I'm reading your outlook and your results pretty correctly, you haven't seen that. Can you maybe help us bridge the gap of was it -- did you just have a lot better pulse on the inventory in the channel or end markets a little different? Because if I remember right, I think your cloud sales are north of 20% but maybe below 30% or something, but we've heard a lot about a pause in cloud spending. Yes. I think the only area where we saw a real shift was in Service Provider. And across the rest of the business, we watch the same TV shows you guys watch. We see the same stress around the world. We see the same risks. But if you go back and look at our quarter, if you just -- obviously, SP was SP. But in general, our linearity from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter was pretty much the same as it was in the same quarter a year ago based on where we ended up. So outside of SP, I don't think we saw any substantive change. No, it was really SP. And Jim, just to clarify because I saw your note that you published. Again, ,when you say cloud -- if you're meeting the subset web scale, I guess, that's not the correct number out there of what our -- we've never -- we haven't given it out, but I just want to make sure that that's not really kind of like what our web-scale exposure is. Great. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions, perhaps, maybe for Kelly on a couple of small things. First, deferred revenue was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, and I know that there's been some adjustments around 606. So I'm just wondering if we can get a little reflection on kind of what the mix is doing there. And then also, I know you addressed gross margins and some benefit and tailwind you got from components there. But at least as the numbers were reported, it seemed like a lot of the improvement was concentrated in the APAC region. And just wondered if we're interpreting that correctly. And if so, was there anything unique happening there, perhaps, that we didn't see in the rest of the world? On the market? Yes. Yes. Yes. So first, the deferred revenue. Yes -- no, it's a great pickup. I will say the only thing that's kind of changed in the deferred revenue is -- and we kind of talked about this maybe a couple of calls ago, is it's really driven by our collab business. They've gone much more to month-to-month billing. So therefore, it doesn't flow through deferred revenue anymore, whereas in the past, we might -- it might be financed with customers or it would go through -- they'd pay upfront. Now it's really going month-to-month, which again is just how it's recognized through the balance sheets. So that's really what's driving it. If you look at the rest of our businesses like with the ramp of the subscriptions of the Enterprise portfolio as well as Security, those are all growing quarter-on-quarter. And as you know, the big tick-down from a year ago is because of the change of the accounting standard down. But from a business operational thing, the only change is -- quarter-on-quarter is really just the shift of the collab business going more month-to-month versus paying upfront. And can I just ask just a quick follow-up there? And so when should we expect that to stop being a drag? And -- or are we going to see that happen across other parts of the business that you could see some volatility there? No. I think you're going to continue to see -- I mean. Again, the collab, I think, is just going through that just how we're changing our offers and what we're offering there. But I think the rest of the business is going to continue to start building up. So you'll see that get back to, I'd say, growing here over the next few quarters. Okay. And then the gross margin is seemingly concentrated in APAC. Any major reason for that? Yes. Actually, the gross margin in APAC was literally very focused mostly in Japan and mostly driven by our -- some big deals in Service Provider that had some lower margins than the typical average that we have in Japan. But it's very isolated to that. Yes, Mitch. So on the security front, I think it's really what I was talking about earlier. The architectures in our -- for our customers have changed. And I know -- I can remember conversations a couple of years ago about things that we're building. And the team would tell me, ""Look, we're building for where our customers are going to be next year and the year after."" And so -- because I was debating with them in some cases about where they were investing, and they were right. So they've -- we've had some very strategic acquisitions that have contributed to it and continue to grow. And I do believe that this -- the architectural approach as opposed to historically what we've seen, which is when you're defending a perimeter, you just -- you can just buy the best-of-breed all around. And just like if I'm defending e-mail, I buy this. If I'm -- I put in a firewall here and it can be -- they don't have to necessarily communicate. And today, the architecture really requires a platform where you ingest threat information from lots of different sources, and then you dynamically defend across all those same vectors, and I think that's what the teams have built. So as far as growth rates, we'll have to see. I'm sure they'll move around based on acquisitions and other things that we do. But I think that we're quite happy with where the teams are. I think it's a good, solid business for us for a very long time. As far as the IT spending, look, I don't have anything to add to what we -- what you've heard. I think that in today's world, we've -- I've said repeatedly that I've been pretty amazed at the resiliency of the global economy over the last couple of years. There are certainly -- as I said early in our prepared comments, there's a lot of dynamics at play around the world. There's a lot of geopolitical issues. We've heard some macro issues in certain cases. And we're just going to continue to execute on the things that we can do. And -- but what's going to happen 6 months from now, I don't have any greater visibility, I don't think, than anybody else. So... Yes, it's a very valid question. And we have a lot of things going on with the web scale providers today. I think 400 gig certainly will represent an opportunity for us to insert. I think that the architectural transition points is really where you have an opportunity. We've known that for decades from working with the telcos and service providers. You typically don't insert into an existing architecture. It really requires a transition. So I think thinking about those kinds of things and 400 gig would be representative of that. But to give you any time line, I think we're just going to have to wait and keep plugging away. We're still making progress. We've made a ton of progress on the relationship side. We've got a lot of deep, technical discussions that are going on. They're spending a lot of time on our Campus with us. So we continue to make progress, but these are big, long-term decisions that they're making, and we're going to keep plugging away. Yes. I mean, again, I think if you go back and look over the last couple of years of where -- just when even look at our guides over the last 3 years, and we've steadily moved up our gross margins. And I think if you go back 3 years, we were guiding 61% to 62%. We've steadily come up. And when I guided Q3, I moved up another 0.5 point to get to the 63%, 64%. So again, you're seeing that go through our gross margins as they're going up there. I think there's always puts and takes. We have the natural price erosion that we see every quarter, but we're driving productivity. DRAM turnaround is helping us a lot, and that's going to help us with positivity there. It's going to help us if we do have, again, incremental costs we can offset whether it's tariffs or anything else. So the 64% to 65% here we're guiding now, I think, is pretty good. And our whole goal and the whole reason we're making this shift to software besides to continue innovation is it's a great way to drive margin accretion. So you're just going to continue to see us shift our portfolio that way. Okay. Jim, so let me -- on the 5G front, I think there's a couple of things I would call out. Number one, the CapEx data that we saw last quarter -- and even the forecasts don't look incredibly healthy for these guys. But where they are spending money primarily today as it relates to 5G is they're building out the macro radio portion of their networks first, and they're leveraging their existing core networks to run the early trials that they have on 5G basically. And we believe that sometime in the future, when they have -- when the number of connections increases and the capacity gets to a point, then they're obviously going to begin to build out these new backbones dedicated to the 5G infrastructure, which is where we will generally come into play. We're also obviously selling them packet core technology for the new 5G networks today, but the big play for us is when they begin to evolve their networks to accommodate the traffic. And we've always said we felt like that would be sometime in calendar 2020. We're working with lots of them on architectural designs and where they're going, but it's really going to be core routing backbone technology, where we're going to see -- we should see the big impact from 5G. And we'll obviously have to wait and see how it plays out. Yes. And just on the VNS, I would just say I don't -- SP customers are a little different than Enterprise customers, right? Everybody's looking for automation and software-defined, everything, and I think our entire portfolio is moving that direction. And it's just the nature of the beast, whether it's SP or enterprise, right? Prices for core are getting less and less the more that we're driving just more throughput and everything else. So it's nothing VNS-specific, but it's the entire portfolio. The software value -- the values where the software is in the automation that we're bringing to our customers. Kelly? Yes, sure. So I'll take the top line first. So yes, the 4% orders growth, again, like Chuck said, if you look at the rest of the business, they were all up, the 9% for Enterprise, 10% for Public Sector, 5% for Commercial. So that's all great strength. It's service provider where we had the issue. And as you know, when we guide, we have what's sitting in backlog. We can -- we have very good visibility into the pipeline, and we have -- we work with all our regional sales leaders in terms of what they're seeing. So we feel very comfortable with the guide that we're giving you based on all of those factors. So it's basically incorporated for the SP slowdown that we saw in the orders. In terms of the revenue question, so yes, we talked about acquisitions. It's really only Duo and a very tiny bit of Luxtera as our inorganic from the acquisition. So that was only 40 basis points of our growth. And the 606 impact this quarter was only 1.2 points, so it was a relatively small number compared to the other quarter. So it was 1% -- slightly over 1%, 1.2 points from that perspective. And then on the deferred, it's -- that's more of a -- one of the puts and takes on the margin driver because we are -- like, for example, on the Enterprise Networking portfolio, deferring -- we're still deferring. Even though we're deferring last, we're still deferring. So that kind of, as we have these new replacement products that we have the subscription on, that hurts your rate a little bit, but it's nothing material. So from a revenue, the 606 and acquisitions are fairly small. And Steve, on the culture issue, we've basically, I think, been amplifying what's always been a core part of Cisco but really, really prioritizing it and trying to just create an environment in today's world where people want to work because it's an incredibly competitive environment for talent. And I guess the way that we look in metrics -- we've been focused on communication with our employees, clear, authentic frequent communication. We've been focused on giving back. And what we've discovered is that we have a lot of employees who care deeply about giving back to their communities, and so I told them that our ability to give back and our ability to do the things that they love to do is highly contingent upon us running a great business. And so the 2 are very interconnected. As far as how do we rate it. I mean if you look at every external employer ranking, we've moved up. The one -- I tell you, around the world, great places to work, I think we're #1 in countries around the world, maybe 15 to 20 countries around the world. And in the U.S., which is one that just came out recently, we -- I think when I became CEO, we're #87 in the U.S. And 2 months ago, we were rated #6. And over 70% of the input for that -- those rankings come directly from the employees. And we obviously watch Glassdoor, where we're above 4.0 and all those kinds of things. So we're working hard on it. We think it's important because of -- it's important because when your employees are happy, they actually do a much better job and help the overall results. So it's somewhat cyclical. Yes. Thanks, Pierre. It's really hard to quantify because the technology that we're building that is either integrated in with the cloud providers or offered off the cloud platforms or enabling our customers to transition to the cloud or expand to the cloud, as you put, which is the same word we like to use. So we appreciate you coming up with that. We stole it. It's everything from extending ACI from the private data center into the cloud to offering virtualized routing functions off of AWS and Azure for developers, virtualized security services even to the SD-WAN technology and now integrating it with our cloud security gateways and then the integration of some of these hybrid stacks like Azure Stack or what we talked about from Google that they announced recently, integrating that with our technology on-premise, the Kubernetes stack that we've done. So there's an awful lot of areas where we play. We talk about the fact that while customers are moving some applications to the cloud, they didn't move their employees to the cloud. And so there's a big opportunity, which is what we've been focused on, which is to evolve this access portfolio to really enable this transition to the cloud that our customers have been undertaking. So it really is touching massive amounts of our portfolio, and I think you'll only see us continue to drive more technology that facilitates our customers' move in this area. So appreciate the question. So I'll wrap up. I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today. Obviously, we're proud of what our teams continue to accomplish. We're operating in an environment that has very complex macro and geopolitical dynamics right now. But we're continuing to execute as well as we can on the things that we control, and that's what we plan to do going forward. So thanks for spending time with us today, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thanks, Chuck. This is Marilyn. Just want to close up the call here. So Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and annual results, will be on Wednesday, August 14, 2019 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we're very much looking forward to speaking with you through the remainder of the week. Thank you for joining today.","I guess I'm going to ask an obvious one, and then from the order volumes, another obvious one. I wonder if you could comment on the trade situation and the 25% rate increase and just kind of give us some idea for how much is contemplated in guidance of that. And anything else you can tell us about exposure of the business? I know that you guys had said that you thought if it went to 25%, there would be price elasticity effects. So that's the first question. The second one is obviously the Service Provider orders down 13%. That is quite a lot worse number than we would have expected. So I wonder if you could just give us any more color on what's happening there. Congrats on a great quarter and execution. Chuck, maybe you could talk about applications, a big deceleration from the level we've seen over the last 4 quarters. Clearly, AppDynamics is doing well in there. But now zoom out now in the marketplace, making a lot of noise. Help us think about WebEx, how that business is doing, how do you feel competitively positioned in the marketplace and how do you think about addressing potential competitive headwinds over there. Chuck, Kelly, Marilyn... Yes. Can you guys hear me? Yes, yes. First, I mean honestly, I would like to commend you for your recent social contributions. We do monitor that news flow in addition to what's going on in the business with many programs -- mitigation programs. Honestly, I'd like to commend you on that. And then on the earnings call question, your General Manager seemed quite excited on this WiFi 6, the Campus core switch. So my question to you and helpful for all of us is, how impactful is this new Wi-Fi 6 refresh and the new Campus core, the Catalyst 6000 refresh heading into the back half and is that a pull forward across the portfolio? Or would this just be kind of a point product swap? I'd like to focus in on Security and more specifically in the strength in the quarter that you saw. Is that being mainly driven by the new acquisitions you guys have made? Or is that more from legacy? Given that you are refreshing the Campus, are you pulling forward some of the more legacy security offerings that you had? Or is this predominantly just strength in the M&A, all the acquisitions you've made being integrated and finally going to market? Got it. And then just a small follow-up after this. It's just, are you disclosing recurring revenue percentage of total revenue this quarter just because some of the comments around subscription? Just wondering if you're giving that out. Two quick clarifications and a question. Kelly, I know we'll see it shortly, but can you talk about the rate of price erosion and what you're seeing specifically with respect to DRAM? And then, Chuck, on your comment earlier about the 25% tariff, I apologize if I misunderstood, but I just want to make sure. Are you telling us that you shifted all of your supply chain out of China so there's no exposure going forward? Or is it just a matter that you've incorporated into your guidance? And then for the question, some of your smaller peers have commented about a pause in wireless LAN and related switching deployments. As customers are waiting for Wi-Fi 6, you've now rolled out your Wi-Fi 6 access points, you upgraded the new 9600, et cetera, are you seeing that pent-up demand?. I really have 2. One in kind of the securities side, and secondly, maybe some back half update. On the Security side, you guys are growing at 20% plus. I think that back a couple of years ago, people would never believe that and would have viewed Cisco as kind of a shared donor. So I guess what has changed in terms of the products that you guys are selling? And then secondly, do you think that's something that's more sustainable, or let's call it, teens growth instead of the historical 10% growth? And then secondly, I know Cisco used to kind of give kind of a IT spend number. Can you maybe provide us any sort of commentary in terms of what you guys think of the back half? I mean is the demand environment in your guys' view going to be better, worse or kind of the same? Because I think it's a little bit difficult to figure out what you guys are going to grow at considering the first half has already been solid. So I just wanted to know if you guys can give any color there as well. Yes. Just following up on the prior question about web scale. Your progress on web scale has been a little bit TBD for a number of years. I'm wondering what you can tell us about when you think your efforts in that regard might pay off if you think the 400-gig migration is an entry point for you. Or what do we have to look forward to in that particular vertical? Okay. Well, I'll keep asking then, I guess. And then, Kelly, from your side, what can you tell us -- I guess -- I mean the mix of software does continue to increase. What can you tell us about where you would like the gross margins to be over an intermediate time frame or whatever time frame you choose, I guess? Chuck and Kelly, congrats on a fantastic quarter and execution here. Maybe just going back to Rod's initial question specifically around 5G. Maybe what products do you expect to benefit with or are you seeing orders for already? I know it's early days. And then Kelly, maybe you could discuss, is there going to be any impact related to the shift of VNS on the model? Like should we expect lower revenue contribution in the cycle but higher gross margin kind of going off to what you were just saying before to? First, Kelly, any concern about bridging the 4% order growth to the 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth? And maybe while you're talking about that you could net out the year-over-year impact of 606 M&A, which I think you gave us and then deferred, which I think is still a bit of a drag and maybe how that might look next quarter. And then, Chuck, I think you wanted to kind of tweak the culture a bit when you came in. And if you could update us in terms of things like your Net Promoter Score, externally, your return on employee surveys, how you sort of assess the culture and if that's part of the results that we're seeing. Chuck, when -- I heard you talk about how Cisco technology gets more and more integrated with the platform of the leading cloud vendor. As you can imagine, I love hearing that having different -- quite a long time that the Enterprise IT will expand into the cloud that this is going to migrate to the cloud. So I was curious to hear from you a bit more on that in terms of how big it is today in your business. I don't know if you have an idea of the take rate of Cisco technology that are moved to -- that are integrated with the cloud vendors. And if so, how do you go to market with the technology? Do you go to market in partnership with cloud vendors? Is that something you sell directly to your clients? And of course, any idea of the business model, how big it is in your revenues already today?

CSCO,Q1 2020,2239,3326,1064,"Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In Q2 of fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 fiscal 2020. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. The guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call had been normalized in the same way. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Thanks, Marilyn. We delivered a solid quarter against a challenging macro environment. While we're pleased with this performance, we're most focused on the environment as we move forward. We'll discuss this more in a moment. What's happening inside Cisco, regardless of the macro, is an unrelenting focus on driving innovation, transforming our business and exceeding our customers' expectations. In Q1, as you've seen, we had revenue growth of 2% and  double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth. We also delivered strong non-GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP operating margins, along with solid operating cash flow. We continue to invest in innovation and expand our market opportunities, while maintaining our commitment to maximizing shareholder return. Over the last year, many of you have heard me talk about the resilience of the global macro environment. However, on our last earnings call, we indicated that we had begun to see some weakness, and that weakness continued throughout Q1 and was more broad-based. While the main challenges continue to be service provider and emerging markets, this quarter, we also saw relative weakness in enterprise and commercial. Despite these headwinds and because of key decisions we made 4 years ago to change our business model, we remain well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities across cloud, automation, 5G, Security and Collaboration. Our transition to software continues to progress, and we are on track with where we said we would be at the end of fiscal year 2020. This transition to software not only aligns to how our customers want to consume our technology but we also believe it will lessen the impact of macroeconomic shifts in the future. Despite the current uncertainty, our innovation pipeline remains strong. At our annual partner summit last week, we announced several exciting additions to our portfolio, including network automation and analytics, cloud-based networking, Collaboration as well as new Security capabilities. Over the next couple of months, you will see us deliver even more innovation to help our customers achieve their business objectives. Now I'd like to share some recent highlights across the business. Our Enterprise Networking portfolio continued to grow as customers increasingly adopt our intent-based networking portfolio, spanning our Catalyst 9000 family of switches, Meraki cloud-based platforms and next-generation data center solutions. Our customers today are running applications across multiple cloud environments, and this shift requires a fundamental change in how they build their networks and their security architectures. To help them achieve this, we are automating connectivity across any cloud. A good example of this is our recently announced partnership with Microsoft to help our customers improve network connectivity with the highest level of security, from branch offices to cloud-based applications, by integrating Cisco's SD-WAN solution with Azure's virtual WAN. To further extend our enterprise networking leadership, we continue to expand our cloud-managed network and security offerings. Last week, we also announced an expansion of our Meraki portfolio, including continued integration between Meraki's Dashboard and Cisco's Switching portfolio as well as innovative new LTE-based WAN connectivity solutions. We believe our planned acquisition of Acacia will also play a critical role in building upon the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio. By utilizing our innovations across silicon, software and optics, we are enabling our customers to transform their networks. Now let's turn to Security, which is always at the heart of everything we do. It's deeply integrated into the fabric of our entire portfolio to help secure our customers' data and address their modern application in multi-cloud environments. Cybersecurity continues to be a top concern for our customers as they evolve their enterprise architectures to address the challenges of an ever-changing threat environment. We have the most comprehensive integrated cybersecurity platform in the market, designed to enable our customers to securely connect any application running on any cloud and delivered to any device. We have been building an expansive Zero Trust framework for securing access across the workforce, the workplace and the workload. As the leader in Zero Trust, our customers are increasingly turning to us to help them extend simple and trusted access to their users in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. This is leading to strong uptake of Duo, our identity access management solution, which provides continuous authentication, ensuring the right people are able to access the right applications. To further reduce complexity in our customers' environments, we recently announced new enhanced capabilities in our firewall, breach defense, endpoint protection and Talos incident response solutions. These innovations are designed to provide greater threat protection and enhance the benefits of our platform. We also continue to leverage AI and ML capabilities through our industry-leading threat intelligence platform, Talos, along with Stealthwatch and Umbrella, to bring our customers simplicity, visibility and insight that no other company can deliver. Moving to Applications. We are rapidly becoming the center of our customer strategy for empowering teams and increasing productivity as 95% of the Fortune 500 use our Collaboration portfolio. This is leading to the solid performance in our business as a growing number of customers adopt our unique solutions. During the quarter, we expanded our offerings to empower our customers for the modern workplace, protecting data from ever-increasing cyber threats and delivering highly secure productivity and collaboration solutions. A good example of this is our next-generation WebEx, our cloud-based team collaboration platform, enabling better teamwork while helping users stay secure with integrated end-to-end encryption. We also launched single platform, Advantage, delivering all collaboration workloads, including calling, messaging, meeting and contact center from a single platform. In addition, we announced our new Cisco Webex Edge for devices as well as hardware-as-a-service options for phones, desk and room-based video systems. We are raising the bar for the industry by continuing to drive innovation in our expanding family of cognitive collaboration offers with AI and ML integrated capabilities. During the quarter, we acquired CloudCherry, a market-leading customer experience management solution, to augment our contact center portfolio with cloud analytics and AI to increase productivity and enhance user experiences. We also achieved a strong quarter in our AppDynamics business with yet another quarter of double-digit growth. Our investments in AppDynamics have made Cisco the leader in application monitoring and analytics. We are helping our customers transform their digital businesses through our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that turns data into actionable real-time insights by linking application performance to business outcomes. To summarize, while we remain in a challenging macroeconomic environment, I'm proud of our progress, both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to drive their own transformation and shift to the cloud. We have a clear vision and strategy and are executing well against it to capture the many opportunities ahead. I feel great about our portfolio, and I believe fully in our customers' commitment to our technology solutions. We will also continue to invest in organic and inorganic innovation to position Cisco for the long term. We also remain committed to managing our business to ensure we drive the greatest long-term value for our customers, employees, partners and shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Kelly. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q2. Our overall Q1 results were solid. We executed well with revenue growth and strong margins, net income and EPS. Total revenue was $13.2 billion, up 2%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.6%, up 1.3 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, up 5%. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.84, up 12%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was up 1% to $9.9 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 1%. All of the businesses were up except for routing. Switching had growth in both campus and data center with the continued ramp of the Cat 9K and strength of the Nexus 9K. Wireless grew, driven by Meraki. Data center had solid growth, led by HyperFlex. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. Applications was up 6%, with growth across all the businesses, including double-digit growth in AppDynamics. Security was up 22% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat, unified threat and web security. Service revenue was up 4%, driven by software and solution support. And we continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 71% of total software revenue, up 12 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q1 results year-over-year, there was a 50 basis point positive impact on revenue. In terms of orders in Q1, total products orders were down 4%. Looking at the geographies, Americas and EMEA were each down 3%, and APJC was down 5%. Total emerging markets were down 13%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 26%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 6%, enterprise and commercial were each down 5%, and service provider was down 13%. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q1 were $24.9 billion, up 11%. RPO is our total deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred and represents total committed noncancelable future revenue. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 65.9%, up 1.7 points; product gross margin was 66.1%, up 2.5 points; and service gross margin was 65.4%, down 0.4 points. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q1 net income was $2.9 billion and EPS was $0.68. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $28 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.6 billion, down 5%. Normalized for the $400 million legal settlement we received from Arista in Q1 of fiscal '19, operating cash flow was up 7%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we closed 4 acquisitions, all in the Applications area. These moves are consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. To summarize, we had a solid Q1. We executed well with top line growth and strong profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 3% to minus 5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.75 to $0.77. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions) Michelle, I'll turn it over to you.","Okay. Thanks, Ittai. So yes, what we -- if you recall on the last earnings call, I did say that we began to see some early signs of some macro impact towards the end of Q4. And then we just basically saw that continue throughout the quarter. And as obviously, the entire quarter was worse than we had expected when we began. And it was fairly broad-based. It was -- I mean, Kelly just read the regional numbers off from an orders perspective. So you saw negative 3, negative 3, negative 5 from Americas, EMEA and Asia. I'd say, across the technology areas, it was pretty broad-based. The segments that we saw, public sector continued to be strong, but the rest were -- enterprise commercial did weaken. Service provider in emerging markets, which were stressed last quarter, were about the same. We had shown the ability to offset that with strength in these -- in commercial and enterprise and public sector. And when those weakened, obviously, this quarter, that impacted our ability to offset them. And while I won't let my team make this excuse, it also had to happen in a quarter where we did have incredibly tough compares. So this is the worst quarter it could have occurred for us. So -- but that's really what we saw. As far as what we've modeled going forward, we're -- we've effectively assumed that it will stay as is. I don't think -- we haven't modeled any material further deterioration or improvement, I think, in what we put forward today. Kelly, is it fair? That's right. Samik, thanks for the question. So from the customers, it feels like there's not a broad-based loud noise out there. It feels like there's a bit of a pause. We saw things like conversion rates on our pipeline were lower than normal, which says that things didn't close the way we would have historically seen it. We didn't see any incremental loss ratios. It was really just stuff slipping. We saw some large deals get done but got done smaller. Kelly and I were involved in a couple personally that we saw that when we began talking to the customers about the transactions, and by the time they got done, they were smaller than when we had begun. So that happened. And then we just saw deals that slipped. And so we saw a little bit of all that. But it's not -- I'd say we also had our teams telling us that the approval process in several customers across a different number of industries were changing, which is usually indicative of, hey, let's add another signature requirement because we want to just put another set of eyes on every expenditure right now. So those are the things we've seen. And unfortunately, I've done this long enough that I've seen it before, so you recognize it when you see it, and that's really effectively what we saw during the quarter. And China, Kelly, was -- exact number. China continues its decline. It was down 31% versus last quarter. It was down 26%. So the momentum is continuing to just accelerate the decline in China. Yes. So let me take those. So on price, we had a really very, very good quarter on price. It is the lowest in some time in terms of the least amount of price erosion. So from an impact on our product gross margin rate, Paul, which is I know the metric you're looking at, it was only 40 basis points. Now I will say that's great. And I think we've done a lot of great things on our pricing. For example, we've been selectively -- where we have price elasticity, we'll raise prices and we've been effective on driving some product transitions and we've been realizing that benefit. I will say, we are starting to see -- we didn't feel the impact of it this quarter, but we are starting to see pricing pressure in the server market that we expect to accelerate next quarter, but that's, of course, included in the guide. But for Q1, it was a very, very strong pricing quarter, which has been fantastic. From an OpEx perspective, if you play down the ranges I just gave you, it does show that OpEx will be down on how you're thinking about it. And yes, we are managing it like we always do, which is balancing the investments we're making, plus driving trade-off and cost out. So you're looking at it correctly, and that's what we're driving it to. So let me break down the margins overall because I think that is the key question. I would say our margins are -- there's positives certainly driving the margin increase that you're seeing, and you're seeing that in the guide. On the positive side, we are definitely feeling the positive impact of the software mix on our margins. So that is driving benefit to us, just purely on the increased software content that we have and what we're selling. So that's helping tremendously. I do think we're going to see some more pricing erosion as we go forward for some of the things that are specific, like, of course, the server market's going to get tougher now that the DRAM prices are going down. So that will be a little bit of a negative next quarter, but that's okay. And then, of course, we are still benefiting from the DRAM price decrease related to the server market that we started to feel the benefit of a couple of quarters ago. It's a very large impact this quarter, favorable to us. That will -- I expect to continue next quarter. But after that, as you recall, we started seeing the benefit in Q3 of '19. So that will become less of a year-over-year favorability for us. And then we'll see what happens to pricing there. So net-net to your question, I don't think it will stay at this OM rate that we delivered in Q1, which is the highest it's been, because of those key things, but the underlying trends are all going in the right direction with software that's benefiting it and driving the favorable mix and then the real strong product management we're doing around managing price elasticity. I'm wondering, Chuck or Kelly, or maybe both of you, if you can talk a little bit about the order growth versus your current expectations for economic development. Clearly, Chuck, as you pointed out, and Kelly, the -- we saw weakness kind of across the board in orders. But if we think about kind of a relatively flat environment from here going forward, as you said you're forecasting on, how long does it take us to start to get to more of a flattish and then even recovering order book in that kind of scenario and environment? Kelly, I'll let you handle that. Thanks, boss. James, that's a tough question, right? I mean, I'd say, certainly, these headwinds we have right now are going to be with us, I think, in the short term, right? And again, whether it's just -- I don't see any catalyst to change the momentum right now with the uncertainty and business confidence in the macro, like talk -- like Chuck talked about. I do think, from a portfolio perspective, obviously, we feel good about the portfolio. And you're seeing still, regardless of the macro, the improvement we're making on the software metrics. That continues regardless. Going forward, we do have easier compares as the second half comes around, not that that's a big victory, but that is the reality. And I think we're just going to keep executing through whatever the macro is. I don't know what you want to add, Chuck? Yes, James, I would say that if you just go around the world right now and you look at what's happening in Hong Kong, and you look at the China-U.S. trade situation, you look at what's going on in D.C., you've got Brexit, you've got uncertainty in Latin America, I mean, I think it's -- and any of those that are big issues, if they get resolved, then you could see some of the uncertainty removed, and I think that's what -- business confidence just suffers when there's lack of clarity. And there's been lack of clarity for so long that I think it finally just came into play. So I think you're probably able to guess that as well as we are based on some of these bigger issues sort of coming to some level of conclusion. And then obviously, we have the elections coming in next year that we'll have to see how they work. But I will reiterate what Kelly said, despite the order growth rate, this software transition that we've been embarking on is going exactly as we planned. It continued this quarter. We had solid results in our software portfolio again this quarter. And we put up some numbers at our analyst conference that we said we would hit by the end of 2020. We're on track to get there. So we feel good about that, and we're going to keep on executing. I think the teams have done a phenomenal job of getting our portfolio in the position that it's at. And that's why I said I have full confidence that our customers are committed to these technologies. Just because they pause and we see a slowdown in 1 quarter, I think for the long term, we're in good shape, and I feel good about where we are. Yes. Rod, that was one of the big -- it's a good question. That was one of the big signals to us that this thing is -- that there's definitely something going on because the commercial business is usually fairly resilient. And it was broad-based across the globe in each of the regions. I think all 3 were negative, right, Kelly? Yes. Yes. So it was broad-based. But I think that will also be one of the first to bounce back when we start seeing that come back. That's a good sign. I wonder if you could provide more color on what you're seeing in the U.S. Service Provider business? And also more broadly, how you're thinking about the Service Provider vertical going forward? Obviously, it's been weak for a while, but assuming that environment stays that way, are there product refreshes and so forthcoming down the pipe that can better the year-over-year trends? Yes, Tejas, it's a good question. So in the U.S., I think it's pretty clear, if you just follow what's going on with the major players here, is -- and we talked about this on the last call, that they're currently focused on building out their trials and then their broader consumer-based 5G services. And that's an area that they'll -- frankly, they'll run most of that traffic across their existing networks. We've said that when they begin to build out the broad-based enterprise service delivery 5G networks, that that's where we would really come into play on helping reengineer backbones for higher throughput and more traffic. And I would suspect that we'll see them start to do some of that maybe in the second half of 2020. We'll have to see how fast they get moving. And we have some announcements coming over the next couple of months that I think line up with what they're trying to accomplish. And so we'll see how it moves. But we -- that's the transition that we would be looking for that could help get this business to a little better position. It was -- and on a global basis, I'll tell you it was weak. It was -- it got much weaker in Europe. It was about the same in the U.S., I think. And we had some pockets of strength in Asia, outside of China. We had some strength in -- particularly in Japan. So as we've always said about this business, it's so big deal driven. But right now, I think that's the story of what we see. Yes, Tal, it's a good question. That's actually what we spend every day doing. I will tell you that we saw strength -- continued strength in the campus refresh in the portfolio that we brought forward there, which, obviously, if you think about what we've been doing over the last couple of years, and I made a comment in my opening remarks about this, is we have now transitioned our entire enterprise networking portfolio to a mandatory subscription model. And those products and that -- those areas -- those new products are still -- they're growing very strongly right now as customers continue to deploy. So one of the big things we want to do is continue to transition towards this software model. We had 30 years of a net 30 CapEx model. So it's -- we're in the midst of that transition. We're making progress on the time line that we expected. That's the biggest strategic thing I think we can do. From a portfolio perspective, I think you have -- if you go across the portfolio, we made a lot of new announcements last week. We've got new announcements coming up. And I think that, clearly, we have a lot of customers that are still buying a lot of stuff. So while there's a slowdown, I think there's still meaningful value that our customers are seeing with our technology, and we'll continue to do everything we can to try to find those areas that resonate the most right now. I think you see it with security, given the importance of that technology to them. And we're working on some other things that we haven't announced yet. So we're going to continue to do all the things that you described. Obviously, you laid out a lot of the details about the challenges. When we look back historically over Cisco, their history, the last time we kind of saw such negative trends were kind of July 2017. It was kind of about a 4-quarter pause before recovery. Is there anything different about it this time? And some people will say, well, white box is starting to hurt you a lot. Is it white box? Is it generally macro? Or why wouldn't it be like 4 quarters, like what we saw last year in 2017? Yes. I -- first of all, I think that given the broad-based and the rapid change that we saw, I don't believe it's anything like white box or anything like that. It's broad across the portfolio. It's broad across geographies. And we're -- as Kelly said, obviously, in the second half, we don't like to talk about comps, but the math is different in the second half of the year. But we also have all the things that I just talked about with Tal. We also have this Wi-Fi 6 transition. At some point, we will have some spending going on around the 5G backbone transitions. We got 400-gig coming next year. So there are a lot of things. And I also believe that our customers, they will pause for a while, but technology is so absolutely core to their fundamental strategies that it just seems to me that the time that they're going to be able to pause is going to be shorter than what you would have seen in the past. I mean they worry about their competitors' investments. They worry about falling behind. So I think they'll hit the pause button because of all the uncertainty. I think we have to just see how long it lasts in today's world given the strategic value of all the technology. And frankly, everything that we're building is incredibly important to them as they deal with this new cloud world and rearchitecting their traffic flows and their security architecture, and there's only so long they're going to be able to pause on doing that. But we'll see how it turns out. Yes, I'll take that one. I'd say what we laid out is, we said, by the end of '20, we should have 30% of our revenue be software, and software and services be 50%. So that's the metric that we are pacing towards. And your 20% number, we are already past. So we are driving to be at that 30% by the end of this year. So like Chuck mentioned, we are pacing well with that. This transition that we're driving has greatly increased the amount of software we are selling with our system. So that is all going well. Yes, I think if you just think what Kelly said, by the end of 2020, our target was to be at 30% of our revenue coming from software. And if you also correlate the metric we shared today, which is in Q1, 71% of our software was coming from subscription and SaaS, which 4 years ago, that number was probably 1/3 or less. So that's the nature of the success of the transition that we've been driving so far. Yes, it's a good point. Actually, the target for the end of '20 for that was to be 66%. So we've passed that metric already. Yes, that too. Yes. Yes, on that one, subscription, meaning, yes, so if I sell a Catalyst 9K switch now, it's sold with a subscription that gets renewed 3 or 5 years, depending on the term from now. So that's what we're talking about. So of all the software we're selling, is it based on a term-based value that gets renewed. Yes. And Jim, just to give you a little sense of where we are, I mean, we're still -- we're seeing very strong growth year-over-year in those platforms. The transition's happening from the old to the new, just like we would have expected. And we were actually talking about yesterday how we would answer the question relative to where we are in this. Because I think I said last time, we were in the second inning, and we joked that maybe we're in the bottom of the second inning now. But we're still very early in this transition and it's going very well. And we now have the entire enterprise networking portfolio in refresh mode with Wi-Fi 6 access points with the new Catalyst 9000. And then one of the things we announced last week was the ability to manage the Cat 9K, one of the products in the Cat 9K, onto the Meraki platform, so customers could take advantage of it. And we'll continue to extend that across the other portfolio of products. So it's going very well, and it's still early. So let me just wrap up and say that, obviously, it's a complicated world right now, and we certainly felt the continuing impact that we talked about at the end of our last quarter. That being said, I have great confidence in where we are with the portfolio. We shared some metrics today on the software transition that I think is going incredibly well. And notwithstanding the short-term challenges, we feel really good about the future. And so thank you all for being with us today. And I'll kick it back to you, Marilyn. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2020 second quarter results, will be on Wednesday, February 12, 2020, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations department, and we thank you very much for joining the call today.","Chuck, maybe I'll -- you can kind of walk us through a little bit, kind of how the quarter evolved as far as the demand pattern. You've talked about weakness became, first of all, more broad-based, but also started into the enterprise and commercial. Any more color you could give us there, either from a product or regional standpoint? And with regards to your working assumptions into the next quarter, into the January quarter, is it your assumption that the intensity of the softness you're seeing right now will just take as is or getting worse? Help us think about the framework you have in mind when you give the guidance. Chuck, thanks for the detail on the last question. I just wanted to get a sense of what you're hearing from your customers in terms of, are you hearing that if some of the trade aspects of -- that are depressing the macro get resolved, do you expect some of them to come back in terms of spending? What are you hearing from your customers? And if you can give us an update on the order trends in China as well, that would be helpful. Kelly, if you could tell us the pricing. I know we're going to see it in the Q, but if you could tell us the rate of price erosion, if there was any change? And then, if I did the math correctly on OpEx, it looks like your guidance would suggest around $3.8 billion for the January quarter. That would be down $400 million sequentially and $150 million year-over-year. Do I have that right? Is that the way you're thinking about it? And related to that, how should we think about OpEx going forward throughout the year? How do you plan to manage expenses given the less-than-expected revenue outlook? Kelly, the real question, can operating margin go up with revenue being slightly down? Can you drive higher operating margin? I wanted to ask about the commercial order rate deterioration. I think last quarter, you guys hadn't really seen much deterioration at that at the end of the quarter. And then I'm assuming through this quarter, it's been getting worse. But wondering if you could just comment on what you're seeing there in that particular market? And regionally, are you seeing -- is it mainly in the U.S. where you see that weakness? Do you see the weakness all over the place? Just any further color you could give there would be helpful. So if I take a 5-quarter view, 6-quarter view on your results, not just this quarter or the guidance, I see constant deterioration in the growth rate. Organically, from about 4.5%, now we're getting to minus 5%, or I have to look exactly at the guidance where we are. And the question I have is not about the environment, but rather, about the portfolio. If you ignore the environment as much as we can, what can you do with the portfolio in order to change the trend line and reaccelerate the growth? Maybe even start with, can you identify what are the weak areas versus what are the strong areas? And then what's in your power to change versus something that may take longer? I want to go back to kind of the comments earlier made around kind of the software expansion and kind of progressing to what you had laid out at past analyst days. If I recall, it seemed to kind of map out that you would have about 20% of your total kind of revenue being -- product revenue being contributed from software. As we think about the product portfolio and the push to subscription, is that the right trajectory to think about? And as we look even beyond that, could you see an even higher mix of kind of just recurring nature of your business. I'm just trying to understand what more is left to kind of build out the product portfolio around this kind of subscription motion for the company? I was just hoping to get more color on sort of the campus switching cycle with the Cat 9K and just kind of where you think we are, especially with large enterprises as that really drives, it seems like, more of the growth of the business anyways. And just trying to understand that. And then just to make sure that we're thinking about it correct, when you're talking subscription within this business line, you're talking more of a term license than kind of recurring monthly, correct?

CSCO,Q4 2020,3143,3263,1524,"Thanks, Sue. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal '20 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In Q2 fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business. As such, all of the financial information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Thank you, Marilyn. We hope all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Our thoughts remain with everyone who has been affected by the pandemic, and we are grateful to those who remain on the front lines, working to help those impacted during these challenging times. As we've been preparing for this call, it's offered me some time to reflect on what we've achieved since I stepped into this role 5 years ago. Through the hard work of everyone at Cisco, we have undergone a significant transformation in the midst of some of the most complex times in our history. I am so proud of what our teams have accomplished. They have demonstrated resiliency, determination and compassion as we delivered on our financial commitments, brought market-leading innovation to our customers, transitioned our business model and driven a culture that has truly shined over the past 6 months. The Cisco of today is more agile, innovative and focused. Through both organic and inorganic innovation, we delivered incredible new technology with new, more flexible consumption offers for our customers with more software and subscriptions. At our financial analyst conference in 2017, we laid out key metrics for our transformation. We set a goal of 30% of our revenue to come from software. And while we achieved 29% in fiscal year '20, we did achieve 31% in Q4. We also delivered 51% of our revenue from software and services in FY '20, exceeding our target of 50%. Lastly, we now have 78% of our software revenue sold as subscription, beating our target of 66%. With our customers as our guide, we have successfully executed against our strategy to help them transform and modernize their organizations. We launched our intent-based networking architecture using automation and machine learning to help our customers drive simplicity and cost-effective management of their networks. As customers move more workloads to the cloud, we're offering fast, highly secure access to applications hosted anywhere, in the private data center, public cloud or a SaaS platform, with our cloud security integrated with our SD-WAN solution. We introduced new capabilities across software, silicon and optics to help bring to life the Internet for the future. The innovation we've driven in our Security portfolio has helped us become the top enterprise security company in the world. With Webex, we have the most trusted secure platform for remote collaboration for the enterprise. And we're also delivering real-time insights for customers in their multi-cloud environments to optimize user experience with our insights and observability assets like AppDynamics. Over the past few years, this transition has resulted in improvements in our financial performance, including expanding margins and demonstrating continued financial discipline. Once again, I want to thank our teams for what we've achieved. If the past year has taught us anything, it's the need to always be nimble. I believe that the changes we've made to our business now put us in a position of strength as we focus on our future. We're a company that embraces change, and we've shown our ability to thrive in any environment. The past 6 months have unquestionably reshaped our world. Industries, governments and work have changed dramatically, and many of these changes will become permanent. At Cisco, we are committed to helping our customers truly digitize their organizations for the future regardless of the challenges or fundamental shifts that we may face. Like many other organizations, we've also had the opportunity to reexamine our business and our portfolio for this new world. As I said last quarter, we were going to take time to better understand the short- and long-term implications of COVID-19, and we now believe we have a better view. Based on the many conversations we've had with our customers around the world, we believe we have perspective into how they will adapt their technology strategies for the future to ensure greater resiliency, agility and innovation. We know how to adapt our business and strategy to align with where our customers are headed. The changes we are making to our business reflect how we are leveraging our existing strengths, investing for growth and unlocking new opportunities. We will also be very disciplined on our cost structure, as we always have been. Over the next few quarters, we will be taking out over $1 billion on an annualized basis to reduce our cost structure. At the same time, we're going to rebalance our R&D investments to focus on key areas that will position us well for the future. More specifically, we will accelerate the transition of the majority of our portfolio to be delivered as a service. We will also accelerate our investments in the following areas: cloud security, cloud collaboration; key enhancements for education, health care and other industries; increased automation in the enterprise; the future of work; and application insights and analytics. At the same time, we will continue our focus in the following areas, many of which have been accelerated by the pandemic: multi-cloud investment, 5G and WiFi 6, 400 gig, optical networking, next-generation silicon, AI and more. These investments will help define the next phase of our transformation and allow us to bring the best, most relevant innovation to our customers in simpler, more easily consumable ways. I am confident that, once again, we have the right strategy that will deliver what our customers need from us, and we will emerge from this challenging time as a stronger company than before. Now let me discuss our performance in the quarter. While our results reflect the ongoing challenges in the current environment, we executed well. As you would expect, the pandemic has had the most impact on our enterprise and commercial orders driven by an overall slowdown in spending. We are seeing customers continue to delay their purchasing decisions in certain areas while increasing spend in others until they have greater visibility and clarity on the timing and shape of the global economic recovery. Despite this challenging economic environment, the pandemic has also triggered a massive and rapid shift to remote operations and automation to maximize personal safety. With this, many customers are increasingly reliant on our broad portfolio of technologies, resulting in another quarter of strong demand for our Catalyst 9000, Security, Webex and other SaaS-based solutions. Throughout fiscal year 2020, we demonstrated operational resilience based on our strong customer relationships, a solid financial foundation, differentiated innovation and a compelling strategic transformation built on the strength of our key technology platforms. Now I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter. In June, we introduced an expanded business resiliency portfolio, offering health care and education solutions with simpler consumption models and services to accelerate adoption. We will continue to expand this portfolio to cover areas such as social distancing in the workplace, effective virtual employee engagement at scale and pop-up connected clinics. Within our Infrastructure Platforms business, we continue to see a strong ramp of our Catalyst 9K portfolio as many customers take advantage of their employees working from home to refresh their aging infrastructure, enabling them to simplify, secure and automate the management of their networks. Our acquisition of ThousandEyes will complement these capabilities by adding deeper and broader visibility and analytics across networks and applications, enabling us to deliver the best possible experiences for our customers. By integrating their SaaS-based offering with our AppDynamics application intelligence portfolio and SD-WAN technology, we can provide unparalleled intelligence and insights at cloud scale, driving improved customer experience as well as reliability of their applications. Security continues to be a top priority for our customers, particularly in this distributed digital world. Our ability to connect and protect our customers working from anywhere on any device is accelerating the adoption of our comprehensive Security portfolio, resulting in double-digit revenue growth this quarter. As more data goes to the cloud and users become more distributed, we had good momentum in our cloud security solutions, protecting workloads, applications and data. We also continue to expand our capabilities to enable simplification and automation of our customer security infrastructure. A good example of this is our SecureX platform, which is designed to unify visibility, enable automation and deliver a consistent experience. Since our launch 6 weeks ago, we have over 2,100 active daily customers, 2/3 of which have 2 or more products active. We're also delivering secure remote worker solutions that span our endpoint security portfolio combined with the power of our Zero Trust architecture with Duo, AnyConnect, Umbrella and AMP for Endpoints. Applications have become a lifeline for so many organizations, and this has only increased over the past few months. As organizations define what their future looks like, our collaboration technology will play a key role in evolving how they work, transact and connect. Webex had strong performance this quarter with double-digit growth as businesses, governments, educators and frontline workers everywhere have embraced remote work. We expect this momentum to continue as we have begun to see the conversion of free trials into paid subscriptions. AppDynamics also achieved another solid quarter. These monitoring tools offer our customers great value by providing real-time insights from a single pane of glass to optimize user experience in their multi-cloud environments. As we think about all that we've achieved over the past 5 years, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Kelly Kramer, our Chief Financial Officer, who has been an incredible partner to me. She has played a key role in reshaping Cisco into the company we are today. I want to let you all know that Kelly has made the decision to retire from Cisco. Over her 8-plus years here, Kelly has led the effort to improve our financial performance, focused on investor confidence and help position Cisco for success. Kelly and I have been focused on simple, clear communication, absolute transparency, delivering on our commitments and always aligning Cisco for future growth. Kelly has graciously agreed to stay on as CFO until we have her successor on board and will advise us with the succession process. I can assure you that with Kelly staying on during the search and with our world-class finance team, we will have a seamless transition. Kelly, thank you so much for your partnership and your friendship. You will truly be missed. Now before I turn it over to Kelly, I want to reiterate my confidence for what the future holds. Over the past 5 years, we have not shied away from making bold moves to position us for long-term growth, and now is no different. We are committed to running a strong business as well as leveraging technology for good to solve the world's biggest challenges and create new opportunities for the future. As we've demonstrated, we have helped our customers build resiliency in difficult environments through industry disruptions and in times of rapid growth. We will also continue to use our position to make our communities and world a better place. Whether it's tackling the global health pandemic or social injustice and intolerance, we are committed to our purpose of powering an inclusive future for all. As we start a new fiscal year, I believe we have incredible opportunities in front of us. We will navigate the pandemic in the most effective way possible while not damaging the long-term prospects for Cisco. We remain strongly aligned to our customers' priorities and deeply committed to delivering long-term growth. Now I'll turn it over to Kelly. Thanks, Chuck. It really has been great, and I want to thank you, the leadership team and really all of Cisco. I also want to thank my finance team who does an amazing job. I'll certainly miss Cisco, but I'm looking forward to what's next. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full year, followed by guidance for Q1. Our overall Q4 results reflect good execution with strong margins in a very challenging environment. Total revenue was $12.2 billion, down 9%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33%, up 0.4 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 5% year-over-year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, down 4%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was down 13% to $8.8 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 16%. This is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. We saw declines across switching, routing, data center and wireless driven primarily by the weakness we saw in the commercial and enterprise markets. We did see pockets of strength with the continued growth of Cat 9K, which was up double digits, and the ramp of our WiFi 6 products. Data center was particularly weak with the decline of the market and DRAM price declines. Applications was down 9%. On the positive side, we saw a strong double-digit growth in Webex with the importance of remote working. We also saw solid growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. This was offset by declines in Unified Communication and TP endpoints. Security was up 10% with strong performance in network security, identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management. Our cloud security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was flat for the quarter, but we had growth in our maintenance business as well as software and support services. This was offset by our advisory services, which was impacted by the COVID environment. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 78% of total software revenue, up 8 points year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q4 were $28.4 billion, up 12%. RPO for product was up 17%, and service was up 9%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of software and services. In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders were down 10%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 11%. EMEA was down 6%, and APJC was down 13%. Total emerging markets were down 19%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 26%. In our customer segments, public sector was down 1%, while enterprise was down 7%. Commercial was down 23%, and service provider was down 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 65%, down 0.5 points. Product gross margin was 63.2%, down 1.5 points. And service gross margin was 69.8%, up 1.9 points year-over-year. Our Q4 GAAP tax rate was 16.7%, which reflects the true-ups to the annual tax rate. In terms of the bottom line, from a GAAP perspective, Q4 net income was $2.6 billion, and EPS was $0.62. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $29.4 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, down 4% year-over-year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders for our quarterly dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. Just last week, we closed our acquisition of ThousandEyes. This move is consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. I'll now cover the full fiscal year results. We delivered strong margins and grew EPS in a very challenging environment. Revenue was $49.3 billion, down 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 66%, up 1.4 points. And our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.8%, up 1.5 points. From a bottom line perspective, non-GAAP net income was $13.7 billion, down 1%. And non-GAAP EPS was $3.21, up 4%. GAAP net income was $11.2 billion, and GAAP EPS was $2.64. We delivered operating cash flow of $15.4 billion, down 3%. Normalized for the cash received in Q1 fiscal '19 related to the legal settlement with Arista, operating cash flow was flat for fiscal '20. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $8.6 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represents 59% of our free cash flow. That was comprised of $2.6 billion of share repurchases and $6 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and the fiscal year with strong margins in a very challenging environment. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 9% to minus 11% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.69 to $0.71. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Sue, we'll now open up the queue for questions. (Operator Instructions) Sue, I'll turn it over to you.","Yes. Sami, thanks for the question. And it's been a pretty successful 3 years as we've been making this transition, and we obviously still have ways to go, to your question, relative to a new target. We were talking about this in the last week or so. And we feel like we just need to get through this pandemic cycle that we have, and then we'll set some new targets, and we'll communicate them to you at that time. So we don't have one yet. Yes. Thanks, Meta. I think that when we think about the network architectures, I think one thing we know is that the -- our customers are living in this multi-cloud environment. And as they went into this work-from-home environment, as I said on our last call, those who had technical debt and those who had not really invested in modernizing their infrastructure, they know they will need to do that, and they'll do it at different paces based on their financial abilities. I'd say that it's clear that many of our customers do want to consume the technology as a service. So we're currently looking at the entire portfolio to see what -- how deeply we can get into the portfolio relative to delivering as a service. And I think we'll have a lot of that in the marketplace by the end of the calendar year. We will also be working with our customers on their network architectures, which are certainly going to be prevalent on -- or dependent upon cloud security, on SD-WAN and the integration of those. So we're going to accelerate that as well as helping them navigate this multi-cloud world because I do think that we have seen some customers accelerate that shift as well. So the network architectures that we built 15 years ago, as I've talked about, just aren't relevant today because the traffic flows are completely different. And so we'll continue to work with customers, and I think it will be at a different pace just based on how they all come out and how they manage the pandemic. Yes. Ittai, it's a great question. And your first question around the areas that we feel like we need to invest, I think this pandemic is basically just -- it's just giving us the air cover to accelerate the transition of R&D expense into cloud security, cloud collab away from the on-prem aspects of the portfolio. Clearly, we've got a lot of technology that we're working on today to help our customers over the next 3, 4, 5 years in this multi-cloud world that they're going to live in. And you'll see more of that come out over the next couple of years. But on the M&A question, I think that there's clearly a recognition that the valuations of the assets that are attractive have achieved different levels. And so I think that we'll continue to be disciplined, but I would say that we're open to looking at the current world and the reality that we live in. So I think we're open to any and all ideas, and we continue to work through different options, and we have a list of potential targets that we maintain on a pretty regular basis. And so I think the real difference is -- there has to be a recognition that the valuations have changed, but we'll try to be disciplined and do the right thing at the right time. Well, I'll comment subjectively, and then I'll let Kelly talk a little bit about the numbers. I wouldn't say that we're coming out of the coronavirus right now. I think that it feels to me very much like it felt 90 days ago. And clearly, the -- in the U.S., we have not seen -- we've seen some areas that have gotten better and, obviously, some that have not. But I'd say in general, it feels pretty much the same as it did 90 days ago to us relative to that. I think that some of the things you're talking about around service providers around the world and the possibility where we would be getting opportunities that we wouldn't have had before, I think some of those are still to be seen. But we would share that optimism, and we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. Kelly, do you want to talk about the... Yes. And then from our compares, I mean, Q1 of '20, so my guide for this next quarter, in Q1 of '21, that's our toughest compare to the -- obviously, we had -- Q3 and Q4 were very, very tough for us in '20 because of COVID. So comparing to Q1 of '20 right now, we still have some tougher compares. But they do get easier as the year goes on, assuming that the pandemic ends. But as you know, Jim, we forecast based on what we see, based on the order rates, and we feel this is a pretty accurate guide. Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it. Yes. Paul, let me just tell you a little bit. I'll give you a little sort of customer segment and around-the-world view of what it's felt like in the last 90 days or so. So maybe that will help add a little color. In the U.S., in particular, I'd say the -- we saw some strength in the very high end of enterprise. And then sort of as you go down in the marketplace, we just -- the weakness got a little bit worse as you just sort went straight down, as you would expect with small business, medium business and even smaller-size enterprises that were -- didn't perform as well as the very largest of enterprises. But we did see strength in the very large enterprise in the U.S. We also saw some strength in federal in the U.S. clearly. And that was actually really promising because they had a very strong quarter a year ago. So they executed really well. Service provider around the world. If you look at Asia and Europe, our service provider business was positive in both of those regions. And it was just slightly negative in the U.S. It was primarily Canada and Mexico in the Americas that drove the negative here. So overall, that was a bright spot, particularly outside the United States. We did see countries -- a few countries that actually began to show some positives. And I'm trying to think through like can we build a model that says Asia went in first, and so they're going to come out first. And we did see Japan had a good quarter for us on the demand side. Korea had a good quarter for us on the demand side, and we're seeing some positives. Germany had a good quarter for us. And I'd say if we think about how our European team feels right now, they actually feel reasonably okay. Not great, great, but better than they did 90 days ago. The Americas is still sort of the wildcard, I'd say, that we see right now. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color around what we're seeing up and down the stack. And then, Kelly, do you want to... Yes. Sure. Where you'll see the cost coming out, I'd say, the majority is in OpEx. I'd say maybe an 80-20 split. We'll certainly have some in COGS, too, on that side, on the services side, but mostly in OpEx. And in terms of timing, we should see a lot of this -- most of this, the bulk of this coming out at the end of Q1 and a little bleeding over into Q2, depending on the country it's in. Thank you, Paul. Appreciate it. Well, I would say that -- I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll kick it to Kelly to give you a little bit more color. I think that as Kelly and I looked at where we expected demand to be from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, we were pretty much in line. In fact, it was a slight, slight, slight bit better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. But I would not get too excited about it being slightly better, as you can tell from the guide. But -- and then I think linearity was generally in line, but it was probably a little more back-end loaded than we've seen. And we had a lot of big enterprise activity towards the end of the quarter. So Kelly, anything to add? Yes. The only thing I'll add, and Chuck kind of touched on this -- I mean, again, it is the biggest, biggest premier enterprise accounts, they are still investing significantly and we -- they had very good order rates. But it does -- as you go down the tiers in enterprise, it did slow down and just -- and commercial is not surprising. You saw what the commercial numbers are. So I do think it is related to their waiting to see what comes out of the pandemic, and they're pausing their spends. But I think this is why seeing the big, big accounts still investing in their digital transformation, I think, gives us confidence that once we do get through this, we feel good about how we'll come out of it. Sure. Go ahead. Go ahead, Rod. I don't think that -- I haven't heard anything about anybody pulling anything forward. I think that the larger the companies are, the more confident they have in their ability to come out at some point. And they're going to continue to invest to position themselves when they come out. And clearly, there are some large enterprises that are not investing, given -- depending on which industries they're in. But I don't -- I think it was just -- I think it's just normal investment cycles that certain large companies have just decided they're going to continue to pursue. And I do think Kelly made a good point. As we've given like the number of software license agreements that we did, I mean, it says that the portfolio that we have and the strategy we have, I think, whether it's helping them with application visibility as they move more to the cloud, it's going to be more -- it's going to resonate even more. When you think about the security strategy we have, going to the cloud, it's going to be more required in the future. We look at this infrastructure transformation, as they deal with this multi-cloud world and these new traffic flows, I think that's going to be super relevant. And then obviously, the employee and customer experience that they have, which are all areas that we're investing in, I think when we come out of this, those will be even more in demand than they were when we went into it. We just got to get to the other side of it, and then I feel pretty good. Thanks, Simon. Yes. Simon, I'll let Kelly talk about the numbers in a minute, but I'm going to share with you my instinct on this because I thought about the same thing. Because the one thing that we know is that the campus business that we have, their -- people aren't in their campus offices. So the whole notion of refresh and upgrades clearly are not top of mind for every customer the way they might have been 9 months ago. However, what I think is that the 9K is for those customers who are either in the process of a real commitment to modernizing their infrastructure and they're continuing to do that or they've made a decision and they have the financial wherewithal right now to actually embark on that, and the 9K is what they are using to do that in their campus environments. And some of them are using this opportunity, with no one in their campus environments, to upgrade. Clearly, that's not every customer. But I think what it says is those customers who are still on our older platforms, which we didn't see the growth on, it's sort of the story we talked about. They haven't committed to refresh. They haven't committed to that modernization piece, and so they're not -- that part is not accelerating, but the 9K has continued to accelerate. So it's been a positive story for us. Kelly, do you want to answer the... No. I think you said it well. And I think, Simon, your point is well. I mean so the products you referenced, the Cat 9200, which was launched for the lower end -- the mid- to lower end, is in that commercial segment, to your point. But when I look at it individually, that product is still -- revenue is growing like amazing double digits. And so that just shows that we're still very early in the transition. What -- when the customers are buying, they are buying the new portfolio hand over fist. And it's just the COVID impact of the overall -- and again, the legacy products falling off is really what's driving, but that's why we have faith and feel good about the portfolio when we come out of the environment. Yes. Simon, I think 2 just comments on top of that. Number one is we're still very early in this whole process. And then the 9200, I think it's important to note, it is a small business product, but it's also an access layer product in enterprises. It goes into branches. It goes into, in some cases, wiring closets, et cetera. So we will still see some continued demand for that. Thanks, James. Well, I'll let Kelly answer the numbers question. We gave you the total software number. We gave you the percent that's coming from subscriptions and SaaS, but I think you're asking specifically about SaaS. So -- and look, I think that we've made a lot of progress. If you do the math on where the software in our portfolio was 5 years ago and what percentage of it was coming from subscription and SaaS, we've certainly increased it significantly over the last 4 or 5 years without any major, major revenue-driving acquisitions. So that would certainly help. And we continue -- as I said earlier, continue to look at alternatives in that space. And you should assume that we will continue to look at them, but we'll also be disciplined. So we'll -- Kelly, do you want to touch on the SaaS number or... Yes. I mean we don't disclose the total SaaS number. I mean, again, it's made up of our Webex business, a lot of our portfolio, Duo, Umbrella, in Security. And again, acquisition, Meraki is a hybrid, where we ship an appliance, but then it has the SaaS management. And things like ThousandEyes that we're adding to our networking portfolio and AppDynamics, I mean, that's just going to continue to accelerate. So I think you're going to see it twofold, right? You're going to continue to see us to be -- those are the type of assets that we have been acquiring, and we'll continue to acquire. And you're seeing internally, this is also how we are developing product to try to accelerate that. But the growth in the SaaS portfolio has been really good for us. Thanks, James. Yes. Jeff, thanks for asking the question. I would have been in trouble if I've gotten off this call and not talk about the web scale. So we saw another positive quarter. So that's one of the areas that was really positive for us. It was a third quarter in a row where we've had double-digit growth with the web scale players. And again, as I said last quarter, it's -- we have had some traction with the 8K, some traction with our silicon, but nothing that's meaningfully moving the numbers yet. So it really is just the rest of the portfolio. But as I said, I think it speaks to the long-term effort that we've put in over the last few years of rebuilding these relationships. And I think it speaks to their belief in our strategy going forward. And we feel good about where we are. And we believe over the next 1 to 2 years that they'll begin to be meaningful contributors. And we're excited about what we -- what the teams have done. And on the cost out. So it's -- again, we are taking out gross over $1 billion. So that is gross. But like anything, Jeff, there's puts and takes as we go forward. So whether it's things like the dollars, weaker FX, it's going to be a bit of a headwind this year. We reset the bonus, all that kind of stuff, that will be puts and takes. But that's -- it's a real cost out that we're taking out as we go through into our planning. Literally, we're looking at everything. I mean we're trying to -- we're looking at everything from our compute portfolio to -- clearly, our software assets are already in the midst of that transition, and many of them are already being sold that way. And we're even looking at how we deliver our traditional networking hardware as a service over time. So it is literally across the portfolio. And then we see an acceleration of some of the work that's already been underway. Obviously, the Collaboration portfolio has been transitioning to as a service for quite a while. We even launched last -- I don't know, 2, 3 quarters ago, we launched our hardware as a service and the Collaboration portfolio as a pilot. And we've been working hard on all the operational capabilities and the systems work that needs to be done to do that. So it literally is across the entire portfolio. And we'll give you an update on the next call, for sure. Right. I believe that was our last question. Thanks, George. I'll turn it back to you, Chuck. All right. I just want to recap and just thank, first of all, Kelly, for everything and the friendship and all the great work that you've done and reiterate that she's going to stay with us until we actually identify her successor. And she'll help advise us through that process. So we're excited about her sticking around and helping us do that. I want to thank the team for executing through a really challenging time. And I really want to reiterate that I think the strategy that we had going in, I believe when we come out of the pandemic, will be more relevant to our customers than it was 6, 9 months ago. So I'm optimistic about the future. And we're going to continue to execute through this. And thank you all for joining us today. Great. Thank you, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2021 first quarter results will be on Thursday, November 12, 2020, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call, but if you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations group. And we thank you very much for joining today's call.","My first question is for the team here. And just wanted to know that now that you've achieved the 50% of revenue coming from software and services, and that was the guidepost given at the 2017 Analyst Day, do you guys have a new target in mind and new range? I know you guys introduced some new products and new services and some new investment areas. I'm just hoping to understand it seems you get maybe a new road map or a new target that we should hold you guys or measure you against. Great. Chuck, you referred to kind of changes you're going to make to the portfolio based on conversations you were having with customers. Do you -- where do you feel like they are in terms of knowing what their kind of network architectures are looking like when they come back or just how their budgets are looking for the remainder of the year? Chuck, when you talk about the portfolio and the changes you need to make over there and the acceleration of R&D in some areas, can you talk about more specifically what areas you feel you need the most adjustment in? And also, it feels like the pace of technology evolution, it clearly is -- just keeps accelerating. There's so much of it you can do internally. And you've been very acquisitive in the past, but I can't help but feel like you need to move much faster and much more aggressive on M&A. And I know you've been very disciplined from a price standpoint. And clearly, a market like we have today is not necessarily conducive to that. But just given the fact that we're moving much, much faster, are you more open to get a bit more aggressive here on the M&A front to fill in gaps? Because it sounds like -- it feels like the longer you wait on this, the gaps will keep getting bigger, not smaller. Kelly, you'll be significantly missed, so thank you for the duration. But looking forward, if my model is right, and maybe it's wrong, it seems like year-over-year revenue comparisons get materially easily -- easier, maybe to the tune of 400 basis points year-over-year for the quarter outlook. And like with Huawei being pushed out and Cisco being preferred in many countries, even beyond the United States as well as an incumbency factor coming out of coronavirus, help me bridge your kind of year-over-year revenue growth. And maybe it's still yet to come about why things aren't more positive because the comps are easier. Huawei is less preferred than Cisco. Cisco has an incumbency factor, and we're coming out of coronavirus. Kelly, thank you so much for your service. Maybe sort of a question, 2 clarifications. Chuck, your response to Jim's question, when you talk about feeling pretty much the same as 90 days ago in the U.S., you're referring to both enterprise and commercial, your small, medium customers as well as your large customers across the board? And then with respect to the $1 billion that you referenced in terms of coming out of costs, will that all be out of OpEx? And I appreciate there's probably some sensitivity if it involves headcount reduction, as I suspect it does. But Kelly, I'm hoping you could give us a sense for the timing in that reduction and the nature of the reductions. Is that all in OpEx? Or is some of it out of cost of goods sold? Kelly, you'll be missed. I guess I wanted to go back to the linearity of this order trajectory, Chuck and Kelly, on particularly enterprise. I guess if we go back to 2009, we're starting to see commercial order volumes deteriorating into the range we saw back then in that recession. We haven't really seen enterprise do that. And I wonder whether you think that, that is where we're kind of headed here. It just feels like this is not turning out to be a V-shape recovery. It's more like a -- we're headed into a real recession, prolonged recession. So I'm just curious kind of what you think about the trajectory of those volumes, what they look like at the end of the quarter versus the beginning of the quarter. Okay. Can I have a follow-up? Yes. I just wondered if you guys could talk a little bit about the -- kind of what sort of color you're hearing from the enterprise customers. Do you think that they've -- because they're investing so aggressively in work from home, are they pulling demand forward out of the back end of the year? Like are their budgets changing? Are they just kind of robbing from the back end-of-the-year budgets and moving it toward the front end of the year to compensate for work from home and all that stuff that's going on? Great. Kelly, we will miss you. So -- and you're too young to retire. I wanted to follow up, Chuck, on the Cat 9K because you did mention the strength there. And I guess I'm trying to discern sort of the macro versus the product cycle issues. And my understanding is that the portfolio has been releasing platforms that are more suited for smaller enterprises just at the time when those are the weakest customers. So if you could help us maybe understand the overall contributions of this product and where you are in the product cycle and maybe even explain what's macro-related versus normal cycle-related. Congrats on the retirement there, Kelly. For me, I kind of want to bridge a few of the questions that have been asked together. But Chuck, you talked about accelerating the transition towards SaaS. Can you guys give us an update as to where that SaaS revenue is, not the term license contribution, and where you guys think it could accelerate given the investments? And then utilizing Ittai's question from before, do you need to acquire to help accelerate it? Understood. Appreciate the color. And congrats again, Kelly. My congratulations again, Kelly. We look forward to seeing you in a new role at some point down the road. I have a question and a clarification. I think the question, Chuck, last quarter, you spent a little bit of time talking with us about traction on the web scale side of things. I'm wondering if that traction has seen some follow-through, if you could update us on that. And then secondly, for Kelly, when you suggest that the OpEx will come lower by $800 million, is that a gross number? Or is that a net number, i.e. you'll take it out by $800 million but bring some back in some of the growth areas in this business? I guess I wanted to kind of go back to the discussion of moving more of the business to a as-a-service model. And could you just put a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of what areas are you specifically thinking about as new candidates to kind of move that direction? And how do you incentivize customers in those areas also? I'm just trying to think about the mechanics of how this works. And then congrats to Kelly also.

CSCO,Q2 2020,2000,3723,1717,"Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Thanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we told you last quarter and still see now, the feedback from our customers is that they remain strongly committed to both our products and services. However, like many in our industry, we are seeing longer decision-making cycles across our customer segments for a variety of reasons, including macro uncertainty as well as unique geographical issues. The good news is, once this uncertainty passes for our customers, we expect to see spending recover as technology continues to be at the heart of all they do. You'll see in our numbers this quarter that we continue to make progress on several key metrics, including our shift to more software and subscriptions, with 72% of our software now being sold as a subscription. While we still have a lot more work to do, I firmly believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. The long-term secular growth trends of 5G, WiFi 6, 400 gig and the shift to the cloud remain, and we expect to benefit from them. This is a multiyear transformation, and we are managing our business well while staying focused on helping our customers build simpler, more secure and cost-effective networks. The broad adoption of multi-cloud and modern application environments is changing how the world's largest networks are built, operated and secured, and Cisco is at the center of this transition. We have made significant investments in the development of software, silicon and optics, the building blocks for the Internet of the future. We believe this strategy will change the economics of how the Internet will be built to support 5G, 400 gig and the demands of the future while helping our customers innovate and move faster than ever before. In December, we introduced Cisco Silicon One, a first-ever single, unified silicon architecture; and the Cisco 8000 carrier-class router family built on Silicon One; as well as our new IOS XR7 operating system. We also announced new flexible purchasing options that enable customers to consume our technology, however they choose. We also collaborated closely with several of the largest web-scale and SP companies throughout the development process. Their participation in our launch demonstrates their strong support of our strategy as well as our commitment to continued innovation. Our goal is to accelerate the deployment of next-generation Internet infrastructure by offering our customers choices of components, white box or integrated systems in a flexible consumption model. Now let me share a brief update on our businesses, starting with Infrastructure Platforms. As the global leader in networking, we believe we are well positioned with our intent-based networking portfolio given the strategic investments we've been making. Over the past several quarters, we've made tremendous progress integrating automation, analytics and security across our enterprise networking portfolio, while at the same time, shifting to a subscription-based model. A great example of our success is the ongoing strong adoption of our Catalyst 9000 platforms. We continue to extend our secure SD-WAN solutions as customers move more applications to the cloud. To do this, we are actively engaging with web-scale companies to help our customers extend their wide-area networks to the cloud and secure their business applications. Recently, we announced integration with Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN and Office 365, along with a deeper partnership with Amazon Web Services, to deliver highly secure end-to-end connectivity and better application performance. Now to Security. We had another solid quarter with strength across our advanced threat and cloud-based solutions, including Duo and Umbrella, which are important growth drivers of our business. We continue to see significant opportunity as we execute on our strategy to deliver an integrated security platform. As the market moves to a multi-cloud environment and the need for visibility grows, we're benefiting from our strong position as our customers' most trusted partner. Our differentiated end-to-end approach across the network, cloud and endpoint is winning customers with 100% of the Fortune 100 now using one or more of Cisco security solutions. This quarter, we expanded our security portfolio from the cloud to the edge. We brought to market an integrated IoT architecture, providing enhanced visibility, insights and threat detection across our customers' entire environment. This architecture includes our new software-based security solutions, Cyber Vision; and our Edge Intelligence data collection tool to enable our customers to make better business decisions. Finally, Applications. There is no question that customers are undergoing a significant workplace transformation, and they are turning to Cisco to help them with this transition. As a global market leader, we believe we are the only company providing a cognitive, highly secure and analytics-driven collaboration platform, which is the foundation for their workplace transformation. This platform is becoming increasingly critical to how enterprises empower their teams by allowing their employees to work more effectively together. To extend our value proposition, we continue to make strategic investments. For example, we recently brought to market several key WebEx capabilities, which combine context, AI and machine learning to enable our customers and their teams to further enhance their meeting experiences. We achieved another strong quarter of growth with AppDynamics, demonstrating our ability to deliver unique real-time, AI-powered insights from a single pane of glass, providing complete visibility. Our customers are looking to connect application performance monitoring with infrastructure automation to simplify IT and increase productivity. 2 weeks ago, we announced we are bringing together AppDynamics and our Intersight Workload Optimizer to deliver comprehensive visibility of applications and infrastructure, both on-prem and in the cloud, using machine learning and AI to proactively remediate problems and optimize user experiences. To summarize, I am pleased with our business transformation and with the new innovative platforms we're bringing to market. While we continue to experience some pause in customer spending related to the uncertainty in the global macro environment, our long-term growth opportunities remain unchanged. Going forward, we will continue to focus on developing groundbreaking technologies and building a new Internet for the 5G era that will help our customers innovate faster than ever before. I remain incredibly confident that our execution against our strategy will drive profitable growth and generate strong shareholder returns for the long term. I will now turn it over to Kelly. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3. Our overall Q2 results were consistent with our expectations. We executed well with strong margins and EPS growth. Total revenue was down $12 billion -- was at $12 billion, down 4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.7%, up 1.6 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.3 billion, flat year-over-year; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 5%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was down 6% to $8.7 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 8%. Switching revenue declined in both Campus and Data Center. We did see growth with the continued ramp of our Cat 9K and strength of the Nexus 9K. Routing declined driven by weakness in service provider. Wireless declined overall, but we did see strong growth in Meraki and are starting to see the ramp of our WiFi 6 products. Data Center revenue declined driven by servers, offset by strong growth in HyperFlex. Applications was down 8% driven by a decline in Unified Communications, partially offset by double-digit growth in AppDynamics. Security was 9% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management. Service revenue was up 5% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 72% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-over-year. In terms of orders in Q2, total product orders were down 6%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 8%, EMEA was down 1% and APJC was down 4%. Total emerging markets were down 7%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 20%. In our customer segments, public sector was flat, while enterprise was down 7%. Commercial was down 4%, and service provider was down 11%. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q2 were $24.9 billion, up 11%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 66.4%, up 2.3 points. Product gross margin was 65.9%, up 3.1 points; and service gross margin was 67.7%, flat year-over-year. In terms of the bottom line, from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was $2.9 billion, and EPS was $0.68. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $27.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, flat year-over-year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.9 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today, we announced a $0.01 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share, up 3% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 2.9% based on today's closing price. This dividend increase reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. In early Q3, we closed our acquisition of Exablaze, a designer and manufacturer of advanced network devices aimed at reducing latency and improving network performance. To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and EPS growth. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 1.5% to minus 3.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.79 to $0.81. Our guidance does not reflect any potential disruptions in our global supply chain that could result from the coronavirus. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and open the line for questions.","Yes. Tim, thanks. It's a great question. So I think, first of all, there are many secular growth drivers that are lined up, the 5G transition, the 400-gig transition, WiFi 6, the shift to cloud. And what we're seeing from customers is really just -- it's just pausing, just trying to see what's going on. Now what I'll say is that, clearly, late in the quarter, if you look at some of the issues that had been outstanding that were creating some of the uncertainty, like Brexit, we got closer to resolution. We obviously got a signature late in the quarter on a first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal, and USMCA has now gone through in the U.S. So hopefully, those will give our customers a little more viability. When I speak to the customers, they're still fully planning on moving forward. They're just a little cautious and trying to see what's going on. We obviously have the virus now that we'll see how it plays out. But overall, I don't think it's deep. And we expect that, given some of this uncertainty has now dissipated, notwithstanding what we see, obviously, from the virus, that hopefully we'll see our customers pick up again. Thanks, Tim. That's a very good question. Thank you. I -- we have done a lot of work on the transformation of being able to support the software model and the subscription software model, in particular, with the automation. And we have -- if you go back to 2017, when we first launched the Catalyst 9000 and we announced subscription businesses on our enterprise networking portfolio, the second half of this year will have some -- a number of -- a small amount of the early renewals on that. So our team has been working hard to be prepared for those renewals. And then in fiscal '21, we'll see a material number, a reasonably material number associated with that. So I think the sales organization, we've run pilots, and now we've scaled things. We're running other pilots, and we're scaling things. And we've got the customer experience organization that Maria Martina is leading that has been building out their capabilities. So we have more to do, but I feel good about the progress we've made, and I think that we're in a pretty good position right now. Simon, it's a lot better just to wave hands. Now let me tell you a little bit. I don't think that it's a market that we are ignoring or we -- in fact, if you look at the announcements we made in December, let me give you a little update on that. We have about 5 years of R&D effort in what we announced in December. So that's a lot of commitment to the market. So we do believe that there will be a resurgence. I think that -- I will talk about 5G and 400 gig as well. But just to give you an update on -- in December, as you know, we launched Silicon One, which is at the heart of these new systems called Cisco 8000 that we launched. And we also announced that we would be willing to sell our Silicon to go into a white box or sell it just directly to a customer, if that's how they like to procure it. I will tell you that across the cloud titans there, we're engaged with all of them on variations of those architectures. Several of them were with us at the announcement in December, which shows you their belief in what we're doing. We have taken orders for both from different cloud players, and so we feel good about the acceptance of that launch. The 8000 series will be a fundamental backbone product for 5G networks, and I will tell you that we have early wins on IP infrastructure to support 5G rollouts in over 30 customers around the world. They're early. Some of those are cell site aggregation, backhaul, some core wins. Most of them are in non-stand-alone, which means they're enhancing their current networks, and then they'll look to build stand-alone networks. As we've said, we believe that will start in 2021 where we could begin to see some of that pickup. So we think the 400-gig transition as well as the 5G build-out will be the drivers that we'd be looking for over the next couple of years. Thanks, Chuck. Yes, sure. Happy to. And I know we're really happy about where the -- both gross margins and op margins are. But as you know, Paul, it's driven by a few things. This software transformation has been benefiting us through both -- you can see it in the mix of our products when we show you the gross margin walks in our Qs as well as just overall, so we're benefiting from that. I'd say the second big driver is price. We've been very, very disciplined on price, meaning we're taking advantage of raising prices where we have elasticity, for example, on really older products that we want to shift to newer products or where we know we have room to move, we've been doing that, I think, very effectively. We've been managing the decline in the pricing and the server market fairly well, balancing that with the DRAM prices that are going down dramatically. So what you're going to see in the reporting this quarter, Paul, and I know you always ask, you'll see our pricing. I mentioned in the last quarter's call that pricing was at an all-time lowest level of impact, meaning the most beneficial it's been. We're right back at 1.1 points on our year-over-year gross margin walk, so it's still very, very good for us and more in line of what it was, I'd say, a couple of quarters before Q1. So that's going well. DRAM is benefiting us this quarter for sure. And as you know, that's becoming less and less of a benefit to us now as we're starting to see the DRAM prices tick back up. But we've, again, managed that pricing and DRAM cost equation very well. So just in general, I think you can expect a little bit more pressure from DRAM pricing, the year-over-year compares getting less, which is why I guided what I guided. But overall, you're still going to see the goodness coming through from the continued increase of our business being software driven. Yes. I mean, again, I would say yes because what we're doing on the portfolio is more and more software content. So by definition, it will be good for us. We will always have the potential for large swings for things like component costs like DRAM, plus or minus. But as always, we'll let you know when those are happening. But yes, I mean, if you go back and look 3 years back from where we were there to where we are now, it is long term, just the shift of the overall portfolio that we've been driving. Yes. Jim, good question, and let me take a crack at it. So when I look at the segment, it's -- if I focus on enterprise, a lot of it is the Q2 '19 really, really strong product cycle ramps we had. So if I go back to Q2 '19, it was a record for the Campus switching for -- as well as for Collaboration back in Q2 '19. No excuse, but that's what that was. I would say beyond that, if I would isolate overall kind of our regions from a bookings point of view, the Americas was down 8%. And if I look at that, the U.S. itself was slightly better but in that range, and I'd say it was driven by 2 areas. It was driven by the routing portfolio, largely SP segment. That was the biggest driver. And the second biggest driver was the decline we're seeing in the server market. And again, that's directly related to the decline of DRAM prices flowing through the entire market, and we saw that last quarter as well. So that drove the Americas. Europe was at minus 1%, basically flat. But that -- the biggest driver when I look at Europe was really the U.K. We are seeing a slowdown because of Brexit, and we did see it in the public sector significantly, which is always a big growth driver for the U.K. for us. So U.K., both enterprise and public sector slowed down for us, which drove Europe. Europe would have been up 2 points without the U.K. And then for APJC, it continues to be the rapid decline of China. China, as I've talked about, and the BRICS plus Mexico being down. China was down again over 30%. It's still only about 2% of our total business, but it still hurts the overall. I mean Asia Pac, excluding China, would have been up a couple of points as well, 3 points. So from a geography, those are the key drivers. And again, to your point, we are going off against some tough compares in enterprise for both the Catalyst 9K ramp a year ago, and Collab just had a record quarter. Thanks, Jim. Yes. I think the -- first of all, they have re-architected all those platforms, integrated the back ends and have a very modern set of solutions to take to market. And we're currently working -- I was talking to the team yesterday. I think there's 11 workshops with major customers in the next 30 days to work on plans to get them to the modern portfolio because some customers have been running variations of the stuff that we've had out there for 10 to 15 years, so we're in good shape. In fact, there was a great analyst report that was written just a couple of days ago about -- industry analyst about the portfolio and how far it's come and how effective it is right now. So I feel good about what they're doing. I think if you look back a year ago, flat out -- Collab was up 24%. I mean -- and it's a huge business to be up that much. So they had a very tough year to compare against, but I'm pleased with where they are. There is competition. Obviously, there's some good competition in the space which frankly should just keep making us better. But the team is doing, I think, a really good job. Kelly, do you want to comment on... Yes. I mean I'll just give you the -- I'd say the largest driver was the UC business and the revenue being down, the huge majority, followed by a bit on the endpoints on the TP. And conferencing was down marginally, hardly anything. So the biggest driver was, for sure, the -- on the Unified Communications side. Yes. I would say -- I've talked about this. On the service increase, it has -- there's been no change on the accounting side for how we account for software. Service improvement, we've been really driving that. Maria Martinez, the lead CX for customer experience, has been really focused on driving renewal rates and adoption. And you've seen our services business from a revenue perspective tick up over the last 4 quarters. So I'd say that 5% growth you saw in services is just continued performance by that team to do that. I'd say on the infrastructure platform side, it does go back to, again, just very, very -- we were peak -- not peak, but we were very, very high, ramping of Campus switching last year that -- so that's a tougher compare. I mean it's still growing like crazy, but that's a big driver. Routing is still down, driven by the SP segment. And then in terms of the last piece from a year, again, we talk about, and you saw that Applications was up 24%, again, which was all Collab basically a year ago as well. So it's nothing more than those things, I would say. Combined with just the data center server market is -- we're starting to feel that you can see what's happening in the market there. Well, we certainly -- we're certainly trying to make that a sustainable kind of range. We have no desire to have that slow down. But again, it's -- the team is doing everything they can. They're offering new solutions, not just -- they're trying to find more ways to drive incremental growth versus just being tied to the maintenance, to the product orders. And they're driving much more solutions along software and everything else, so they're working a lot of plays in the services area. Thank you. You want to go first? Yes. I can go first. Yes. Your question is a good question, Rod, but I would say, really the -- where we ended up at the minus 6% was not a surprise. That's kind of when I gave guidance for the Q2, kind of what the expectation was. I would say, as you know, when we roll up the guide as we go for Q3, we just -- it's the same process, and we know exactly what's coming off the balance sheet. We have -- we know exactly what's in backlog. We know exactly what we expect for orders coming in, and it's just pure math. I think, again, back to a lot of the decline in the order rate was there's a bit of compares. But the rest, when you do the math and add it all up to what you expect to come through for the next quarter, it gives you the number I guided, the midpoint. If you look at that, it's very consistent with what our normal Q3 to Q2 sequentials are. And, Rod, on the question around the 5G discussions in Washington, I mean, obviously, they're very interested in having U.S. companies participating in 5G and frankly lead in 5G. And so we have spent a lot of time educating different folks in Washington about what technologies actually constitute an entire 5G network. So you rightly said not the stuff we have, but the radio, which is pretty much what we don't have. But I think that -- I think the U.S. is in really good shape. I think we have packet core. We've got cell site and radio backhaul. We got the IP routing core. We got security, and we have -- obviously, there's a couple of companies in Europe, one in South Korea that provide the radio technology. There's also software players that are out there right now that are building disaggregated open RAN solutions that can be used in the future. And so we're spending a lot of time helping them understand that and working to just make sure that there's a recognition that there's a lot of technology that's been built and being built here in the United States that is leading in these 5G infrastructures. And I actually think the U.S. is in fine shape. I think, both from a carrier deployment perspective, I think we're in great shape, and I think we're in good position with the technology. I don't think the U.S. government should make investments in these companies, but we are certainly working with lots of industry peers, again, on both education and then trying to just make sure that the U.S. does have solutions with combining these European players with a lot of our technologies to make sure that everyone's comfortable with those solutions. Thanks, Chuck. That's a tough question to answer. We've been dealing with challenges in this segment for a long time. I think the -- history would tell you that when we see consolidation, it creates a slowing. I'm not sure that this particular one represents that because I think they are going to be in investment mode and is triggering investment with other players as well. And I think the 5G build-out that all of them are working on will probably fuel investment. I think, for us, it just depends on how quickly they do that and how soon they decide to build a stand-alone 5G network for enterprises. I think most of them are looking at their consumer networks and believing they can accommodate them on their existing backbones with perhaps some minor upgrades, but I think that will determine it. So I think it's more connected to how fast they move on that than it has to do with any of the consolidation or no consolidation right now. Yes. I'll just say the growth rate of the Cat 9K is unbelievable still. I mean it is a very high double-digit number. I would say there's no -- we haven't heard issues. I'd say for maybe some of the smaller DCEs, there's a question about the subscription, but we've managed through that. But I would say those -- the new products from the 9200 through the 9600 that isn't slowing, and the growth rates are very, very strong. Obviously, the legacy products that they have replaced are falling off, as you would expect. But we have not seen any slow on the transition. It's the fast -- and again, we mentioned this in the early ramp of the Cat 9K. But at this point, the percentage of what the Cat 9K as of total Campus switching is the fastest ramp of any transition we've done. And if you look at the -- what Kelly talked about earlier with WiFi 6 beginning to ramp, that's a subscription model. Our Meraki business is a subscription model which is still growing very well. So I don't think the subscription model has anything to do with it. I just think in certain cases, some of our larger customers who are watching some of the things going on just decided to just take a pause and take a look at what's happening, and then I think they'll kick back in. So Tal, it's great question. I think in the routing space simply it's the 5G backbone build-out that we've been talking about for a few years. Once that starts, I think -- given the percentage of our routing business that is attributed to service providers, I think that's the key as well as us winning these Cisco 8000 insertions that we have proof of concepts going on today with many of the large customers, both service provider and web-scale players. So I think that's that one. And I think on the Campus side, I just think that's a -- that's just a timing issue. I think that the growth we're seeing in the Catalyst 9000 is tremendous. And I think that customers that began to build out their refresh, given where we are as a percentage of the installed base that we have replaced, it's got a long road ahead of it. I think that the only reason that we saw a little slowdown is just because customers just decided to pause the deployments a bit. But I think that, that will come back when this uncertainty and the capital spending frees up. Routing, I answered first with the SP, with the 5G backbone stuff because of how big a percentage service provider represents in our routing portfolio. Thanks, Tal. Yes. I mean, again, I think back a few years ago before we adopted the new revenue standards, it was a bigger impact. It was up to like 250 or 300 basis points with ASC 606. It's come back down to that 100 basis points. But at this point, we don't even talk about it that way because we've been ramping so quickly the entire portfolio to that. But at max, it would be, I'd say, 100 bps or so. Yes. So I'll give you the sort of the qualitative answer, and Kelly can give you something on the data. But I think the secure SD-WAN is the solution that our customers are looking for. I mean they want the integration with their cloud gateways from their branches, and so it is a key differentiator for us. Our teams are working hard on continuing to build that out. And I think over the next couple of years, it will continue to -- it will be even more of a differentiator as we continue to get more and more integration between those 2 portfolios. Kelly? Yes. No. I'd say that's absolutely right. And in terms of how important Umbrella and Duo are, they absolutely are the key growth drivers for us, the whole cloud security space for us and will continue to be so. And I'd say we recently launched our Security in a great way, which is just starting, and that will be all part of our cloud security portfolio as well, and we expect that to be a huge growth driver as well. All right. Well, let me just thank everyone for joining us today, and I'll just recap by saying that while we have seen a bit of a pause, we actually feel really good. The conversations I have with our customers, I mean, all of the things they're trying to do, I believe, our technology is at the heart of. Whether it's rebuilding their applications, whether securing their data, transforming their infrastructure in this new era or changing their user experience as well as the way they interface with their customers, I think that we're in a very good position to help them do that, and we feel good about where we are. So thank you all for joining us today, and we'll look forward to catching up with you next quarter. Thanks, Chuck. Just to wrap the call, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2020 third quarter results, will be on Wednesday, May 13, 2020, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If there are any further questions, feel free to contact Cisco's Investor Relations group, and we thank you very much for joining today's call.","Yes. Chuck, maybe if I could just start talking about the macro and the kind of the longer decision process. In your sense, how long do you think this would last, particularly if you maybe put into the context that you mentioned a lot of industry drivers going on in 400 gig and WiFi 6? And obviously, you got some new router and  silicon products out. So maybe just talk a little bit about the timing of that recovery and how you think you can maybe outperform it given all the different dynamics you have going across the businesses this year. I had a big-picture question. With the December routing announcements and the Cat 9K before that, a lot of the Cisco strategy is now around selling incremental automation software to lower customer OpEx. That seems to require a significant change in your organization. So how far along are you in the sales and channel transformation to fit that goal? I'm wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the service provider vertical given it's been a long-running challenge and seems as if, maybe to some extent, it's less of a focus for Cisco given that it's such -- become a smaller part of the business. But I want to see if you can maybe talk about how you see this market eventually recovering, kind of the timing and the drivers, maybe double-clicking beyond just sort of the 5G hand-waving, if we could get a better understanding of what will drive it and when. Sorry, I'm still -- don't know how to use the cellphone. Kelly, your margin structure was particularly strong this quarter, and that represents a long-standing trend, both near term and longer term. I recognize the guidance represents an easing. I assume some of that is due to the backup in DRAM pricing or the pending backup. Can you go back through the drivers and what you expect over the next year or 2 both at gross and the operating level? Kelly, if I could just quickly follow up. Looking beyond the quarter, looking beyond April, given the ongoing shift to software, is there any reason why margins should continue to head up, putting aside quarterly volatility? Thank you very much for the clarity so far. And I had one question that's kind of more broad. I don't know if it's -- for which of you. But on product orders, I was just kind of looking and thinking about the product orders. It looks like the enterprise product orders got incrementally a little more challenged. Public sector got a little more challenged. Service provider marginally improved compared to last quarter year-over-year. So can you maybe just give us some color on product orders? It looks like maybe enterprise, a little difficult year-over-year comps. Was it last year, a big product cycle in enterprise? Or why are we actually seeing enterprise kind of decline incrementally a little bit worse? Chuck, I wanted to dig into Applications, down 8% on a year-over-year basis. And I understand the pressure on the Unified Communications business, and it's good to see APPD is still growing. But you haven't talked WebEx. Am I to assume that WebEx is not growing, stuck in the middle here? Help me think about the transformation Amy has been doing over there, where we are in that transformation and how should I think about the growth and competitiveness of that platform going forward? Yes. I was hoping that you could unpack sort of -- a bit of a bigger downtick maybe in IP than we were expecting a balanced by -- or better performance on the services line. Can you sort of help us understand what the dynamics are and some of that maybe accounting for where the software goes? I'd love to understand that a little bit better, please. Does that imply, Kelly, that, that 5% services growth rate is a durable number? Or should we be thinking it will fluctuate between that and the sort of low single-digit growth that we've seen? Obviously, they are. Congratulations. Yes. I just had a quick question, trying to juxtapose the guidance with the order rates. If you look at the total product orders, the rate, they're down 6%; after, down 4%. So that deteriorated. And yes, your revenue guidance for the midpoint at least, your revenue decline is a little better than the quarter you just printed. So you printed down 3.5%; and the guide, down 2.5%. So kind of tailing on Jeff's question there, is the services making that up? And what should we be expecting for product revenue in the guided quarter? And then I also -- I'm hoping, Chuck, maybe you'll make a comment on this whole 5G investment commentary coming out of the press and maybe the government. What do you think about -- how interested is Cisco in potentially helping deploy U.S. wireless infrastructure, not the stuff you do today, but actual base stations and things like that? Could you just comment on how you see some of those -- that commentary, how you think that might develop? I would like to ask about the SP orders that were down 11% in the quarter. And looking forward to the back half of this year and any kind of forward-looking indicator trajectory commentary would be helpful. If we look at 2 scenarios, one scenario assuming a recent telecom consolidation, right, that we've all heard about in the last 2 days; and then the scenario where no consolidation actually happens for the rest of the year, should we expect service provider orders to inflect positively in one of those scenarios or in both of those scenarios as we look at the back half and maybe kind of mid- to back half of 2020? I just wanted to see if we can drill down a bit more on the Cat 9k product portfolio. You mentioned already a couple of times on the call that the product -- the revenue momentum there is quite strong. I was just wondering if you can kind of talk about the impact on the growth rate that you've kind of seen directionally through this kind of broader landscape of slowing enterprise spending and if the growth rate there is kind of still substantially different from what you're seeing for the rest of the portfolio. Is it -- do you think it's more a reflection of the subscription kind of model that you're going with on that portfolio or more kind of the refresh that's driving that difference and kind of what you're seeing related to the rest of the portfolio? Yes. I want to ask you a broader question, and I will call it secular versus cyclical. Switching had a small cycle, short cycle with a new switch. There was growth acceleration. Now we see a decline overall in switching, and there's probably substitution between new and old. And routing is also declining. And the question I'm asking is, of the trends you see today, data center switching, Campus switching, routing, service providers, what is cyclical and what is secular, meaning when are we going to see a reversal -- or not when in terms of timing. What's going to drive, I should say -- what's going to drive a reversal of the trends in routing? What could drive  a reversal in data centers and campuses? What are the things that could drive at least a cyclical growth from here or even secular growth kind of longer term? And routing? Great. With subscriptions being 72% of software revenue, which you stated, I wondered if you kind of had an update as to how much of a headwind that kind of business model transition is. In the past, you kind of said a couple of hundred basis points. But just any -- directionally if that's still about right would be helpful. One part that we haven't talked about here today is on the security side. We have RSA coming up at the end of the month. So just wondering if we could double-click on where we are with Duo and Umbrella together as it seems like they're the biggest drivers of the business? Can you guys talk a little bit more about the contribution of these 2 specifically to the portfolio and how Umbrella specifically is impacting your adoption of secure SD-WAN versus some of the other vendors that are out there?

CSCO,Q3 2020,2831,4347,1577,"Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including those related to COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during this quarter -- or during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Chuck, I'll now turn it over to you. Thanks, Marilyn. Before we get started, I want to express my gratitude and appreciation for all the frontline workers, who are fighting this pandemic every day to keep so many safe. I also want to express my sympathies for those who have lost their lives and the families that have endured the deepest pains from the impact of this tragic situation we are in today. This truly is unlike anything any of us have ever experienced. As you can imagine, we have been focused on helping our employees, customers, partners and communities. We currently have 95% of our global workforce working from home, which was a seamless transition for us as we already had a flexible work policy. And we build the technologies that allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive. For those 5% who must be in the office to do their roles, we are clearly focused on their health and safety and are taking all of the necessary precautions. During the crisis, many of our customers and partners have been under enormous pressure as they face cash flow challenges. This is why we introduced a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as they dramatically shifted entire workforces to be remote. In addition, we announced $2.5 billion in financing with a new Business Resiliency Program through Cisco Capital to offer financial flexibility and support their business continuity. This will help customers and partners access the technology they need now, invest for recovery and defer most of the payments until early 2021. This pandemic is highlighting so many inequities that already existed and is exacerbating these problems. I'm proud to say that Cisco has committed nearly $300 million to date to support both global and local pandemic response efforts, including providing technology and financial support for nonprofits, first responders and governments. We are also donating personal protective equipment to hospital workers, including N95 masks and face shields 3D-printed by Cisco volunteers around the world. I'm so proud of our teams who have been relentlessly focused on these efforts and continuing to identify how we can be innovative to help those most in need. I'd particularly like to call out our IT, Webex, Security and supply chain teams, along with our partners and suppliers, who have been working around the clock to ensure we are doing all that we can to keep organizations around the world up and running and giving back to our communities. Thank you. Now turning to our third quarter performance. Despite the challenging environment we are all operating in, we delivered a solid quarter and financial performance in the midst of the greatest financial crisis of our lifetime. While we are not immune to the impacts of the global pandemic, we believe our underlying business fundamentals and financial position remains strong. As we look at the quarter, it very much reflected the journey of the pandemic. In March, we were performing ahead of our expectations as companies focused on building resiliency in their IT environments. Then in April, we began to see a slowdown across the business as countries across the world were locked down. While parts of our portfolio have been more impacted than others, we believe our leadership from a product, innovation and operational perspective remains solid. While there's so much uncertainty now, we believe our role has never been more important. And our responsibility has never been greater as much of the world is running on Cisco's technology from networking to collaboration to security to stay connected, secure and productive. Organizations more than ever must focus on resiliency and agility, and those who had invested in digital capabilities were able to make this shift more seamlessly. While we cannot predict when it's going to happen, one thing we believe is that the demand for our products and services will be strong when we emerge from this situation. We believe the transition in our own business model through our shift to more software- and subscription-based offerings is paying off. We saw continued strong adoption of our SaaS-based offerings and now have 74% of our software that is subscription versus 65% a year ago. We also believe we remain well positioned over the long term to serve our customers and create differentiated value aligned to cloud, 5G, WiFi 6 and 400 gig. Our business model, diversified portfolio and ability to continue to invest in key growth priorities gives us a strong foundation to build even stronger customer relationships. As we prepare for the future, we will closely partner with our customers to modernize their infrastructure, secure their remote workforce and their data through our innovative solutions that will serve as the foundation for their digital organizations. Next, I'll turn to the performance of our business segments, starting with Infrastructure Platforms. With the world going online practically overnight, the demand on networks has never been greater with users looking for secure connectivity, reliable performance and consistent experiences. This has led to our customers evaluating how to expand their capacity quickly, how best to protect their teams and how to keep their data secure while keeping their business productive. It is also requiring enterprise IT to rapidly set up, deploy and provision mobile offices or mobile health care clinics. What I've seen IT teams do around the world and what they've made possible is simply astonishing. Our strategy and value proposition are clear. We are powering the world's ability to stay connected, productive and secure while automating many of these capabilities. Our intent-based networking architecture was built for environments like this. For industries like health care, public services, financial services and service providers especially, having network infrastructure tightly integrated with security is mission-critical. In Q3, we offered new cloud-based COVID-19 bundles for teleworker, mobile health care and pop-up branch use cases through our partners and service providers. As customers modernize their network infrastructure, we saw continued strong customer adoption of our subscription-based Catalyst 9000 as customers look to quickly scale remote access capabilities to keep their employees safe and their businesses running. We continue to execute on our secure cloud scale SD-WAN strategy by investing in innovation and partnerships to help enterprises accelerate their multi-cloud strategies. As an example, we are now integrating with our Umbrella secure Internet gateway to give our customers flexibility to use best-of-breed cloud security with our industry-leading SD-WAN solution. Our partnerships across web scale providers like AWS, Azure and our most recent announcement with Google Cloud allow us to offer a truly multi-cloud network fabric. As bandwidth and SaaS application demand increases, we are enabling our customers to securely connect branches and interconnect to different cloud providers to enable consistent application performance and user experience. Moving on to Security, which is always at the heart of everything we do. In Q3, we saw solid growth, reflecting increased demand for our robust solutions to secure the rapid growth in remote workers and their devices. Being the largest enterprise security company in the world, we are uniquely positioned to safeguard our customers wherever they work. We have the most comprehensive and integrated end-to-end portfolio in the industry across the network, cloud, applications and end points. As I mentioned earlier, we provided extended free licenses for key security technologies that are designed to protect remote workers, including Cisco Umbrella, Zero Trust Security from Duo, industry-leading secure network access from Cisco AnyConnect and end point protection from our AMP technology. We're also supporting our customers on their multi-cloud journey by enabling them to secure direct Internet access, cloud application usage and roaming users. We are only 2 quarters into our secure Internet gateway transition, and we are already seeing strong adoption from existing and new customers. Building on the investments we made in innovation, partnerships and acquisitions, we also introduced SecureX. This is the industry's broadest cloud-based security platform, connecting the breadth of our portfolio and our customer security infrastructure by providing unified visibility, automation and simplified security across applications, network end points and the cloud. Turning to Applications. Teleworking and collaboration tools have become a lifeline for businesses and their people to stay connected and productive with security and privacy being more critical than ever. Our portfolio is at the center of our customer strategy for empowering teams and increasing productivity as 95% of the Fortune 500 use our collaboration portfolio today. We take a security-first approach to remote working and provide highly secure cloud-based collaboration solutions with integrated end-to-end encryption while protecting our customers' privacy. Throughout the quarter, we invested in scaling our platform at an unparalleled speed to deliver a highly secure, consistent experience and ensuring business continuity for our customers. We are now running our Webex platform at 3x the capacity we were running at in February to manage the dramatic increase in usage growth. We had well over 500 million meeting participants, generating 25 billion meeting minutes in April, more than triple the volume in February. We also added many new prospects through free WebEx trials that we anticipate converting to revenue in the future. With applications at the core of every business and the surge in demand for monitoring tools that provide real-time business insights and optimize user experiences in multi-cloud environments, AppDynamics continues to perform well, particularly in this environment. As I wrap up, I just want to reiterate how grateful I am to have our teams, our resources and our operational resiliency during this time. I also want to commend the heroic efforts of IT organizations and teams around the world, who have had to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at an unprecedented speed and scale. This crisis has highlighted the importance of having highly resilient, globally scalable infrastructure technologies to keep the world running, and this is what we build. We are providing innovative solutions that help our customers support business continuity, drive productivity and ensure a highly secure work environment. We believe we will emerge from this crisis stronger than before. With our accelerated innovation cycle, refreshed portfolio and significant progress on our shift to more software and subscriptions, we are in a better position today than in past times of uncertainty. Our confidence is further supported by our strong balance sheet to invest for the future and our proven ability to execute no matter the environment. I also believe our incredible culture has been amplified during this time. And I'm so proud of what our teams have achieved. I am confident Cisco is resilient, and we are built to last regardless of what the future brings. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you. Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by guidance for Q4. Our overall Q3 results reflect good execution with strong margins and non-GAAP EPS growth in a very challenging environment. COVID-19 did have an impact on our financial results and business operations this quarter, especially in our supply chain, where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints. Total revenue was $12 billion, down 8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 34.9%, up 2.7 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.79, up 1%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was down 12% to $8.6 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 15%. This is the area that was most impacted by the supply chain challenges. Switching revenue declined in both campus and in data center. We did see strong growth with the continued ramp of the Cat 9K. Routing declined in both service provider and in enterprise. Data center revenue declined driven by continued market contraction impacting both our servers and HyperFlex offerings. Wireless declined overall, but we did see strength in the ramp of our WiFi 6 products and solid growth in Meraki. Applications was down 5% driven by a decline in Unified Communication and TP end points. We did see growth in conferencing as we saw strong uptake with the COVID-19 environment. We also saw strong double-digit growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. Security was up 6% with strong performance in unified threat management, identity and access and advanced threat. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 5% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 74% of total software revenue, up 9 points year-over-year. In terms of orders in Q3, total product orders were down 5%. During the quarter, there was a slowdown in April as we saw the impact of the COVID-19 environment continue. Looking at our geographies. The Americas was flat, EMEA was down 4%, and APJC was down 22%. Total emerging markets were down 21%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 29%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 1%, while enterprise was down 4%. Commercial was down 11%, and service provider was down 3%. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q3 were $25.5 billion, up 11%. The portion related to product was up 25%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 66.6%, up 2 points. Product gross margin was 65.8%, up 2.1 points. And service gross margin was 68.9%, up 1.6 points year-over-year. The increase in product gross margin was driven by productivity with continued memory cost savings and positive mix, partially offset by pricing. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q3 net income was $2.8 billion, and EPS was $0.65. We ended Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $28.6 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We have a very strong balance sheet, healthy free cash flow generation and the ability to quickly access capital markets. This is a competitive advantage in a challenging environment. Our commitment to our capital allocation program remains unchanged, and we intend to continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders through the return of a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually. In Q3, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for a quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and non-GAAP EPS growth in a very challenging environment. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 8.5% to minus 11.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected in the range from $0.72 to $0.74. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A. Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and plan to open up the line for questions. (Operator Instructions) Michelle?","Yes. Paul, thanks for your question. And you're spot on in how you should think about it. Look, from -- when we look at our customers working from home, there's clearly collaboration capabilities that I discussed around Webex. There's clearly more security that needs to be deployed. And then the question about when they return to the office and how much -- how many people return to the office and what does that mean to the infrastructure supporting their campus environments is certainly one that we're going to be watching. I will tell you that I have had a lot of customers who are not at the center of this crisis who realized during this pandemic that they have a fair amount of technical debt, and they have a lot of aged equipment. And so we don't know what the time frame is, but many of them have said, ""This is going -- this is a wake-up call, and this is going to actually give us air cover to talk to our senior leadership team about upgrading and building out a more robust, modernized infrastructure."" So again, different customers will be able to do that at different paces based on how they're impacted, what their capital situation is. But that's how we think about it going forward, and let's see how it plays out. Kelly, you want to talk at all about pricing? Yes. So yes, Paul, on pricing, we, again, continue to have strong margins this quarter. But I will say some of the dynamics, we did benefit still this quarter because we had built up some inventory on memory at the lower prices. So we benefited greatly from that, which you'll see in the [VCP]. But pricing did get a little bit worse. So pricing, to your question, Paul, from a gross margin rate on product year-over-year, it drove minus 1.9 points on pricing, which is slightly worse than it was year-over-year last quarter and certainly for the quarters ahead, the ones even before that even so. But overall, very, very strong productivity again driven by memory and cost savings as well as positive software mix. And Kelly, you may want to talk about the correlation between the Infrastructure Platform's revenue number and the supply chain. Yes. I mean like I said in the prepared remarks, basically, the majority, if not all, of our supply chain challenges that we had with both components and the factories being impacted was on the Infrastructure Platform side. So that certainly drove a very large chunk of that revenue. Well, I don't think you can compare it to the bubble because we were at the epicenter of that one, so that one felt a lot different. And this one, we are sort of -- we're secondary collateral damage, I would say. But I think the difference here is the broad-based challenges that this thing has presented to customers around the world. And -- but we all know that the response from the Fed, the response from Congress on stimulus and the commitment to the economic acceleration or the attempt to slow the economic deceleration is certainly at a level we've never seen before. So I think that like everybody else, depending on the availability of testing, the availability of therapeutics and clearly at some point when we get a vaccine, I do believe that the one difference that I see in this one is that this came upon us so quickly and so consistently around the world that I do think customers are now stepping back and asking themselves, ""What do I need to do to harden my infrastructure and to better prepare my business for the next time something like this happens?"" Yes. I think, Ittai, let me give you some color, and then Kelly can give you some metrics. But I think if you look over the last couple of years at the Applications business and Collaboration, I think they've performed reasonably well. As you think about what happened with Webex this time, what I will tell you is that our #1 priority was to get customers up and running. And so we have -- we really have 3 categories of opportunity from customers that, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we believe we'll convert to revenue in the future. So we have enterprise customers, many of whom already had licenses who need more licenses, and they've exceeded their usage. And we'll go back and we'll work with them to clean that up in the future. But again, our priority was getting them up and running and just allowing them to be productive. The second is we had a number of new customers, enterprise customers, commercial customers who took advantage of Webex and deployed it for the first time in the 90-day free trial programs that we put out. And then there was a third category, which are more of the individual free accounts that customers would sign up for online. I would say the first 2 categories represent the majority of what we believe to be the revenue opportunity going forward. But that's something we'll see in the future and wasn't really reflected in the quarter that we just announced. So Kelly, you want to make any comments? Yes. I mean the thing I'll say in terms of just helping you think through the size, the relative size of these pieces of applications, monitoring and analytics, the AppD business is, as I said, growing double digit, super strong, very good but still fairly small in terms of the percentage of the overall applications. And then the same thing for the IoT software. So it comes down to collab, traditional collab. And then when I break that down, the biggest chunk of total collab is Unified Communications. And that is where we are seeing the pressure, which we have been seeing, right, in the end points. So that's going to be with us for a while as that goes. We're clearly trying to transition there with some of the things that the teams are building there. But the -- that's a big portion that will continue down for a while, I would guess. But again, conferencing is strong. And like Chuck said, the revenue -- this is the revenue we're talking about. When we look at the demand and when I look at the uptake, the significant uptake we had, the offers we had during this last quarter, just using our normal, what we expect to convert from free to paid is going to be a nice tailwind for us over the next few quarters here. Yes, that's the right way to think about the biggest driver. So Kelly, why don't I give a little color on the Americas and commercial, and then you can give some metrics and talk about the financial -- the programs. So Rod, on the Americas, we had a -- it was certainly stronger than what we saw in Asia and Europe. And frankly, if you just look at the timing of the pandemic, you can see Asia got hit early. So we saw the more consistent decline in the business. What we did see in the Americas and in the U.S. is we saw, obviously, strength in Webex and Security as more -- as the customers executed on their business continuity. We also saw strength in service provider as they build out capacity. So we saw strength in cable. We saw strength in the web scale business. And just to comment on the web scale space, which we haven't talked about in a while, we've been talking for years about how that was a marathon and that we have been investing both in our innovation as well as in the relationships with those customers. And we have had the second quarter in a row of robust growth in that part of the marketplace, which, frankly, is the beginnings of us seeing the results from the years of hard work and reestablishing ourselves there. So I'm really proud of what the teams have done. So that's been a bright spot in the last 2 quarters. On commercial, if you think about it, commercial are midsized enterprises, small, medium businesses. And they have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. So it's not a surprise that, that business is going to be hit a little bit hard here harder than others. And Kelly, do you have any color to add on that and then talk about the financial planning program? Yes. So yes, and also just to add to the U.S., just to add, switching was also up and strong in the America -- in the U.S. -- Americas as well. On commercial, it's a similar story. All of the geos were down, but it was down the least in the Americas followed by EMEA. And the biggest chunk by far, it was down in APJC. So it's directly related to the kind of the geographical look when you look at overall how the orders went. In terms of the capital -- Business Resiliency Program, we really just launched that at the end of April, so like the week or 2 before the quarter ended. So nothing impacted that in the quarter. So in Q4, there will be, I'd say, a small amount. We have a pipeline that we're going through. The early signs of the pipes that we're looking at, there's a big intake -- interest for smaller commercial customers, who haven't really done financing like a lot of health care systems, small health care systems, a lot of small colleges. But -- so there's a pipeline there. So we'll start to see that convert in Q4. From a cash flow perspective, I don't expect a huge impact. There'll be some impact in Q4 and slightly more in Q1, but then they get back onto normal payments in the January month. So we'll be watching that. And hopefully, it's helpful to those customers that haven't leveraged it in the past. But no impact this quarter, and it will be a small impact, I think, in Q4. Yes. Thanks. I guess the good news is that the success we've seen in the web scale space in the last 2 quarters hasn't even seen the impact of the 8000 yet. So it's in trials and lots of customers still -- they have very extended evaluation periods before they deploy it. But I will tell you, it's doing incredibly well in those trials. We're very optimistic about what the teams have built. We feel good about it. Our service provider business was up mid-single digits in orders in the Americas in Q3, which indicates, obviously, the capacity build-outs that some of them we're seeing as well as that web scale business. So we'll see how it goes, but right now, we're very optimistic and feel good about where we are with that platform. And there are more versions of that platform coming. So we've just announced the first couple of members of the family. So I think what we see happening with 5G is a little bit mixed, but generally, there is a tendency for our customers to want to sort of put their foot on the accelerator. I think you heard some of our customers that are looking for permits and with regional governments around the United States and other places that they're not sure they're going to be able to get that done during this pandemic. You got other customers who are saying that they actually are not having a problem. But it's a -- so we think generally, there's going to be an acceleration, particularly as our service provider customers also realize that some element of this work-from-home scenario will not go away. And so we're going to be continuing in the future to work in these very hybrid worlds, where we're going to have even a much broader distribution of where our -- their users will be working from. And I think that that's the reason that they want to continue to accelerate the deployments and the strategies around 5G. I'd say in WiFi 6, I don't see any big significant shift, I'd say, on the cloud. I've had mixed feedback from customers. I think that in general, it's probably a tailwind to cloud. But there are some customers that believe they have a cloud strategy, and this doesn't -- they don't understand why this would change and how they go about it. So -- but it will -- as it relates to our strategy, we are going to continue to accelerate those technologies that help our customers use the cloud more effectively. We are going to -- as our customers -- some of our customers are going to need OpEx offers in the future given CapEx restraints. So we're working on a balance of our portfolio to be delivered in both OpEx and CapEx models to give customers the flexibility that they need. And we're definitely going to continue to accelerate the development and work around our Security portfolio as it relates to remote work and cloud connectivity because we think that's only going to accelerate as well. That's a very good question. I think that -- look, I think we went through a surge for a few weeks where customers were solely focused on business continuity and getting themselves prepared for this work-from-home environment. And then I think they took a breath for a couple of weeks, and then they stepped back. And I could even see it in how we worked as a company. We were solely focused on the immediate virus response, getting our teams up and running, getting our customers up and running, making sure we had investments in the community and all those things. And then frankly, we took a breather. And now even my calendar and the things that we're focused on are much more sort of traditional business issues and how we move forward. And I think our customers are in the same mode. I think, again, they dealt with business continuity. They took a few weeks to figure out, okay, based on this, what -- how do I reprioritize the projects that I have -- that I had planned for the rest of the year. And I think every customer is at a different phase right now on how they're deploying it. And it's going to be very industry-specific as to who moves forward. I'll give you a few examples. Obviously, we're working very closely with higher education because you see in the news the discussion around whether students will be on campus in the fall. As one of the heads of one of the biggest systems in the United States told me, they used anything and everything they could to get students online back in March. And now they need to go step back and actually build the real, robust, long-term architecture that they need. And we're working with them to do that. I think health care is one that they're going to make investments. I think telehealth is here, finally. And I think that's going to change forever. And I think that those -- that industry will continue to work and build out a more robust architecture to support telehealth as opposed to what we put together as quickly as we could with them over the last few months. You got the hospitality, the leisure, the travel that are going to struggle, which is one of the big reasons we wanted to make sure we got our financing program out there, candidly, is if they need to make investments during this time, we want to help them do that. Not only is it the right thing to do, but they remember afterwards that we were partners to them during their tough time. And I think you see financial services moving ahead. So it's going to vary greatly by industry, but I think we're going to have better visibility in the next 60 days or so. Tal, that's a good question. So I would say, yes, we had another strong quarter in Q3. And again, it has been driven by like their solution support and their software support. That continues to be a big driver of it. But your point of what you're hearing from other companies is absolutely true on what's happening to us. I would say that I expect pressure. In my guide for Q4, I have some pressure to services there. And where we're seeing it is on things that are like in our advanced services, our proactive services, consulting kind of things, those things that are either discretionary or you only make progress when you're actually in the enterprises. Those are seeing pressure that I think we'll see translate like hitting milestones or doing projects. And then in terms of the maintenance, there is a lag usually on infrastructure maintenance. When the orders drag, it's usually a lag for a while. So we'll start to feel maybe a little bit of that in the upcoming quarters. But overall, that's a very solid business. And we've gone through cycles like this before, and we always come out pretty strong on that. But I think your point is a fair point. I think that we're better positioned for sure, and you would expect me to say that. But I do believe it. I think that we've spent the last few years driving a significant refresh across our enterprise portfolio, across our service provider offerings, our 5G packet core capabilities. Our security portfolio is robust. We spent the last 2 years rebuilding and modernizing the Webex architecture as well as unifying the user interface. We've now gone through 2 months of building out capacity on a global basis. Webex was the largest platform in the world in February, and now it's 3x what it was then. So we built that out. And I think that if you look at the software content in our product portfolio and the percentage of our revenue that, that represents and the percentage of that is coming from subscriptions and SaaS versus where we were in 2008, I think all of those things just position us more effectively than perhaps we would have been back then. So I feel good about where we are. And I think that our balance sheet is strong. Obviously, our ability to navigate this financially is strong. So I feel good. And I wasn't running the company in 2008, clearly, but I was here. And it just feels like we're fortunate that we've spent the last few years doing complete refreshes on almost all of our technology. So we have very relevant new offers for our customers right now. Yes. Thanks, Jim. I will tell you this. The number of e-mails that I've gotten from my peers from virtually every industry about what our teams did to help them, many of them saying, ""We had to get 150,000 people up and running remotely over VPN, and you guys helped us do that overnight. And for that, we're gracious."" Or around Webex and how they couldn't be running their business right now if it wasn't for Webex. And I mean -- so we hosted an advisory board call with about 50 of our strategic customers around the world last week or the week before. I can't remember exactly when it was at this point. And they spent like the majority of the first 1/3 of the call just going through stories of gratitude around what our teams have done. And I tell you that because I think what's happened is, to your point, Jim, I think there is a tendency during these times, you want to work with companies that you believe are strong or solid and are great partners and are going to do whatever it takes to make you successful during these times. And I think that's what our customers believe we do. I think, again, as I said earlier, you're going to have some customers right now that are going to look at their infrastructure, the CEOs are looking at it and saying, ""I will never be this unprepared for something like this again."" And if there's a wave 2 coming in the fall, many of them may say, ""We need to work on a lot of this right now."" I don't know that yet, but we think there could be. I talked earlier about what we see in certain industries, where there'll be investments like higher ed. Right now, frankly, there's K-12 contingency plans being made even though I know most K-12 institutions would much rather be teaching those kids in schools for obvious reasons, but it's also not a definite that they'll be going back into the classroom of the fall. So that's happening. The pharmaceuticals and the drug manufacturers are working to beef up their infrastructure for all the research, building up their cyber infrastructure for obvious reasons. So there's a lot of things that are going really well. But then again, you have industries that are at the heart of this crisis, who I wouldn't expect to make significant investments until we get to the other side. Yes, Pierre, that's a very good question. I'm going to give you just my pure instinct on this. I think that any customer who potentially could be at risk in 3 to 6 months is already pausing. I don't think that anybody is going to be aggressive right now because any of us can see if we have liquidity issues, we have solvency issues, we have anything that is 3 to 6 months away, my peers, we're all planning -- we're working on that right now. No one's waiting. So I think most of the impact that you'll see in the next 6 or 9 months, I think, those customers who were impacted, let me say it that way, they know they're impacted. I will tell you from our perspective, if you map the industries that we believe will continue to invest against our customer base, there's a good correlation that a lot of the industries that we believe will invest are already a large percentage of our customer makeup. So whether you look at public sector, service providers, financial services, higher education. I mean these are all big pieces of business for us, and we think that all those and others will also continue to invest. So it's mixed. But to answer your specific question, I think anyone who's going to be in trouble 3 to 6 months from now is already pausing and has already been impacted. Yes. That's a great question. I think you've even heard from some of our competitors on their earnings calls where they had planned on entering markets, and they've acknowledged that it's going to be more difficult to do that during this time in areas where we have good market share. And again, I'll remind you that in those areas like in the Campus, we have probably the most robust portfolio we've had in a decade. So we're very -- in very good shape with the portfolio. And I think, again, customers, they are -- in times like these, they want to go with people they trust and know. And I think that will work in our favor. But on the -- in the areas, to your point, where we can take share, I think certainly, the web scale play that we've been running for the last 4, 4.5 years, I think, is one area over the next year. I think in the service provider space with the 8000s and recapturing some routing share because of those portfolios. And both of those sets of customers, they will continue doing the evaluations and the new deployments because they have to, because they have just requirements that are increasing on a daily basis. And I think that in the carrier space with 5G and the access networks, the backhaul networks, the core networks with the 8000 and some of our other technology we've come out with, I think we can take share there as well. So I feel good about where we are, and the things that we are in control of right now, I think we're in a pretty good position. All right. Thanks, Tim, and that was the last question of our call. Yes. So let me just close quickly by, first of all, thanking all of you for being with us and just telling you all that we hope that you're safe and your family is safe and you continue to be safe. I also want to just reiterate our gratitude for the frontline workers. And these are the health care workers, the first responders, some of our colleagues locally who are in the homeless camps, helping try to stem the tide of this pandemic flowing through those kinds of environments, those people who live paycheck to paycheck, who are struggling right now. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody, and our gratitude is especially with those who are on the frontlines. We look forward to getting to the other side of this, and we look forward to doing our part in helping our customers and helping society actually thrive as much as possible during this very difficult time. So thanks for being with us today on our call. Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings call, which will reflect our Q4 2020 and annual results, will be on Wednesday, August 12 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations group. And we thank you very much for joining today's call.","I'm torn whether to ask you about the infrastructure decline. So let me focus on that. Chuck and Kelly, maybe you could comment on pricing as a courtesy and the other aspects of the fine gross margin performance. But if I could ask you on the infrastructure side, the thought arises given that so many organizations shifted to work from home that's likely to persist to some degree. What's your outlook in terms of the benefits from the work from home in terms of the need for your solution for robust connectivity? But also the potential negative aspect, fewer employees within the 4 walls of the enterprise, how does that impact campus switching and wireless LAN? If you could, any insight would be appreciated. Great. I appreciate that. Chuck, can you compare this to 10 years ago, to the financial crisis and 20 years ago to the bubble? I guess I had a question about applications. Just given the push with Webex and AppDynamics, I was a little bit surprised it was down on a year-over-year basis. I guess, Chuck, can you give me a little bit more transparency here and give us kind of a better understanding of the relative revenue levels of Webex and AppDynamics versus the unified IP? It's clearly declining and then overshadowing those businesses. I'm trying to understand, how close are we to a bottom in the declining businesses where the growth in the growth businesses can finally be transparent on an overall product category? Got it. And when you say end point, just to clarify, mostly IP, is that the right way to think about this? I guess I've got 2. One is regarding the order volumes. I wondered if you guys could juxtapose the fact that the U.S. is kind of surprisingly flat after being down 8% last quarter. And then also the commercial order acceleration on the downside. Could you guys dig into the regional effects? Is that mostly APAC that's driving that? Or is -- was it also weak in the U.S.? And then the second question I had is on the $2.5 billion financing plan that you guys announced. I don't know, Kelly, could you give us some idea of how that affects cash flow? Like is it affecting cash flow in this quarter? And then how should we expect it to unwind in the cash flow over the next few quarters? I know you stated that routing was both down for SP and enterprise, but you also mentioned solid progress with web scale customers for 2 consecutive quarters. And given some of the big shifts you have made to work from home and also given the fact that you launched some new products in just December of 2019, how have the products like the Series 8000 performed during this entire shift? Are you seeing things accelerate or adoption of product accelerate? Or has adoption been a bit slower than your expectations? And maybe just a general update on the product. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. I just wanted to get your thoughts around some of your key initiatives given the macro backdrop. Specifically, as you look at cloud, WiFi 6 or 400 gig, are you seeing any acceleration of demand or vice versa push out there versus your expectations 90 days ago given the change in environment? Great. Understanding the end of March and beginning of April were largely work from home or business continuity focus with customers, but as we get into kind of this new normal, do you feel like customers have had an initial sense of what revised budget look like -- budget outlooks are looking like for 2020? Or are customers still relatively uncertain that you're talking to? Services was the -- one of the only areas that grew both sequentially and year-over-year. And the question is why don't we see the impact of -- first of all, what are the drivers for that? And why don't we see the impact of COVID-19? We're hearing from others that customers are less willing because of the uncertainty to sign on contracts that are longer than 1 year. So they see the parallel decline in services. I just -- I would like to get an update on this space. And how long does it take it to follow the trends in Infrastructure Platforms and the other products? I guess a fairly common question I get on you guys is how does Cisco stack up this time versus the past recessions like '08 and '09, for example. So it would be really helpful to maybe get your perspective on how do you think Cisco handles and performs through this cycle versus past one and really to get to the bottom on how Cisco is different and perhaps better positioned to manage this correction versus the past one would be helpful. Can you talk a little bit about enterprise, the orders, the trends, maybe the monthly cadence? And importantly, the color or commentary you have as enterprises are working from home with their employees, keeping their networks up and running, potentially delaying things, how does it kind of look as you go forward? Because it seems like a typical request for proposals might be a little bit different discussions now. And what I mean is, say, for example, does this help the incumbency of Cisco a little more to give you more visibility to, hey, Chuck, when things return back to normal in 3 years, 6 months or at some point, hey, do we have a buildup of more visibility than we -- what we currently have? If you could just help us with the enterprise, some commentary, that would be great. Chuck, I'd like to come back to your -- just the very last comment you made. You said some industries are getting hit very hard now, and it's going to be tough for them to make investments before we get on the other side of the crisis. And so what I'm trying to figure out is how much of the economy is already in a situation of feeling the pain, cutting IT budget and how much of the economy is not there yet and actually at risk of getting into that stage, maybe in 3 months or even in 6 months from now because as you say, the enterprises are like maintaining continuity, are actually more into a mode of making the right spending to keep the business running. But maybe in 3 to 6 months, they're going to actually start getting the more of macro pains, the recessionary environment hurting their business as well. And so my question is really how much are we into that already. What percentage of the economy has been hurt? And what percentage could be hurt further down the line? Chuck, I wanted to ask about competition, kind of a twofold question here. Number one, if you think about some of the pieces of your business where some competitors have been trying to take share of enterprise, networking comes to mind where several companies are focused on gaining share there. What do you think this major pandemic disruption does to other's ability to maybe disrupt the high market share that you have? And then conversely, if you think about some of the markets where Cisco has a real opportunity to gain share, it sounds like cloud would be one of those, and you guys are doing well. But do you think there's any of the markets where you're poised to take some share that are impacted either positively or negatively?
