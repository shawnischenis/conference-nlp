AAPL,Q2 2016,3743,3466,1627,"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, growth margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apples Form 10-K for 2015, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of FY16, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective date. In addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our investor relations website at Apple.com/investor. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program. Revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world, and difficult year-over-year comparisons. We saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year-on-year. Despite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from services. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations, but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter, when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades, and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: Customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models, customers who switch from Android and other operating systems, and customers who purchase a smart phone for the first time. As we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. First, from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year, the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know, was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of US smart phone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smart phone. Second, we continued to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever. And third, with only 42% smart phone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smart phone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India, our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago. Next, I'd like to talk about services, which was our second-largest revenue generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record, and Apple Music continues to grow in popularity with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline. The services business is powered by our huge installed base of active device, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter. The reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand, following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter, and last week's roll-out in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than 5 times the transaction volume of a year ago, and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched today, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon. Turning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations, in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 unites. Overall, the Mac continues to attract  a large percentage of new customers. In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac, and in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business, and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area. Turning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expected seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December  quarter. We started shipping Apple  Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smart watch in the world. In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year. Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. Apple Watch is an increasingly essential part of user's lives, from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping them  be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future ahead. We announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. iPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second-quarter results, but so far this quarter, we're seeing terrific customer response. iPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features, and a great price, without compromising performance. Demand has been very strong, and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. We also unveiled the stunning 9.7 inch iPad Pro, with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we are hearing from customers of the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners, and a great PC replacement. In the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years. iPad is the best-selling, best-reviewed and  most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn, and create. We also announced Care Kit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health, by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us. As always, we are contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain, and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling in the materials we use. We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we are actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business. As we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the macroeconomic environment we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary. But before turning over the call to him, I will summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. We are very excited about bringing together developers for our four major platforms at our worldwide developers conference in June. We are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and services roadmaps, and we are always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, and strategic fit. Creating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority, and the key factor driving our investments and capital allocation decisions. As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago. Today, we are announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion. Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca? Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results. Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range at $50.6 billion, compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%. As we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies. That being said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. However our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both of these segments. In mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare, when our mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long-term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run. Gross margin was 39.4%, near the high-end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was 27.7% of revenue, and net income was $10.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.90, and cash flow from operations was strong, at $11.6 billion. For details by product, I start with iPhone. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, compared to 61.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 16%. It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago, when iPhone 6 grew 40% as we entered last March quarter, and supply demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter. Also, this year we reduced channel inventory by 450,000 units, while we increased inventory by 1 million units a year ago. We have exited the quarter with in our five to seven-week target range for channel  inventory. iPhone ASV was $642 compared to $659 in the year ago quarter, with weak international currencies and very popular mid-tier and entry offerings contributing to the difference year-over-year. iPhone's momentum in business markets continues to be very impressive. A recent survey by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, found that among US corporate buyers planning to purchase smart phones in the June quarter, 78% planned to purchase iPhones. That's the highest June quarter iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and 5 points higher than a year ago. Turning to services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% over the March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continued strong performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all-time high. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 90% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter, up from a 75% lead in 2015. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes Stores, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all-time record in the March quarter. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4 million Macs compared to 4.6 million last year, a decline of 12%. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, but we believe we gained market share. Despite the overall market slowdown, we generated double-digit market growth in a number of markets, including Russia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UAE. Just last week, we updated the MacBook, our thinnest and lightest Mac, with the latest processors, faster graphics, fastest flash storage, and longer battery life. We think our customers are going to love this update. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 10.3 million compared to 12.6 million in the year ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 200,000 units, and we exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range. In the same segments of the public market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 78% share of the US market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by ABC indicates that iPad accounts for 72% of the US commercial tablet market, comprising business, government, and education. iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In February, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2, and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 59% planned to purchase an iPad, more than 3 times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad, and a June quarter purchase intent of 71%. Revenue from other products grew 30% over the last year, thanks to Apple Watch. We have expanded distribution to 60 countries, and introduced bands in beautiful new colors for spring, so customers can personalize their watches in more ways, with a range of colors, styles, and materials. Our customers are very happy with Apple Watch, with 451 Research measuring 94% customer satisfaction. We're also making great progress with our enterprise initiatives. IBM now has engagements for more than 200 deployments of native iOS apps for large enterprise customers to accelerate mobile transformation. Our mobility partner program also continues to grow, with 108 partners across 20 countries. We see continued broad industry adoption of native iOS apps to transform how professionals do their work and serve their customers. For example, retail bankers are using iOS apps on iPads to greet and onboard customers, reduce queue times, and improve the customer experience. And in hospitals, using doctors and nurses are using iOS Apps on iPhone and iPad to share and communicate more effectively, so that they can spend more time with patients, and less time on administrative tasks. Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $232.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $17.2 billion. $208.9 billion of this cash, or 90% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $15.5 billion in US dollar denominated notes during the quarter, including our first green bond tranche to fund initiatives such as renewable energy and environmental design projects. We exited the March quarter with $72 billion in term debt. We returned   $10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $7 billion on purchases of 71.8 million Apple shares, to open market transactions. We have now completed over $163 billion of the current $200 billion capital return program, including $117 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we are announcing the latest update to our program, which we are increasing to a total of $250 billion. Once again, we are allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, and the value we see in our stock. The Board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $140 billion level to $175 billion. We will also continue to net share settle, less the employee restricted stock units. We also know that the dividend is very important to many of our investors who value income, and we are raising it for the fourth time in less than four years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of about 10%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the Board has declared today is payable on May 12, 2016, to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2016. We continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters, we expect to return $87 billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of our market cap at the current stock price. As in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with US cash, future US cash flow generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, and solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the face of the program. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $41 billion and $43 billion. The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year decline, as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year, when revenue grew 33%, due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases. This tough compare is compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year, and the strong US dollar, which affects our revenue growth in international markets. Embedded in this guidance is a planned channel inventory reduction worth  over $2 billion, as we have elected to be prudent about our channel inventory position, given the current macro environment. The guidance also reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into supply-demand balance for iPhone SE. Due to these factors, our expected demand is greater than the revenue range implies. Sequentially, our guidance implies a revenue decline of 15% to 19%, which is comparable to the 17% sequential decline that we've averaged from the March to June quarter for the last three years, despite the anticipated channel inventory adjustments I just described. We expect seasonal sequential declines in iPhone and iPad sales, and a sequential increase in Mac sales. We also expect iPhone ASPs to decline sequentially as we get further from the launch of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and as iPhone SE enters the mix. We know that our revenue guidance falls short of market estimates for the third quarter. We believe the difference counts primarily from three areas: First, the $2 billion plus channel inventory reduction I just mentioned. Second, the effect of the channel inventory reduction, and the launch of iPhone SE on iPhone ASPs, as well as the current constrained supply of iPhone SE. Third, different estimates for Mac, which we expect to grow sequentially at the rate similar to what we have experienced in the past June quarters. We expect gross margins to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect continued cost improvements to be more than offset by the sequential loss of leverage from lower revenue, and a differing mix of products. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Thank you, Luca. (Caller Instructions) Operator, may we have the first question, please?","Simona, let me give you the data point on the sell through and then I'll let Tim answer the strategic question. We had a channel inventory reduction that was worth a bit less than $800 million a year ago. Simona, this is Tim. In terms of do I think the smart phone market is mature? I think that the market, as you know, is currently not growing. However, my view of that is that's an overhang of the macroeconomic environment in many different places in the world. We're very optimistic that this too shall pass, and that the market and particularly us will grow again. The reason that we're optimistic is we look at sort of the three places that iPhone sales come from, and from an upgrade point of view, as I mentioned in my comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s. We are lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that was an extraordinary cycle, that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015, and so that comparable will be tough for this year, but that's a transitory thing. As we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half we have set a record from switchers from other platforms. The largest we've ever seen in any six month period before, so we've got traction there. And then on emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%, and we're placing increasing emphasis in these areas, where it's clear there will be disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas. The next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract even more customers into the platform, with incredible product that is at a new price point for us, with the latest technology. And so we're optimistic about attracting even more customers with that. We also look at our pipeline, and were very excited about what's in our pipeline. All of those things make me optimistic. Your other question was on M&A, and regardless of the first, we're always looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do today, become features in something we to, or allow us to accelerate entry into a category that we are excited about. As I have said before, our test is not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we have bought thus far. It's more about the strategic fit, and whether it's  a great technology and great people. We continue to look, and we stay very active in the M&A market. Thank you. Could we have the next question please? I think the SE is attracting two types of customers. One is   customers that wanted the latest technology, but wanted it in a more compact package. And we clearly see even more people than we thought in that category. Secondly, it's attracting people aspire to own an iPhone, but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've established a new entry. I think both of these markets are very, very important to us, and we are really excited about where it can take us. I do think that we will be really happy with the new to iPhone customers that we see from here, because of the early returns we've had. We are currently supply constrained, but we'll be able to work our way out of this at some point. But it's great to see the overwhelming demand for it. I will let Luca comment on the ASPs. On the ASPs, Gene we mentioned that we were going to be down sequentially, and this is really the combination of two factors. So when we go from the March quarter to the June quarter, is the fact that we are having the SE entering the mix, and that obviously is going to have a downward pressure on ASP, and also this channel inventory reduction that we have talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs. The question on services, when we look at our services business, obviously growing very well across the board. The biggest element, and the part of the services business that is growing very well, we mentioned 35%, is the App Store. It's interesting for us that our music business, which had been declining for a number of quarters, now that we have both a download model and a streaming model, we have now hit an inflection point, and we believe that this would be the bottom, and we can start growing from there over time. We have many other services businesses that are doing very well, we have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly. Faster than the App Store, from a much lower base but I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses. Tim have talked about Apple Pay. It doesn't provide a meaningful financial contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that go into Apple Pay right now, and we think ahead for the long-term, that could be an interesting business for us, as well. From a profitability standpoint, we have mentioned last time that when you look at it on a gross basis, so in terms of purchase value of these services, the profitability of the business is similar to Company average. Of course, when you met out the amount that is paid to developers, and you look at it, in terms of what is reported in our P&L, obviously that business has a profitability that is higher than Company average. We don't get into the specifics of specific products or services, but it is very clear it is significantly higher than Company average. Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question please? Katy, clearly the commodity environment remains quite favorable, and we continue to expect cost improvements. The other dynamics that you have mentioned are still there, obviously what is different, and particularly as we look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we would have loss of leverage, and that obviously is going to have a negative impact on margins. The other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of products. Particularly when you look at iPhone, what I was mentioning to Gene earlier, I think we've got a couple of things that are affecting not only ASPs, but obviously, they also affects margins. And it's the fact that we have a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range, and we've got the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range. And so when you take into account those factors, those are the big elements that drive our guidance range right now. Katy, in the short term, let me just make a couple of comments on the developed markets, just to make sure this is clear. If you look at our installed base of iPhone today versus two years ago, it's increased by 80%. When you think about upgrade cycles, upgrade cycles would have varying rates on it. As I talked about on the comments, the iPhone 6s rate, upgrade rate is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s, but lower than the iPhone 6. But the other multiplier in that equation is obviously the size of the installed base. The net of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off. It's our job to come up with great products that people desire, and also to continue to attract over Android switchers. With our worldwide share there's still quite a bit of room in the developed markets, as well. From an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back, perhaps, but some others as well, is that the LTE rollout with India just really begins this year. So we will begin to see some really good networks coming on in India. That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone, in a way that an older network, 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do. The infrastructure is one key one, and the second one is building the channel out. Unlike the US as an example, where the carriers in the US sell the vast majority of phones that are sold in the United States, in India, the carriers in general sell virtually no phones, and it is out in retail, and retail is many, many different small shops. We've been in the process. It's not something we just started in the last few weeks. We've been working in India now for a couple of years or more, but we've been working with great energy over the last 18 months or so, and I am encouraged by the results that we're beginning to see there, and believe there's a lot, lot more there. It is already the third largest smart phone market in the world, but because the smart phones that are working there are low-end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there. I  view India as where China was maybe 7 to 10 years ago from that point of view. I think there's a really great opportunity there. Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please? Toni, it's Tim. Let me see if I can address your question. The channel inventory reduction that Luca referred to, the vast, vast majority of that is in iPhone. That would affect the unit compare that you maybe thinking about. The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on it. It is clear that there is a demand there, even much beyond what we thought, and so that is really why we have the constraint that we have. Do I think it will be like the iPad Mini? No, I don't think so. I don't see that. I think the tablet market in general, one of the challenges with the tablet market is that the replacement cycle is materially different than in the smart phone market. As you probably know, we haven't had an issue in customer satisfaction on the iPad. It is incredibly high, and we haven't had an issue with usage of the iPad. The usage is incredibly high. But the consumer behavior there is you tend to hold on for very long period of time, before an upgrade. We continue to be very optimistic on the iPad business, and as I have said in my remarks, we believe we are going to have the best compare for iPad revenue this quarter that we have quite some time. We will report back in July on that one, but I think iPhone has a particularly different kind of cycle to it than the tablet market. There's a lot there. Let me just say I don't recall saying the things that you said I said about the upgrade cycle, so let me get that out of the way. Now let me describe without the specific numbers, the iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that we have measured for the first half of this year, so the first six months of our fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw with the iPhone 5s two years ago, but it's lower than the iPhone 6. I don't mean just a hair lower, it's a lot lower. Without giving you exact numbers, if we would have the same rate on 6s that we did 6, there would -- it will be time for a huge party. It would be a huge difference. The great news from my point of view is, I think we are strategically positioned very well, because we have announced the SE, we are attracting customers that we previously didn't attract. That's really great, and this tough compare eventually isn't the benchmark. The install base is up 80% over the last two years, and so all of those I think bode well, and the switcher comments I made earlier, I wouldn't underestimate that, because that's very important for us in every geography. Thanks for the question. Thanks, Toni. Can we have the next question please? Shannon, thanks for the question. If you take greater China, we include Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China in the greater China segment that you see reported on your data sheet. The vast majority of the weakness in the greater China region sits in Hong Kong, and our perspective on that is, it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the US dollar, and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the US dollar, and that has driven tourism, international shopping and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago. If you look at mainland China, which is one that I am personally very focused on, we are down 11% in mainland China, on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, we are only down 7%, and the way that we really look at the health or underlying demand is look at sell-through, and if you look at there, we were down 5%. Keep in mind that is down 5% on comp a year ago that was up 81%. As I  back up from this and look at the larger picture, I think China is not weak, as has been talked about. I see China as -- may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's a lot more stable than what I think is the common view of it. We remain really optimistic on China. We opened seven stores there during the quarter. We are now at 35. We will open 5 more this quarter to achieve 40, which we had talked about before. And the LTE adoption continues to rise there, but it's got a long way ahead of it. And so we continue to be really optimistic about it, and just would ask folks to  look underneath the numbers at the details in them before concluding anything. Thanks for the question. It is Luca. Of course, we think about it. We think about it a lot, and so when you look at our results, for example, our OpEx for the quarter, for the March quarter was up 10%, which is the lowest rate that you have seen in years. And when you look within OpEx, you actually see two different dynamics. You see continued significant investments in research and development, because we really believe that's the future of the Company. We continue to invest in initiatives and projects ahead of revenue. We had a much broader portfolio that we used to have. We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make. And so that parts we didn't need to protect, and we want to continue to invest in the business, right? And then when you look at our SG&A portion of OpEx for the March quarter, it was actually down slightly. So obviously we think about it, and of course we look at our revenue trends, and we take measures accordingly. When you look at the guidance that we provided for the June quarter, that 10% year-over-year increase that I mentioned to you for the March quarter goes down to a range of 7% to 9% up, and again, the focus is on making investments in Road and continuing to run SG&A extremely tightly, and in a very disciplined way. As you know, our E2R, expense to revenue ratio, is around 10%. It's something that we are very proud of, it's a number that is incredibly competitive in our industry, and we want to continue to keep it that way. At the same time, we don't want to under-invest in the business. Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please? The most important thing for us, Steve, is that we want to have a great customer experience, so overwhelmingly, the thing that drives us are to embark on services that help that, and become a part of the ecosystem. The reality is that in doing so, we have developed a very large and profitable business in the services area, and so we felt last quarter and working up to that, that we should pull back the curtain so that people could -- our investors could see the services business, both in terms of the scale of it, and the growth of it. As we said earlier, the purchase value of the installed base services grew by 27% during the quarter, which was an acceleration over the previous quarter, and the value of it hit -- was just shy of $10 billion. It's huge, and we felt it was important to spell that out. What we've seen is that it depends on what you compare it to. If you compare to the 5s, what we are seeing is the upgrade rate today is slightly higher, or that there are more people upgrading, if you will, in a similar time period, in terms of a rate, than the 5s. But if you compare to 6, you would clearly arrive at the opposite conclusion. I think it depends on people's reference points, and we thought it very important in this call to be very clear and transparent about what we're seeing. I think in retrospect, you could look at it and say, maybe the appropriate measure is more to the 5s, and I think everybody intuitively thought that the upgrades were accelerated with the 6, and in retrospect, when you look at the periods, they clearly were. Thanks, Steve. Could we have our next question, please? I think you're probably indirectly asking about our trough comment, if you will, from last quarter. And when we made that, we did not contemplate or comprehend that we were going to make a $2 billion-plus reduction in channel inventory during this quarter. So if you factor that in and look at true customer demand, which is the way that we look at internally, I think you'll find a much more reasonable comparison. Yes, Rod, these are new regulations, and we are in the processing of assessing them. Frankly from first read, we don't anticipate that they are going to have any material impact on our tax situation. Some of them relate to inversion transactions, obviously that's not an issue for us. Some of them are around internal debt financing, which is not something that we use, so we don't expect any issue there. As you know, we are the largest US taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full US tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States, so we don't expect them to have any impact on us on tax reform. I will let Tim continue to  provide more color, but we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate tax reform in this country. We continue to do that. We think a reform of the tax code would have significant benefits for the entire US economy, and we remain optimistic that we are going to get to a point where we can see that tax reform enacted. At that point in time, of course, we would have much more flexibility around optimizing our capital structure, and around providing more return of capital to our investors. The only thing I would add, Rod, is I think there are a growing number of people in both parties that would like to see comprehensive reform, and so I'm optimistic that it will occur. It's just a matter of when and that's difficult to say. But I think most people do recognize that it is in the US's interest to do this. Thank you, Rod.

Thanks again for joining us.","My first question was actually just a clarification, in terms of putting in context that $2 billion in channel inventory reduction. What was that last year, just to help us make the comparison on a year-over-year basis? The bigger question, Tim was, with the smart phone market now reaching a pretty mature growth base, how does Apple think of itself going forward? Is it a growth company, or is it a more mature tech company? And if it's still the former, how does that change how you think about M&A especially given the position you're in with your balance sheet strategically? Thank you. Good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about the iPhone ASP trends, and specifically you mentioned that the SE is going to impact, but how are you thinking about the aspirational market share that's out there, and your actual market share, and using price to close that gap? Is it just the SE or could there be other iPhone models that will be discounted, to try to be more aggressive in emerging markets? And one for Luca. Can you talk a little bit about the services segment, in terms of what piece of the services is driving growth, and maybe a little bit about the profitability on a net basis versus the growth basis that you  have referred to in the past. Thanks. Thank you. Yes, thank you. First for Luca. This is the worst gross margin guide in a year and a half or so, and over the last couple of quarters, you have talked about number of tailwinds including component cost, the lower accounting deferrals that went into effect in September. You just mentioned the services margins are above corporate average. So the question is, are some of those tailwinds winding down? Or is a significant guide down in gross margin for the June quarter entirely related to volume and the 5 SE? And then I have a follow-up for Tim. Okay. Thank you. And that a question for Tim, appreciate the optimism around longer-term iPhone unit growth, but with developed market penetration in anywhere from 60% to 80%, the growth is going to have to come from new markets. You talked about India. Could you just spend a little bit more time on that market? What are some of the hurdles you have to overcome, for that to be a larger part of the business? When we expect Apple to have more distribution, and specifically your own stores in that country? Thanks. I have one, and then a follow-up, as well. My sense is that you talked about adjusting for the changes in channel inventory, that you are guiding for relatively normal sequential growth. And I think if you do the math it's probably the same or perhaps a touch worse in terms of iPhone unit growth sequentially, relative to normal seasonality between fiscal Q2 and Q3. I guess the question is, given that you should be entering new markets and you should see pronounced elasticity from the SE device, why wouldn't we be seeing something that was dramatically above normal seasonal, in terms of iPhone revenues and units for this quarter? Maybe you could push back on me, but I can't help thinking that when Apple introduced the iPad Mini in a similar move, to move down market, there was great growth for one quarter, and the iPad never grew again and margins and ASPs went down. It looks like you are introducing the SE, and at least on a sequential basis, you not calling for any uplift, even adjusting for channel inventory, and ASPs I presume will go down and certainly it's impacting gross margins as you've guided to. Could you respond to, A, why you're not seeing the elasticity, and B, is the analogy with the iPad mini completely misplaced? Okay, and if I could follow-up, Tim. You alluded to replacement cycles and differences between the iPad and the iPhone. My sense was, when you were going through the iPhone 6 cycle, was that you had commented that the upgrade cycle was not materially different. I think your characterization was that it accelerated a bit in the US, but international had grown to be a bigger part of your business, and replacement cycles there were typically a little bit longer. I'm wondering if it was only a modest difference between the 5s and the 6, how big a difference are we really seeing in terms of replacement cycles across the last three generations, and maybe you could help us, if the replacement cycle was flat this year relative to what you saw last year, how different would your results have been this quarter in the first half? I have a couple of questions. One, Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China? The greater China revenue I think was down 26%. You did talk about mainland China, but if you could talk about some of the trends you're seeing there, and how you think it's playing out, and maybe your thoughts on SE adoption within  China as well. Thanks. My second question is with regard to OpEx leverage, or thinking about when I look at the revenue, your revenue is below our expectations but OpEx is pretty much in line. So how are you thinking about potential for leverage, cost containment, maybe when macro is bad and revenue is under pressure, and how are you juggling that versus the required investment you need to go forward? Thank you. Tim,  I first wanted to ask you about services and how do you view services? You've obviously highlighted it the last two quarters. Do you view it going forward as a primary driver of earnings, or do you view it, and you mentioned platforms in terms of your operating systems, which I would agree with. In that scenario I would argue it's more a supporter of the ecosystem, and a supporter of the hardware margins over time, and therefore somewhat subservient to hardware. It's great that it's growing, but longer-term, I would view its role as more creating an ecosystem that supports the high margins on the hardware, as opposed to independently driving earnings. How do you think about it? Okay, and then going back to the upgrades of the installed base, you have clearly mentioned that you've  pulled forward some demand, which makes sense, but there does seem to be a lengthening of the upgrade cycle, particularly in the US. AT&T and Verizon have talked about that. Investors I think perceive  that maybe the marginal improvements on the phone might be less currently, and could be less going forward. At the same time, I think you just announced that you can get the upgrade program online, which I guess potentially could shorten it. Do you believe that upgrade cycles are currently lengthening, and can continue to do so? Thank you. Yes, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to start with a general, more general question. I guess, Tim, this one is aimed at you. As you think about where you thought things were going to head last quarter, when you reported to us, and how it's changed this quarter, obviously it's kind of a disappointing demand environment. Can you just help us understand what maybe the top two or three things are that have changed? And so as we walk away from this, we understand what the differences are, and what the direction of change is? Then I have a follow-up. Okay, great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask you about the tax situation a little bit. Treasury obviously has made some rule changes, and I wonder, maybe if Luca, you could comment on what the impact to Apple from those is, if anything? and Tim, maybe more broadly how you see the tax situation for Apple looking forward? Thanks. Great, thanks. PRELIMINARY TRANSCRIPT: ""Preliminary Transcript"" indicates that the Transcript has been published in near real-time by an experienced professional transcriber.

At this point, believes March qtr. faces most difficult YoverY compare relative to rest of year.","<Sync id=""L171""/>Thank you, Simona.  <Sync id=""L172""/>Let me take this one. <Sync id=""L173""/>In constant currency, when you look at it for the March quarter, revenue would be down between 5% and 10%.  <Sync id=""L174""/>So we are looking at a 400 basis point impact from foreign exchange for the March quarter. <Sync id=""L175""/>You talked about a number of issues that are, in fact, included in this guidance.  <Sync id=""L176""/>In addition to lapping, of course, a very strong year ago quarter -- just remind you that revenue growth a year ago was up 27% -- there's a number of things that we're facing. <Sync id=""L177""/>The macroeconomic environment is weakening.  <Sync id=""L178""/>When you think about all the -- particularly all the commodity-driven economies, Brazil and Russia and emerging markets, but also Canada, Australia in developed markets -- clearly, the economy is significantly weaker than a year ago. <Sync id=""L179""/>We talked about the unfavorable FX, which again is 400 basis points. <Sync id=""L180""/>One of the things that we've done to respond to the foreign exchange situation has been to increase the price of some of our products in certain international markets.  <Sync id=""L181""/>That has had the effect of protecting our margins, which you've seen have been very strong, both in the December quarter and in the guidance that we provide for the March quarter. <Sync id=""L182""/>But inevitably over time, higher prices affect demand and so we are capturing that in our guidance.  <Sync id=""L183""/>So I would say these are the major reasons and the drivers for the guidance on revenue. <Sync id=""L185""/>Thank you, Simona.  <Sync id=""L186""/>Could we have the next question, please? <Sync id=""L194""/>On your first question about iPhone, I think the most important thing, Gene, as you know for us, will always be the product and the experience.  <Sync id=""L195""/>And so that's first and foremost. <Sync id=""L196""/>Secondly, I would say we were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter. <Sync id=""L197""/>It was the highest ever by far.  <Sync id=""L198""/>And so we see that as a huge opportunity. <Sync id=""L199""/>Thirdly, the markets, sort of the emerging markets broader than BRIC, but including all of emerging,  when I look at our share in these markets and the LTE penetration, I see huge opportunities. <Sync id=""L200""/>In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern. <Sync id=""L201""/>How much of that plays out in the Q1 of 2017 range is difficult to say. <Sync id=""L202""/>My own sense would be that the other items I've mentioned are probably more important, but I am optimistic about the upgrade program, as well. <Sync id=""L204""/>In terms of virtual reality, no, I don't think it's a niche. <Sync id=""L205""/>I think it can be -- it's really cool and has some interesting applications. <Sync id=""L206""/>Thank you, Gene. <Sync id=""L208""/>Could we have the next question, please? <Sync id=""L216""/>Couple of points here, Katy. <Sync id=""L217""/>Our iPhone ASP was $691 during the December quarter. <Sync id=""L218""/>We couldn't be happier with the level of ASP that we generated in the December quarter. <Sync id=""L219""/>Keep in mind that the foreign exchange impact on that number was $49.  <Sync id=""L220""/>So obviously, the mix of products was very strong. <Sync id=""L221""/>We had great reception for the new iPhones that we launched at the end of September. <Sync id=""L222""/>Of course, we have a very strong mid tier this year in the portfolio, with 6 and 6 Plus.  <Sync id=""L223""/>But overall,  when you look at the outcome during the December quarter, it was very, very strong.  <Sync id=""L224""/>So we feel very good about that and we feel that we have a very, very strong portfolio for iPhone. <Sync id=""L225""/>On the question around channel inventory, we entered the quarter, the December quarter -- and we mentioned it back in October -- below our target range of five to seven weeks. <Sync id=""L226""/>We have built a bit of inventory during the course of the December quarter.  <Sync id=""L227""/>But we have exited at the low end of the five to seven weeks, so we feel that we are in good shape there. <Sync id=""L228""/>And we've exited the quarter also on iPad and Mac well within the ranges that we want to have. <Sync id=""L234""/>Yes.  <Sync id=""L235""/>So that is kind of the ranking, Katy. <Sync id=""L236""/>It starts always for us with our tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and that is up a bit year-over-year. <Sync id=""L237""/>Then we've got data centers.  <Sync id=""L238""/>And data centers is a growing expenditure for us, because, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our installed base of customers ands devices is growing, and is growing very significantly.  <Sync id=""L239""/>And the data center capacity that we put in place is to provide the services that are tied to the installed base.  <Sync id=""L240""/>So that type of expenditure goes together with the installed base. <Sync id=""L241""/>And then around facilities, you probably know that we are nearing completion of our new campus here in Cupertino, and so this is the year where we've got our peak requirements in terms of capital. <Sync id=""L242""/>Thank you, Katy. <Sync id=""L243""/>Could we have the next question, please? <Sync id=""L253""/>Toni, we do think that iPhone units will decline in the quarter. <Sync id=""L254""/>We don't think that they will decline to the levels that you're talking about. <Sync id=""L255""/>We aren't projecting beyond the quarter, as Luca mentioned earlier; but at this point in time, we see that Q2 is the toughest compare. <Sync id=""L256""/>We believe it's the toughest compare because of the year ago quarter also had catch up in it from Q1. <Sync id=""L257""/>If you recall, we were heavily supply constrained throughout the whole of Q1, and so some of that demand moved into Q2.  <Sync id=""L258""/>Plus, we are in an environment now that is dramatically different from a macroeconomic point of view than last Q2, from a currency point of view, from the level of which we've had to adjust pricing in several of these markets, and the overall melees in virtually every country in the world.  <Sync id=""L259""/>And so it's really all of those factors that play in there and it's difficult to sort out how much is due to which one. <Sync id=""L262""/>The market itself, we don't spend a lot of time on predicting. <Sync id=""L263""/>Our view has always been that if we do -- if we make a great product and have a great experience,  that we ought to be able to convince enough people to move over.  <Sync id=""L264""/>And so as I look at maybe your broader umbrella point about a question on saturation, the metrics I see would strongly suggest otherwise. <Sync id=""L265""/>For example, almost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter were to people who were buying their first iPhone.  <Sync id=""L266""/>And certainly if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low -- in some cases, it's zero -- that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a tremendous number of people in the world, that will buy smartphones and we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those. <Sync id=""L275""/>Maybe I'm going to start with Services, Toni. <Sync id=""L276""/>The reason why we added this -- I think it's page 3 of our supplemental material -- is to try and explain that a couple of steps. <Sync id=""L277""/>The first one is that of the services that we report, there's a portion, about 85% of all of the services that we report is directly tied to the installed base. <Sync id=""L278""/>There is a smaller portion of our services business that is not related to installed base and more related to when we sell a device.  <Sync id=""L279""/>A perfect example would be an Apple Care agreement that you purchase at the time of the sale of the device. <Sync id=""L280""/>And then we are showing that on that portion of installed base-driven services business, there is a part that is related to -- where we recognize revenue in terms of the full transaction value.  <Sync id=""L281""/>And then there are transactions, like for example, App Store sales, where a portion of the transaction does not get recognized by Apple, but it goes to the developer. <Sync id=""L282""/>So when you look at it from a purchase value standpoint, actually in the December quarter, we grew 24%, and for the FY15, we grew at 23%. <Sync id=""L283""/>So we are growing at very, very healthy levels.  <Sync id=""L284""/>And to reconfirm the growth of the installed base, yes, it was over 25%. <Sync id=""L285""/>To the question around the channel inventory for iPhone, we grew channel inventory by 3.3 million units during the course of the December quarter.  <Sync id=""L286""/>Keep in mind, we started in acquisition where we were below our targeted range. <Sync id=""L287""/>We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter. <Sync id=""L289""/>Thank you, Toni.  <Sync id=""L290""/>Could we have the next question, please? <Sync id=""L299""/>Yes.  <Sync id=""L300""/>So Shannon, let me start with Q1. <Sync id=""L301""/>I think when you say IP licensing, you mean this patent dispute that was resolved. <Sync id=""L302""/>Yes, it was included in the gross margins.  <Sync id=""L303""/>And it was worth 40 basis points in the 40.1% that we reported for Q1. <Sync id=""L304""/>For the second quarter, the puts and takes are actually quite simple.  <Sync id=""L305""/>From an FX standpoint, the negative impact on a sequential basis from the December quarter is 50 basis points. <Sync id=""L306""/>Then of course, I would say by far the largest impact on margins for the quarter is the loss of leverage, because that's part of our seasonal pattern, which gets offset by a favorable commodity environment that we've seen for a number of quarters now.  <Sync id=""L307""/>And in a way, it's the other side of the coin of the foreign exchange situation. <Sync id=""L313""/>Yes, on the R&D, Shannon, we're continuing to invest without pause. <Sync id=""L314""/>We have some great things in the pipeline and we very much believe strongly in investing through downturns, such as the one that everyone is going through. <Sync id=""L315""/>In terms of SG&A, we obviously seek to throttle expenditures in SG&A to the business level, with the exception of where we're investing in new stores and, for example, our expansion plans in China have not changed. <Sync id=""L316""/>We are maintaining our investment profile and plans there. <Sync id=""L317""/>We are also continuing to invest in markets where we believe they are great places for Apple for the long term, like India, as an example of that one. <Sync id=""L318""/>And finally, even in the markets where today, grantedly, it looks fairly bleak, from Russia and Brazil and some of the other economies that are very much tied to our oil-based economies. <Sync id=""L319""/>We do believe that this, too, shall pass and that these countries will be great places and we want to serve customers in there, and so we're not retrenching. <Sync id=""L320""/>That's not -- we don't believe in that. <Sync id=""L321""/>We are fortunately strong enough to continue investing, and we think it's in Apple's best long-term interest to do so. <Sync id=""L322""/>Obviously, from a cost point of view, the downside of economic stress is that some asset prices get cheaper, commodity prices get cheaper, and that sort of thing.  <Sync id=""L323""/>And so I think this is exactly the period that you want to invest and do so confidently. <Sync id=""L325""/>Thank you, Shannon.  <Sync id=""L326""/>Could we have the next question, please? <Sync id=""L328""/>Steve, are you there? <Sync id=""L329""/>Steve? <Sync id=""L330""/>Let's go on to the next question, please. <Sync id=""L339""/>Brian, good question. <Sync id=""L340""/>In terms of China, the LTE penetration as of the end of last October, which is the last data I've got, was in the mid 20s.  <Sync id=""L341""/>And so there's an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are still running on 3G handsets. <Sync id=""L342""/>Also, I've talked about this before, but I think it's worth mentioning again, because it's easy to lose perspective with some of the things you read every day, is that the middle class in China was less than 50 million people in 2010, and by 2020, it's projected to be about half a billion.  <Sync id=""L343""/>And so there's just an enormous number of people moving into the middle class.  <Sync id=""L344""/>And we think this provides us a great opportunity to win over some of those customers into the Apple ecosystem. <Sync id=""L345""/>And so I think the demographics are great. <Sync id=""L346""/>We're continuing to invest in retail stores. <Sync id=""L347""/>Angela and her team have been on this very aggressive rollout plan. <Sync id=""L348""/>We now have 28 stores in Greater China and we are on target to have 40 in the summertime of this year.  <Sync id=""L349""/>And so we're continuing on distribution. <Sync id=""L350""/>Obviously, we've got product things in mind and are crafting our products and services with China heavily in mind. <Sync id=""L351""/>We remain very bullish on China and don't subscribe to the doom and gloom kind of predictions, frankly. <Sync id=""L352""/>In India, India is also incredibly exciting. <Sync id=""L353""/>India's growth, as you know, is very good. <Sync id=""L354""/>It's quickly becoming the fastest growing BRIC country. <Sync id=""L355""/>It's the third largest smartphone market in the world, behind China and the United States. <Sync id=""L356""/>The population of India is incredibly young. <Sync id=""L357""/>The median age there is 27. <Sync id=""L358""/>I think of the China age being young, at 36, 37.  <Sync id=""L359""/>And so 27 is unbelievable. <Sync id=""L360""/>Almost half the people in India are below 25.  <Sync id=""L361""/>And so I see the demographics there also being incredibly great for a consumer brand and for people that really want the best products. <Sync id=""L362""/>And as you know, we've been putting increasingly more energy in India. <Sync id=""L363""/>India revenue for us in Q1 was up 38%.  <Sync id=""L364""/>We also had currency issues in India, as everybody else did.   <Sync id=""L365""/>Constant currency growth was 48%.  <Sync id=""L366""/>And so it's a very rapidly expanding country.  <Sync id=""L367""/>And I think the government there is very interested economic reforms and so forth that I think all speak to a really good business environment for the future. <Sync id=""L371""/>Thank you, Brian.  <Sync id=""L372""/>Could we have the next question, please? <Sync id=""L382""/>Last question first. <Sync id=""L383""/>The number of people who had an iPhone prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus announcements -- and so this was in September of 2014 -- that have not yet upgraded to a 6, 6 Plus or 6s or 6s Plus is now 60%.  <Sync id=""L384""/>So another way to think about that is 40% have, 60% have not. <Sync id=""L385""/>In terms of your initial question about is there some of the compare issue that are people that ran out quickly to buy a 6 and 6 Plus and sort of accelerated?  <Sync id=""L386""/>There is no doubt that we had an unbelievable year last year, and the Q2 was particularly really, really strong because of the pent-up demand that left from Q1 in addition to Q2.  <Sync id=""L387""/>And so there's no doubt about that. <Sync id=""L388""/>However, I think you can tell from the numbers that Luca is talking about just on the currency side,  and that's before thinking through the affect that price increases can sometimes have on the business over a period of time, it's clear that the economic piece is large. <Sync id=""L390""/>Thank you, Kulbinder.  <Sync id=""L391""/>Could we have the next question, please? <Sync id=""L394""/>Steve, are you there? <Sync id=""L395""/>Okay.  <Sync id=""L396""/>Let's try the next question, please. <Sync id=""L406""/>So good question. <Sync id=""L407""/>We started breaking out Services, as you know, in the beginning of FY15.  <Sync id=""L408""/>And as that business has grown and as it became clear to us that the investors and analysts wanted more visibility into that business, we've now elected to break it out and show the full size, scope, growth, and make comments on the profitability of it from a transparency point of view. <Sync id=""L409""/>I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge, and I do think that it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on. <Sync id=""L410""/>In terms of our future plans, I wouldn't want to comment about any particular thing, but obviously, with breaking this out, we wouldn't be breaking it out if it wasn't an area that was very important to us in the future. <Sync id=""L417""/>Honestly, this has nothing to do with wanting to move customers from one person to another. <Sync id=""L418""/>This has to do with wanting to provide customers a very simple way to upgrade.  <Sync id=""L419""/>Because we serve a significant number of customers in the Apple Store who want the iPhone when it's new and when it comes out, and so we've designed a program that made it simple and easy to do that. <Sync id=""L420""/>I have no idea over time how the percentage of the sales will vary between carriers and the Apple retail store, but that's not our overriding objective. <Sync id=""L424""/>Thank you, Mark.  <Sync id=""L425""/>We have time for one more question. <Sync id=""L439""/>Our strategy is always to make the best products.  <Sync id=""L440""/>And that, for the smartphone market, that we are able to provide, though, several different price points for our customers. <Sync id=""L441""/>We have the premium part of our line is the 6s and the 6s Plus.  <Sync id=""L442""/>We also have a mid price point, with the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus.  <Sync id=""L443""/>And we continue to offer the iPhone 5s in the market and it continues to do quite well.  <Sync id=""L444""/>And so we offer all of those, and I don't see us deviating from that approach. <Sync id=""L445""/>We always want to offer somebody the -- we don't design to a certain price point.  <Sync id=""L446""/>We design a great product and we make it priced at a great value.  <Sync id=""L447""/>And today, we're able to offer all three of those different iPhone options. <Sync id=""L448""/>And Jim, on the patent question, yes, obviously this is a one-off item that affected the December quarter. <Sync id=""L449""/>As I said earlier, it's worth 40 basis points.  <Sync id=""L450""/>So without it, our gross margin would have been 39.7%.  <Sync id=""L451""/>It will not repeat going forward. <Sync id=""L452""/>To your question around was it included in the guidance, yes, the probability of receiving the amount was incorporated in the development of the guidance range. <Sync id=""L453""/>If you remember, we guided to 39% to 40%, and that number was included within the range. <Sync id=""L455""/>Thank you, Jim. <Sync id=""L456""/>A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks, podcast on the iTunes store, webcast on Apple.com/Investor, and via telephone.  <Sync id=""L457""/>And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and please enter confirmation code 7349088. <Sync id=""L458""/>These replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today.  <Sync id=""L459""/>And members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huget at 408-974-2414.  <Sync id=""L460""/>Financial analysts can contact Joan Hooper or me with additional questions.  <Sync id=""L461""/>Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I'm at 408-974-5420. <Sync id=""L462""/>Thanks again for joining us.","<Sync id=""L166""/>Hello.  <Sync id=""L167""/>Thank you very much. <Sync id=""L168""/>Just in terms of your March quarter guidance, it does imply a double digit decline at the midpoint. <Sync id=""L169""/>Maybe if you can just clarify, first of all, what FX headwind is embedded in that? <Sync id=""L170""/>And then just going to the fundamental underpinning reasons for that, how much of it do you think has to do with international markets in terms of weakening demand and how much of that do you think is comps versus any other factors you might identify, such as a response to higher prices for the iPhone in certain overseas markets? <Sync id=""L184""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L188""/>Good afternoon.  <Sync id=""L189""/>Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone upgrade program and the theme of iPhone as a subscription?  <Sync id=""L190""/>In particular, do you believe that this could have a measurable impact on the December quarter once we anniversary this? <Sync id=""L191""/>And then any thoughts on rolled outside the US when that program would. <Sync id=""L192""/>And my follow-up question would be, I know you can't talk about new products, but any high level thoughts on the virtual reality theme.  <Sync id=""L193""/>Do you think this is more of a geeky niche or something that could go mainstream? <Sync id=""L203""/>And then virtual reality? <Sync id=""L207""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L210""/>Yes, thanks. <Sync id=""L211""/>I appreciate the macro comments as it relates to guidance, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking consumers might react from an ASP perspective? <Sync id=""L212""/>Do you expect consumers to move down the product line, given the macro environment? <Sync id=""L213""/>And then also, how is channel inventory influencing guidance?  <Sync id=""L214""/>Do you feel like channel inventory needs to come down, given the demand trends?  <Sync id=""L215""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L229""/>And then as a follow-up, back in October you guided FY16 CapEx up over 30%. <Sync id=""L230""/>What's driving that growth? <Sync id=""L231""/>Can you rank it between equipment purchases, data center and real estate?  <Sync id=""L232""/>And given the slowdown that you started to see in December, are you still comfortable with that level of investment growth? <Sync id=""L233""/>Thanks. <Sync id=""L245""/>Yes.  <Sync id=""L246""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L247""/>I have a question, a follow-up, please. <Sync id=""L248""/>To start, just on iPhones, it looks like your guidance implies about a 15% to 20% unit decline in iPhones for fiscal Q2, which I think, unless you really see a change in demand profile in the second half, suggests that iPhone units will decline year-over-year for FY16. <Sync id=""L249""/>And I'd like you to address that question, because the obvious follow-up questions are is that because you believe the smartphone market won't grow or because Apple may be reaching saturation in the market? <Sync id=""L250""/>Is that because Apple's replacement cycle accelerated last year and is decelerating this year and that's why we'll see a decline in units? <Sync id=""L251""/>Or is there something about Apple's ability to gain share in a market where the market is moving to much lower price points?  <Sync id=""L252""/>But I'm wondering, and Tim, maybe you're best to answer it, if you can address what appears likely to be a decline in iPhone units and how we put that in the context of how we should think about that, given some healthy data around switchers that you highlighted. <Sync id=""L260""/>Right.  <Sync id=""L261""/>Can you speak to any of the points around your expectation for the smartphone market or whether you think your replacement cycle has changed or whether your ability to gain share has changed? <Sync id=""L267""/>Okay.  <Sync id=""L268""/>And I just have clarifications, I don't really have a follow-up question. <Sync id=""L269""/>Luca, you had talked about channel inventory increasing.  <Sync id=""L270""/>It was 18.4 million for iPhone last quarter.  <Sync id=""L271""/>Can you tell us how many more units you had this quarter? <Sync id=""L272""/>And then I'm not sure if I misheard you,  but I think you said your total installed base grew 25% year-over-year. <Sync id=""L273""/>Can you confirm that?  <Sync id=""L274""/>Because if Services grew at 13% and your installed base grew at 25%, it almost implies your penetration of your installed base, in terms of your ability to sell services, is going down. <Sync id=""L288""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L292""/>Thank you very much. <Sync id=""L293""/>I had a question about gross margin. <Sync id=""L294""/>Luca, you got gross margins of 39% to 39.5% in your guidance, and that includes hedging.  <Sync id=""L295""/>So I'm curious about the puts or takes in there. <Sync id=""L296""/>And then can you clarify if within the gross margin this quarter, that had the IP licensing contribution, as well?  <Sync id=""L297""/>Any color you can give, both on this quarter's gross margin puts and takes, and then also the March quarter.  <Sync id=""L298""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L308""/>Okay.  <Sync id=""L309""/>Thanks.  <Sync id=""L310""/>And then Tim, can you talk a bit about -- and I apologize, I sort of lost my voice here -- can you talk a bit about leverage within the model? <Sync id=""L311""/>I know you said you want to invest while there's great opportunity in China and all of that.  <Sync id=""L312""/>But given some of the pressures you're seeing, how do you think about where you spend that incremental SG&A dollar and that R&D dollar, and how should we think about it, given you're running $6 billion a quarter? <Sync id=""L324""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L332""/>Tim, could you talk a little bit about the next leg of growth in China?  <Sync id=""L333""/>Obviously, Apple's done a phenomenal job there.  <Sync id=""L334""/>But where do we see the next leg coming from? <Sync id=""L335""/>And also, you mentioned investing in India. <Sync id=""L336""/>Where do you see that over the next two to three years?  <Sync id=""L337""/>I think there's 1 billion mobile subscribers there, almost the size of China. <Sync id=""L338""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L368""/>Okay.  <Sync id=""L369""/>Great.  <Sync id=""L370""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L374""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L375""/>My question's for Tim on the iPhone business. <Sync id=""L376""/>You talk a lot about the macroeconomic weakness weighing on units, but is some of the issue just that last year replacement got accelerated and this year it's kind of normalizing, and that's kind of a one-time headwind in terms of the unit growth that you see in that business.  <Sync id=""L377""/>Is any of that going on,  or is that not material, in your view? <Sync id=""L378""/>And the other follow-up I had was that you've mentioned in recent calls, helpfully, the percent of the base, prior to when the 6 came out, that were now on the larger screen phones.  <Sync id=""L379""/>Can you give us an update on what that number is?  <Sync id=""L380""/>I think the last time it was in the low 30s.  <Sync id=""L381""/>Thanks. <Sync id=""L389""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L398""/>Yes.  <Sync id=""L399""/>Thank you.  <Sync id=""L400""/>Good afternoon. <Sync id=""L401""/>A question and a follow-up. <Sync id=""L402""/>As far as the question, Tim, I wanted to get a better sense from you in terms of what is the overarching message of introducing a little more details here around services. <Sync id=""L403""/>Is this really to just reinforce the power of the franchise or the platform at Apple in terms of to really navigate tougher macro times in terms of the higher level recurring revenue, or is it a stepping stone to much more in terms of Apple service, i.e. <Sync id=""L404""/>I think of all the stuff you do on the data center side.  <Sync id=""L405""/>Could we eventually have seen, with the help of IBM and Cisco, that you eventually move more into the cloud services for the enterprise? <Sync id=""L411""/>Okay.  <Sync id=""L412""/>Thank you.  <Sync id=""L413""/>And I wanted to follow-up on the upgrade advance program dynamics. <Sync id=""L414""/>Can you talk a little more about what you're seeing in terms of in-store at the Apple Stores? <Sync id=""L415""/>Are you seeing any sort of dislocation in terms of folks who are moving to the upgrade or finance program, are they moving more toward Apple versus maybe the in-store percentage that used to be related to the carriers?  <Sync id=""L416""/>In other words, are folks just going with Apple now, instead of the carriers, when they buy their phone, as part of these upgrade programs? <Sync id=""L421""/>Okay.  <Sync id=""L422""/>Thank you.  <Sync id=""L423""/>Good afternoon. <Sync id=""L427""/>Thank you very much.  <Sync id=""L428""/>A question for Tim and then a detail follow-up for Luca. <Sync id=""L429""/>Tim, with the macro situation changing, a lot of CEOs view that and their strategy is very different go-to-market strategy. <Sync id=""L430""/>Some change the way they go to market. <Sync id=""L431""/>Some change their products. <Sync id=""L432""/>In the past, Apple's been very known in always having a premium product.  <Sync id=""L433""/>With the slowdown in the macro FX and also GDP revision, is Apple's strategy go-to-market still always at premium product, or is there a need to go to more also a middle market or lower price point to attract more customers?  <Sync id=""L434""/>Just because it seems like growing that installed base and services, as you pointed out, really economically could really help out Apple in the long term. <Sync id=""L435""/>And then the financial question for Luca is on that patent litigation, Luca, when you gave guidance three months ago, did you have a view that that was coming in?  <Sync id=""L436""/>And if so, was that included in the guidance or not, or was that post the quarter guidance?  <Sync id=""L437""/>And I assume it's all one-time this quarter you recorded it, it's all gross margin, and we don't cause that to reoccur again going forward. <Sync id=""L438""/>Thank you very much. <Sync id=""L454""/>Thank you very much, gentlemen. information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.

However, we're constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property, and we have been buying companies on average every three to four weeks or so.  We continue to do that, and we think we've made some really great choices there. In terms of the investment in Didi, it was a unusual investment in that as you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these.  But, we have done some before. We invested in ARM in the early days. We invested in Akamai and a few other companies so it wasn't the first. From a Didi point of view, we see that as one, a great financial investment.  Two, we think that there's some strategic things that the Companies can do together over time. And, three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the business in the Chinese market even beyond what we currently know, and Didi has an incredible team there.  That's the rationale for why we did that. Would we do more investments? Yes, but it's not something that you'll see a whole string of from us, but we will constantly look for things that are smart to do. Yes, Shannon. Let me correct you, but it's 37.5% to 38%. For the September quarter.  So, it's essentially, we are guiding GM flat to slightly down sequentially. On the positive side, we are going to have leverage because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect to have positive mix as we get into the September quarter.  This positive is being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs which are typical of this time of the year for us. Shannon, on the commodity side and for the September quarter, we see NAND being pretty much in balance while DRAM and LCDs and other major commodities remain in an oversupply situation.  And so, overall commodity prices we expect to decline at, at least historical rates Thank you Shannon. Next question, please? Steve, we aren't going to get into products or product transitions.  However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter from Japan to Brazil to India. Some even stronger numbers than that in Russia.  So, there's a number of countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective. We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw. Our highest ever recorded, and the number of switchers through the nine months or the highest absolute numbers that we've ever had.  And so, when we look at that and then we look at the things going on in our other products and services, and we think services will continue to grow very briskly.  We've made our best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion. Well, we think to have a great platform you have to have a really healthy ecosystem, and so we're really proud of the developer community and the fact that developers are earning a lot more money in writing for iOS than other apps. We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that. We now have over 2 million apps in the app store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there's so many out there.  So, that's what we're doing. The TV and the -- you didn't mention CarPlay, but these are trying to provide our users a seamless experience across all of the different things that they do in their lives. And so, that's the rationale for CarPlay. It's the rationale for why we're putting huge investment in the home.  Making -- really bringing home automation to life for people in a very simple and elegant way. It's the reason for Apple TV and what we are doing in the living room.  All these things together are all about user experience and making people's daily lives better. Thank you, Steve. Next question, please? Well, Katy, I've talked about these elements at a broad level.  Of course, there are degrees of positive impact, right.  We, for example, on the mix front every cycle is slightly different on our product mix, and so that clearly has an impact on gross margin. The other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step back for a second and now we have gone through a couple of cycles where the US dollar has strengthened.  As you know, we work with our hedging program where we get protection from FX fluctuations in the short term, when these hedges roll off over time, we end up replacing them with new hedging contracts at the spot rate. And so, versus September of 2014, for example, the US dollar is now strengthened on average against international currencies by about 15%.  I think we need to accept and now we are living in this stronger US dollar environment.  We've taken a lot of actions on the cost side, on the pricing side, and obviously with hedges.  But, we need to deal with the situation, and that's where we are right now. We feel that 37.5% to 38% given the new FX environment, I think, says a lot about all the work that we've done on the cost side to get there.  Just to give you a sense on a year-over-year basis when I look at foreign exchange, that has an impact of almost 300 basis points on our margins. I don't want to talk about new phones that aren't announced.  And so that aside, what we have seen in the past tense or current tense on the upgrade rate is that the iPhone upgrade rate for the 6s is very similar to the 5s.  And, I guess in retrospect maybe that was a predictable thing although we didn't predict it at the beginning. It took a little time to realize that. The iPhone 6 was significantly higher than that, and so it likely accelerated upgrades that would have been in the current year ahead of those.  And so, what the future holds we'll see, but I'm very optimistic about the future because I see so many signs that are positive. I see an installed base that has gotten incredibly large. I see a switcher rate that is the highest ever. I see the Smartphone itself, lead by iPhone, becoming even more instrumental and important to peoples lives. It's becoming essential, and all of the things that are coming both in the fall.  The things that we've announced that you can see with iOS 10 hopefully you're running by now with the beta and other things make it even more instrumental and AI even makes it more and more. As the phone becomes more and more your assistant, it's one of those that you aren't going to leave without it. And so, I see all of those things as vectors that are incredibly positive. I also really like what I've seen with the iPhone SE, and the fact that it's opening the door to customers that we weren't reaching before and likely convincing some people to upgrade that wanted a smaller form factor but wanted to stay with iPhone.  And so, they were waiting for the iPhone SE. I see lots of positive things so that's how I look at it. Thank you, Katy.  Next question please? Toni, let me take it. Starting with your comments on the June quarter, just want to point out that when we talk about a $3.6 billion channel inventory reduction, that is not entirely related to iPhone. IPhone is the vast majority of that, but we did reduce channel inventory on all other products as well.  So, that probably leads you to different conclusions to the math that you just expressed. On the September quarter when I look at the sequential increase for iPhone units that we are expecting, I would say that it is even with the sell-through adjustment that you've talked about, it's still pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past. As you know, we do not provide guidance for channel inventory, but I would say in general, it's important to keep in mind that if we look around the world, we do see a lot of positive signs. But, we also know that the macroeconomic environment is slowing down in a number of places around the world, and that needs to be taken into account in our guidance. The iPhone demand is made up, as you know, of upgraders, switchers, and new to Smartphone.  And so, if you take it in the reverse order for a minute and look at the new to Smartphone, the penetration around -- Smartphone penetration right now around the world at the end of December was 42%.  So, there is quite a bit of room there. It is true that a lot of those are in emerging markets, but we have done -- we've had reasonable business success in several emerging markets.  So, we don't enter into those with no experience although we will enter into them humbly. On the switcher side, we really like what we're seeing, and we think that from a user point of view, as the Smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives which is a part of what I had talked about before.  A part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth. We think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying, and the thing that Apple does best which is provide this killer experience.  A killer user experience that's integrated across their lives, I think, becomes more important, and I think that really plays to our advantage. I also think that the deployment of AI technology is something that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience and so I like that. From an upgrade point of view, there are pluses and minuses as I see it. A plus is that more and more people have already joined upgrade programs. Some of these programs like the one that you referenced that we've done replaces the iPhone every year. There are also carriers that have similar kind of plans where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year. Others have an 18-month clock. Some have a 24-month clock, and there are even some that have a 30-month clock  So, there's various time schedules there.  As of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started and really got underway in a big way last year, in a smaller way two years ago.  We'll see more of those this coming fall. The minus side is that the bifurcation of the Smartphone from the service itself has a plus and a minus into it. The subsidy, the lack of that -- and this is more of a US phenomenon than the rest of the world.  Some of that can be a shock for people that we're used to paying $199 for their Smartphone and they come back in and pay less for the service but they pay more for their Smartphone. There's lots of pluses and minuses on this.  But, overall, as I look at this for Apple -- and this is not a statement on the industry itself -- but for Apple, I'm very optimistic. Thank you, Toni. Next question please? Yes, for books and movies, we currently have those stores off as you mentioned. To put this in some context, those two stores for the months that we have been operational, which is several months, the revenue was less than $1 million.  And so, it's not a revenue-related issue. From our point of view, this is a service we want to provide our customers.  So, we are working very closely with the appropriate government agencies, and we hope to make books and movies available again to our customers there.  We'll see how that goes, but we're optimistic there. I think we've always had a -- if you look at our share over time, our share in China tends to peak during launch windows. There's a higher high and a lower low there. There's a bigger difference between those two. What we have to do and what we are doing is innovating like crazy and delivering the best Smartphone to our customers there.  And, if we do a really great job of that, which we will, then I'm confident that we'll do well. Thank you. Next question, please? Yes, on the Apple pay side, the revenues from Apple pay are in the services line. The growth is astronomical, but the base is very small.  So, for today, Apple pay is very much about a great feature for our customers so that they can pay in a very simple, private, and secure way. In terms of AR and the Pokemon phenomenon, it's incredible what has happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative Apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of being a developer being able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world.  This certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of the pressure on their servers, et cetera, because of the demand. But, I'm sure that they will over time. It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there's great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity, and so we're investing and the number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers' kind of products like Pokemon.  That's the reason you see so many of the iPhones out in the wild right now chasing Pokemon. I know there's people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we will see. There's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform.  However, that said, I think AR can be huge. So, we'll see whether it's the next platform, but regardless, it will be huge. Thanks, Gene.  Next question, please? On the R&D growth, we do continue to invest significantly in R&D. The growth rates are still large on a year-over-year basis and Luca can share the exact ones, but I think the recent quarter was in the [mid-20s] for R&D. The balance of the Company, we're managing more flattish from a year-over-year point of view. The products that are in R&D -- there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping.  And so, I don't want to talk about the exact split of it, but you can look at the growth rate and conclude that there's a lot of stuff that we're doing beyond the current products. Mark, on the ASP question.  Talked about $595 in Q3.  It's down $65 on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind about $20 of that $65 is foreign exchange.  So, during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no SE units in channel inventory so we had to do at least a partial channel [sale] that obviously had an impact on ASPs.  And then, the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end. So, the combination of these two things, obviously, had an impact on ASPs.  But, I think as I said or Tim said during the prepared remarks, we do expect iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we move into the September quarter because these two factors that I just mentioned.  I'm not going to repeat. On cannibalization, of course, we've got limited experience because the phone has been in the market just for a few weeks.  But, when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the SE is doing exactly what it was intended which is we are seeing a higher rate of new-to-iPhone customers which is obviously very important to us as we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem.  And, we see a higher rate of previous iPhone owners that really prefer the four-inch phone factor. We have not seen clear evidence of cannibalization from iPhone 6s or 6s plus.  Of course, there's always going to be some level of cannibalization, but really to us what is much more relevant is the much bigger opportunity to bring more people into the iOS ecosystem. Thanks, Mark. Next question, please? On your question on iPhone ASP, I'm not sure if I understood it correctly.  But clearly, the iPhone SE has a downward impact on iPhone ASP, of course, because it comes at the low end of the range. From a gross margin perspective, it is slightly dilutive to Company margins, but the impact is not particularly large. On the Apple TV question.  The introduction of Apple TV and TV OS in last October and the subsequent OS releases and what's coming out this fall -- think of that as building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time. So, I don't want to be more precise than that, but you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of. Thank you for the question. Thank you, Kulbinder. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, the Webcast on www.Apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

Tim, can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on investments? You made the Didi investment this quarter. Obviously you continue to make acquisitions over time. We just saw -- you invested in buying some of the carpool karaoke. I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about where you're putting your investment dollars for more of an acquisition or a potential equity stake standpoint as you look at overall capital allocation? Great, thank you.  And then, just as a follow-up for Luca.  If you could talk a little bit about the gross margin puts and takes for guidance at 37% to 38%.  How are we thinking about commodity pricing and mix of the new products and that just as you look to how you guided gross margin? Oh, sorry.  I had that written down, but I said the wrong thing. Great.  Thank you very much. Regarding your revenue guidance for September, it's up about 10% sequentially which is clearly at the high end historically.  So, what can you tell us about the timing of the new iPhone model?  Is that affecting this?  You mentioned the 451 is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008. You've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low so it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment.  So, where is the strength coming from in the September quarter? Okay, fair enough.  As a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about your platform strategy.  You talk about the four operating systems essentially as platforms which I agree with.  And, it's just interesting to me because Apple has such control over the vertical integration of your products, and yet you've somehow been able to grasp the openness that's required for platforms. And, I think that's reflected in WWDC as you pointed out.  Opening up APIs and so forth on messaging, and you made the case there for Apps versus messaging and the anti-bot argument. Just curious is that the way -- am I characterizing this roughly correctly in term of how you think about the business?  And, how are you managing that internally in terms of having this vertically integrated somewhat closed view of the hardware and yet this pretty open platform where the value is created externally? Thank you. Thank you. Luca, as it relates to gross margin, the guidance today is very similar to what you've provided over the last five years in terms of gross margin guidance in September versus June.  And, the variances that you walked through in response to Shannon's questions are very similar to the dynamics that you see in any September quarter, but there's an added factor this time around which is you don't have the $4 million of high ASP, high margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June quarter. So, I guess I'd just pushback and ask why gross margin guidance wouldn't be even better?  Is it the more balanced NAND environment that Tim spoke to?  Or, is there something else impacting the guidance? Okay.  Thank you.  Tim, can you speak to how you envision the upgrade rate of the iPhone installed base to play out over the next quarter or the next year? Somebody mentioned that US carriers have reported really weak upgrade rates, not necessarily for iPhone but across their installed base.  The press is discussing only modest technology upgrades in your next iPhone cycle. So, those data points would lead investors to believe that the upgrade rate will be low.  But, curious if you have a different view?  Thank you. Yes, thank you. You commented about the significant inventory drawdown in the quarter -- $3.6 billion on the revenue side.  So, sell-through was $46 billion effectively. Over 4 million iPhones, suggesting that sell-through iPhone sales were $45 million. When I look to your guidance for Q4, I actually have the opposite question of a previous question which is in light of the true sell-through rate which seems to reflect better than normal seasonality in Q3.  Likely some contribution and elasticity from the SE.  When I look at Q4, it looks like you're guiding for iPhone unit on a sell-through basis to be flat or potentially down? And, for total Company revenues to be only fractionally up and below the kind of seasonality we see in Q4. So, I guess my question is are you expecting any drawdowns in channel inventory in fiscal Q4?  Or, are my inferences around sell-through rate incorrect? Or, given the business momentum that you spoke about in response to an earlier question and the hopefulness that you expressed in your prepared remarks, Tim.  I'm actually surprised the guidance isn't a bit stronger on the top line. Luca, I did understand the $3.6 billion, but you said over 4 million iPhones were drawn down. I added that to the $40.4 million so that would suggest close to $45 million on a sell-through basis, so that was the basis for my observation. I was wondering if we could, if I could direct one at Tim. You talked about the upgrade cycle and how it  is elongated relative to the iPhone 6, and that it's similar to what you saw with the 5s. My belief is that one of the bigger longer term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just structurally elongate over time particularly as your installed base of customers becomes less affluent and more international.  So, I guess my question is you have a mechanism which is the Apple upgrade program which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and puts people on buying the phone as a service. I'd welcome any comments on how that program is doing?  And then, just more broadly, is Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its products on a monthly-type subscription basis perhaps in a more bundled fashion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model? Thank you. Tim, as you mentioned, you traveled to China during the quarter.  While you certainly sound encouraged on China and highlighted the Didi investment, there are some of the key services for Apple like iBooks and iTunes, movies that are still banned, and some of the local vendors appear to be gaining share. So, can you just give us your perspective on the market?  Your expectations around getting those services back up and also regaining share? And, in terms of just regaining share in the market more broadly? Good afternoon,  Tim, you gave some nice data points around Apple Pay. Can you remind us is this a business that ultimately impacts the services line in any measurable way?  Or, is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones? And, separately is that, when you just take a step back and look at the proof point that augmented reality theme has had with this whole Pokemon phenomenon.  How does it impact how you think about the future? I assume you think about it. I'm curious what goes on in your mind when you see all of that?  Thanks. Would you say there's going to be a computing shift to AR longer term? Thank you. Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Just want to follow-up, Tim, if I could related to the R&D pace of growth. Clearly, a lot of momentum there over the last couple of years, but we're just trying to figure out how much of that is dedicated to existing products and services versus what's next?  And, can you give us a sense in terms of when investors should think about the ROI coming back to them from the R&D perspective?  And, corollary to that, does that -- is it really restricted just to products and services currently? Or, can we see more of a cloud services apparatus evolve over time where you do more and more in the Enterprise just given the core chips with SAP and Cisco and IBM?  And then, my follow-up for Luca is around ASPs for the iPhone. We keep getting a lot of questions around SE in terms of how cannibalistic could it be to the core iPhone franchise?  Are you seeing any moderation in terms of the ASP pressures there? Thanks.  Just a couple of questions. Luca, I want to clarify that last point on ASPs and iPhone? In the last quarter, it seemed that you were quite clear that was a negative driver to the gross margin of the Company.  So, I understand there is other drivers going into the September quarter, but just to be clear, the 4 million or so units that you didn't sell-through that were depleted out of channel inventory, those are relatively high gross margin as well.  That's just a clarification. And then, for Tim, on the services side.  As Apple has spoken more and more loudly I guess over the last three or four quarters, I just think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how its still been in the '60s and '70s and the experience hasn't changed.  I understand you have the Apple TV box out, but in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something that Apple wants to do themselves? Do you want to partner?  Could you even build content?  How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity as opposed to here is an Apple box and we sell some units, but it's not that meaningful to the overall Company in terms of size.  I'm just curious given the installed base and users you have?   Many thanks. Okay. Okay, thank you. information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.

But, from a worldwide point of view, the truth is that demand is outstripping supply in the vast majority of places, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus. And so, it's -- we're in a situation at the moment, it's difficult in the early weeks to be able to differentiate. But, on an anecdotal basis, it's clear the upgrade programs are a win. I can't speak about rumors, but as you know, we look for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products, and we're always looking at new things.  The car space, in general, is an area that it's clear that there's a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience. So, it's interesting from that point of view, but certainly nothing to announce today. It's hard to say. I believe that on iPhone 7, we will. On iPhone 7 Plus, I'm not sure. I wouldn't say yes at this point because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products, but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch. Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please. Sure. Let me say a few things on the 14th week and revenue outlook for the December quarter. Keep in mind that the December quarter a year ago for us was an all-time quarterly revenue record. We think we can grow this year. As Tim said, the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is very strong. The strength of our services business, you've seen we've grown 24% in September. We think we can continue to grow very well into the December quarter. You mentioned the 14th week and the few extra days do help us this quarter, but I think it's important to keep in mind that there are other factors that go and offset these extra few days. As you know, the launch timing of the new iPhone is different this year. We had the first nine days of sales this year hit Q4. There were only two days last year. So, the cadence has moved more towards Q4 this year versus Q1 last year. As you know, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units in the first quarter of 2016. As Tim said, we are very supply-constrained on iPhone 7 Plus this year. We are simply more supply-constrained this year than we were a year ago. And then, keep in mind there were a couple of things that affected compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year.  And, also, the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter. So, I hope that gives you a bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter. There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market. And so, that's a part of it. We feel really great about the things that we've got. We've also put a lot of emphasis on our services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better. And so, we're very much -- we're confidently investing in the future, and that's the reason you see the R&D spend increasing. Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please. It's a good question, Shannon. So, to back up from our results for the quarter, the 90-day clock and look at the full year of 2016.  We were down 17% compared to the FY15 which was up 84% from the previous year. So, if you look at 2014 to 2016, the revenue grew 52%, and the CAGR was 23% which really are pretty good results. Also, as you probably know, the FY16 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 3%. So, the underlying business performance was 14% down.  And so, why was it down? There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world. And so, when that upgrade rate in FY16 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5S [as a point], it had further to fall. So, that's the main reason in our view that you see a difference. Now, that spun or created another issue for us because we didn't forecast that accurately. So, in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it. So, those two issues, which really the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are in our views the main issue. Now, looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive. It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making. And so, we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter which obviously feels very good for us. And, from a longer term point of view, out of the 90-day clocks and so forth, we are very bullish on China. We continue to see a middle class that is booming there. There might be some sort of a new normal in the economy, but a new normal there is still a good growth rate. And so, with the number of middle class -- people growing into the middle class and the LTE adoption rate being still fairly low, around 45%, 50% or so, then I think we continue to have a really good opportunity there. And so, we continue to focus significantly in China. We're open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more. And so, we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not. But, we're definitely open, and we definitely look. Yes. Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please. Toni, let me take this one. I think you mentioned a number of the things that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went through them with Katy just a few minutes ago. You're right.  We've got an extra few days. You know very well the launch timing is different. You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago. I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now. But, maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply-constrained on 7 and 7 Plus. And so, when you talk about other competitors, it's not particularly relevant to us right now because we are selling everything that we can produce. And so, when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that for the total Company, of course, we believe that revenue is going to grow.  You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance. And so, we feel very confident about the trajectory for the Company and for iPhone going forward. I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. In terms of owning content and creating content, we have started with focusing on some original content as you point out. We've got a few things going there that we talked about. And, I think it's a great opportunity for us, both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. And so, it is an area that we're focused on. Thank you, Toni.  Could we have the next question, please. Simona, the installed base number is something that we talk about periodically. Last time we talked about it was in the January call. It is growing. Our installed base is growing very well which is very important for us. It's growing on all major products, and it's growing, of course, in total. When you look at our services revenue, the growth of the services revenues has been accelerating during the course of the year. During a period when, as you know, our revenue came down slightly. So, what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services, over time, they tend to spend more and more on our services. We've got customers who are very engaged with our products. They're very loyal, and so you see this upward trajectory of our services business. It's not only with the App store but several categories that are growing very well for us. Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we've got other parts of the business that continue to do well. Even as I said, during a period of time when our sales have come down a bit. I think that, to answer your second question first, I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time. And, we live in a mobile society. People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that they may be doing. And so, the advantage of having an assistant on your phone is it's with you all the time. That doesn't say that there's not a nice market for a home one. I'm not making that point. I'm just saying on a balanced point of view I think the usage of one on the phone will likely be much greater. In fact, you can just look at Siri today, and this is now accelerating with iOS 10 and the Mac. But, we've been getting 2 billion requests a week for Siri. And so, it's very large, and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more assisted, enabled devices than probably anyone out there. Our focus is on this worldwide. And so, it's not only a US focus, but we want to deliver a great experience around the world and deliver globally.  So, we've put a lot of the energy into doing that. In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long conversation.  But, at a high level, I think it's a false tradeoff that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you. We don't buy that. It may take a different kind of work. It might take more thinking. But, I don't think we should throw our privacy away. It's like the age-old argument about privacy versus security. We should have both. It shouldn't be making a choice. And so, that at a high level is how we see it. Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please. Steve, you mentioned by far the largest driver. The largest driver is the fact that we made the change, an accounting change to our ESPs exactly a year ago. So, we are lapping the year where you see the effect. I think you're not going to see the same thing going forward. And then, we tend to defer some revenue on some other categories like, for example, gift cards or some AppleCare. But, in general, by far the largest element is the change in ESPs. I don't think you're going to see the same impact going forward. We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had, and we're really confident about the things in it. But, as usual, we're not going to talk about what's in it. We have a strong sense of where things go, and we're very agile to shift as we need to. Thanks, Steve. Can we are have the next question, please. With the iPhone 7 Plus, we've put an incredible amount of innovation into the camera and the overall photo experience, and customers are obviously using that and have discovered that they love it. So, we're getting an incredible amount of feedback there. We also get incredible feedback on the iPhone 7. But, the mix that we projected on an iPhone 7 Plus is short of what the reality is. So, we are chasing supply there. In terms of the ASP, the way we think about it is we want to charge a fair price. And so, we don't want to charge more than that, and we think it's worth being fair. And so, that's how we look at it. If I can add, Wamsi, keep in mind that in a lot of countries around the world the reality is that our customers have seen some significant price increases because of the FX situation, right. And, that's something that we need to keep in mind as well. We clearly saw that this year. There's a lot of competition for customers in the US which I think is the market that you're talking about. Whether that will happen every two years, I don't know. But, I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two-year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers. Thank you. Thank you. Can we have the next question, please. Thanks for the question. I'll let Luca talk about the OpEx piece of it. On India, I think it's important to look not only at per-capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class over the next decade. And, the age of the population, if you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 25. So, you have a very, very young population. The smartphone has not done as well in India in general. However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there. But, this year, or this year and next year, there are enormous investments going in on 4G, and we couldn't be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iPhones to produce that great experience for people. And so, I see a lot of the factors moving in the right direction there. I also think the government is much more focused on the infrastructure and on creating jobs, which is fantastic, because you really need the infrastructure and the technology to do that. Will it be as big as China? I think it's clear that the population of India will exceed China sometime in the -- probably the next decade or so, maybe less than that. I think it will take longer for the GDP to rival it. But, that's not critical for us to have a great success there. The truth is, there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone. And, I think we can compete well for some percentage of those.  And, given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there's a lot of headroom there in our mind. And so, we're working very hard to realize that opportunity. And, Jim, on OpEx, our approach to OpEx is quite clear and quite simple. We want to continue to invest in the business in all the areas where we think it's critical for us to invest. So, you see that we make significant investments in R&D. You've seen the growth rates over the last couple of years. We are making important investments in data centers because we want to support our services business. We continue to open retail stores around the world. We continue to invest in marketing and advertising. At the same time, we want to continue to be efficient and lean. It's something that we've done very well over the years. We want to continue to do that. So, what you've seen, for example, in FY16, you've seen investments in R&D growing at 25% and then our SG&A expenses to be about flat. This is kind of the approach that we want to take and continue to take going forward. If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance for the December quarter, we've got an expense-to-revenue ratio of 9%. This is extremely competitive in our industry, and I would I say in general. So, we want to continue to have this balance. Make the right investments and remain efficient. Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question, please. Rod, let me give you some details both on a sequential basis, and I'll give you also something on a year-over-year basis because maybe that's where the disconnect comes from looking at last year's gross margins in the December quarter. On a sequential basis, we're essentially guiding to some improvement in gross margins. We had 38% both in the June quarter and in the September quarter. We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because on the positive we're going to have, of course, better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. But, we need to keep into account the fact that these positives are going to be partially offset by the cost structures of the new products that we are launching now, and we launched already a few during the September quarter and that will have an impact on our December-quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, keep in mind that last year we did in Q1 we did 40%, around 40%, 41%.  But, there's a couple of things that I think need to be considered before doing a year-over-year compare. And, it's a fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million that is at the gross margin level is 40 Bps. And then, we've got the FX situation which I mentioned before which is worth another 60, 70 Bps. And so, you're left with less than 100 basis points deterioration on a year-over-year basis where, again, we have the reality of new cost structures into our products. It is very, very important, I think, for investors to understand that what's happened during the last two years. During the last two years the US dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business. And, we are a Company that generates two-thirds of our revenues outside the United States. 15% appreciation of the US dollar. So, on a year-over-year basis, just 2016 over 2015, was 340 Bps impact from foreign exchange. This is something that we have offset almost entirely through a number of initiatives going from pricing actions to cost initiatives to our hedging program.  But, at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new normal, and we need to work with that.  And, I think over the years, we have made very good tradeoffs, and our gross margins have been quite stable over time. We review the capital return annually, and we've established a cadence now to announce our thinking on that every April. So, we have a robust discussion around the dividend and the buyback. We very much believe that Apple is very undervalued, and so we're investing with confidence in the Company that we know really well. And so, that thinking has I think proven out over time, and I think been very good for our shareholders. And, in addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and some ongoing income, and so we provided an amount that we think is a good amount and have a good track record of raising it annually. And so, we'll be able to say more on that I'm sure in April of next year.

Tim, now that we're a month in the iPhone 7, are you seeing anything measurable in terms of the growing trend of annual upgrades?   Second is, historically in terms of new product categories, you have always looked for you unique advantage before getting into a segment.  And, I'm curious about the car. There are a lot of rumors out there and would like your perspective on how you think about an advantage that Apple could add in the auto space? Just one quick follow-up in terms of the supply. Do you think we'll be at equilibrium by the end of the quarter, for iPhone supply? Thank you. Thanks. Good afternoon.  Luca, can you help us understand what's embedded in revenue guidance for the extra week as well as any rebuilding of channel inventory, given all the major products are running below target. Just trying to get at whether you see revenue, and in particular, iPhone growth year on year on more of a sell-out basis when you adjust for those two factors. And then, I have a follow-up. That's great color. Thank you for that. Follow-up for Tim. What should we read into the fact that R&D has more than doubled over the past three years, while sales growth was one-fifth of that. Are R&D investments just less efficient than they were in the Company's history?  Or, should we think about that as incremental spend for products that haven't yet come to market? Thank you. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit more about China?  Just how you're thinking about it?  Where you're seeing pressure? I know you mentioned that you expect to see a significant rebound during the first quarter.  But, what are your customers telling you about the demand in China? Great. Thank you. And then, can you talk a bit about acquisitions. I don't mean like the smaller ones that you've done at a normal cadence, but there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world.  And, especially if you find a way to have [cash] repatriation of some of the cash at a low tax rate possibly with the next administration.  So, just if you can give an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a little bit larger than normal? Thank you. Yes, thank you. I have a question and a follow-up, please. I guess a cynic could say Apple is benefiting from an extra week this quarter and is benefiting from Samsung being in complete disarray.  And yet, from your guidance, it's unclear that iPhone unit growth will be up or certainly not up more than low single digits implied from your guidance. And, I appreciate some of the issues around channel inventory build and the timing of the launch. But, if I just stand back from that and say you have terrific new products.  Your major competitor is laying down.  You have an enormous -- you have a significant contribution from an extra week, arguably, 7% or 8%, and yet the iPhone growth is sort of flattish.  What does that really say about how investors should think about iPhone on a sustained basis growing forward?  And, is it reasonable to think that this is an ongoing, growing business for the Company? Tim, if I could ask you one, please. You've talked in the past about television being an area of intense interest. I was wondering if you could reaffirm that statement? Is that still the case? And then, additionally, given what's happening with acquisitions, how broadly you think about the role of content?  Apple has started creating on a very limited scale some of its own content, and whether you think content creation and ownership is important to Apple?  Or, whether Apple ultimately sees its place in the value chain as being more around ecosystem and distribution? Thank you. I have a question for Luca, and then one for Tim as well. Luca, I wanted to dig into the services business a bit more. As you pointed out, it accelerated again to 24%. How does that compare to the pace of growth of the installed base, just to help us decouple how much of it is consumption-driven on a per-user basis versus the base as a whole? Thank you. And then, Tim, we've seen an increasing focus on artificial intelligence both in smartphones like the new Pixel from Google, but also in some of the home assistants like the Amazon Echo.  And, you have obviously had Siri for a while as well. But, I just am curious how you think about balancing AI with your focus on privacy. Also, how important it is to have a dedicated home assistant versus just having the phone as the home assistant? Thank you. Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted to ask you about the total deferred revenue, which was down about $1.3 billion in June, and down I think another $400 million in September. Those are rather large declines even given the fact that your units are coming down, and you had the accounting change back in September. Could you talk about some of the drivers of that, and what you might expect going forward? Okay. Thank you. And then Tim, some investors are antsy that Apple has not acquired new profit pools or introduced a financially material new product in recent years. The question is, A, does Apple today have a grand strategy for what you want to do?  I know you won't tell us what it is. But, do you know what you want to do over the next three to maybe five years?  Or, is it more a read the market and quickly react? B, do you have any sense, we're kind of in a gap period where the technology and arguably what we've called the next job to be done haven't yet aligned?  So, maybe in a couple years, we will see this flurry of new products, and it will sort of match what people want to do but it's not quite here yet? But, in terms of your approach, I guess, to new products.  Do you have a strong sense of where technology is going?  Where you're going to play?  Or, is it still enough up in the air that you're willing to react fairly quickly which arguably your organization allows you to do for the size of the Company you are. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So, Tim and Luca, you saw that you could raise the ASP on the iPhone 7 Plus by $20, and you're completely sold out. So, clearly this device plays a central role in our lives, so much that owners probably look at that incremental cost as a great tradeoff to get the best device out there. As you see more and more features being added into iPhones, do you conceptually expect that you're anywhere close to the point where raising ASPs further would be net-disruptive to demand?  Or, do you see more room to raise ASPs over time as you add incremental features.  And, I have a follow-up. Great. Thanks for the clarification. And, Tim, this year, we saw carrier incentives come back to force, post the launch of the iPhone 7, 7 Plus.  Two years ago, there was a giant upgrade cycle from the iPhone 6, 6 Plus. Do you think every couple of years we are likely to see carrier incentives come back into play given worries around customer churn?  Thereby, making the phone even more affordable?  Thanks. Thanks, Tim. Thank you very much. A strategy question for Tim and then more of a financial question for Luca. Tim, you had mentioned in your prepared comments a little bit about India, and we've been doing a lot of work talking about the opportunities in India. And, we get a lot of pushback talking about disposable income metrics and lots of things like that, yet the population being so large. Can you talk a little about, do you see that India could at some point be as [big] of an opportunity as China, and it appears that the legal rules have prevented you from going in a lot.  But, it looks like that's changing. Can you give us a little more clarity on India? And then, Tim, for the clarification questions.  Is it fair to say that the OpEx has a disproportionate more expense side with the 14th week that we should think of maybe as we go forward, that we shouldn't expect the OpEx to be chugging along at that high rate?  Or, is it just kind of the rate of investing that you're going?  Thank you very much, gentlemen. Thank you and congratulations, and thanks for the details, gentlemen. Hi.   Thanks for the question. I had one for Luca and then a follow-up for Tim. So, Luca, I wanted to ask about the gross margin guidance?  I think that the Street and we were expecting something a little bit higher, and I guess that's about 50 basis points lower.  The Street -- it was 70 basis points lower. I'm just curious, do you think that people are mis-modeling that?  Or, is there something going on with pricing or mix there that you could provide us more color on? That's my first question. Okay. Great. Thanks, Luca. And then, Tim, I wanted to ask you, this question comes up once in a while.  But, I just wanted to ask you if you could talk to us a little bit about the arguments on both sides of the dividend question. Apple seems to be perpetually undervalued. It's a very large Company.  It is getting harder and harder to grow. Your payout ratio is significantly below the S&P 500. I know you can't tell us what your intentions are here, but if you could help us understand how that thinking around the dividend works it would be great.

sequentially from 38.5% that we just reported, typically, we have product transition costs during the September quarter. <Sync id=""L158""time=""00:25:43""/>That's the primary driver. <Sync id=""L159""time=""00:25:46""/>This happens fairly regularly for us. <Sync id=""L160""time=""00:25:48""/>We also have a more difficult memory pricing environment this year than a year ago. <Sync id=""L161""time=""00:25:54""/>And we think that we're going to be able to partially offset this with a positive leverage. <Sync id=""L162""time=""00:25:59""/>As you've seen, we've guided up sequentially in revenue. <Sync id=""L163""time=""00:26:04""/>So those are the major puts and takes. <Sync id=""L164""time=""00:26:11""/>In terms of the range that we use for gross margins, we have a fairly good understanding on where we are with our hedging program, and that allows us to mitigate some of the volatility there. <Sync id=""L165""time=""00:26:25""/>So we felt we could guide to a slightly narrowed range, which we've done occasionally in the past. <Sync id=""L169""time=""00:27:21""/>Katy, as Luca mentioned, we did assume some transitional costs in our guidance for the quarter as is typically the case. <Sync id=""L170""time=""00:27:35""/>And we're looking very much forward to the product rollouts. <Sync id=""L175""time=""00:28:18""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L176""time=""00:28:19""/>Thanks, Shannon. <Sync id=""L177""time=""00:28:21""/>We were very encouraged by the results this quarter. <Sync id=""L178""time=""00:28:25""/>We improved, as we thought we would, from the previous quarters a little more than I thought we would. <Sync id=""L179""time=""00:28:35""/>If you look underneath the numbers, Mainland China was actually flat year-over-year during Q3. <Sync id=""L180""time=""00:28:45""/>And in constant-currency terms, we were actually up 6% in Mainland China. <Sync id=""L181""time=""00:28:52""/>And so we're very encouraged by that. <Sync id=""L182""time=""00:28:56""/>iPad grew dramatically more than the market. <Sync id=""L183""time=""00:29:01""/>The Mac grew much more than the market. <Sync id=""L184""time=""00:29:06""/>iPhone was relatively flat year-on-year as the same sort of -- similar as the market was. <Sync id=""L185""time=""00:29:15""/>And so we see all of those as very encouraging signs. <Sync id=""L186""time=""00:29:19""/>On top of that, Services grew extremely strongly during the quarter. <Sync id=""L187""time=""00:29:28""/>The -- Hong Kong continued to drag down the total Greater China segment. <Sync id=""L188""time=""00:29:36""/>And -- but on a sequential basis, we're probably sort of at the trough of that, which is nice. <Sync id=""L189""time=""00:29:50""/>With the peg to the dollar there, from a currency point of view and tourism being what it is, I don't really know when that market will come back. <Sync id=""L190""time=""00:29:59""/>But what I -- what we see in the mainland is definitely much more encouraging. <Sync id=""L191""time=""00:30:08""/>It's interesting to note that upgraders through -- both for the quarter and actually for the full fiscal year to date was our highest ever. <Sync id=""L192""time=""00:30:22""/>And so that we felt very good about. <Sync id=""L193""time=""00:30:28""/>In terms of WeChat, the way that I look at this is because our share -- because iOS share is not nearly a majority of the market in China, the fact that a lot of people use that, it makes the switching opportunity even greater. <Sync id=""L194""time=""00:30:52""/>And I think that's more the case than the risk that a lot of folks have pointed out. <Sync id=""L195""time=""00:31:00""/>And so I see Tencent as one of our biggest and best developers. <Sync id=""L196""time=""00:31:07""/>They've done a great job of implementing a lot of iOS features in their apps. <Sync id=""L197""time=""00:31:12""/>And we're looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China. <Sync id=""L204""time=""00:31:45""/>The -- from an absolute quantity point of view, the upgrades for this fiscal year are the highest that we've seen and so we feel good about that. <Sync id=""L205""time=""00:32:02""/>However, if you look at it from an upgrade rate point of view instead of the absolute number, the rate is similar to what we saw with the previous iPhones, except for iPhone 6, which as we've called out in the past, had an abnormally high upgrade rate. <Sync id=""L206""time=""00:32:25""/>We do think that based on the amount of rumors and the volume of them, that there's some pause in our current numbers. <Sync id=""L207""time=""00:32:38""/>And so where that affects us in the short term, even though we had great results, it probably bodes well later on. <Sync id=""L210""time=""00:33:05""/>Sure. <Sync id=""L211""time=""00:33:06""/>Switching outside of China was up year-on-year and so we're happy with that. <Sync id=""L212""time=""00:33:14""/>We continue to see people moving over to iOS, and it helped with us making the results that Luca announced earlier, including the channel inventory reduction. <Sync id=""L218""time=""00:34:02""/>Sure. <Sync id=""L219""time=""00:34:03""/>Starting with the U.S. -- and let me just take this question from what are we doing to increase jobs, which I think is probably where it's rooted. <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:34:16""/>There's -- we've created 2 million jobs in the U.S. and we're incredibly proud of that. <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:34:22""/>We do view that we have a responsibility in the U.S. to increase economic activity, including increasing jobs because Apple could have only been created here. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:34:36""/>And so as we look at that 2 million, there are 3 main categories of that, and we have actions going on in each of them to further build on that momentum. <Sync id=""L223""time=""00:34:49""/>The first category is app development, about 3/4 of the 2 million are app developers. <Sync id=""L224""time=""00:34:55""/>And we're doing an enormous amount of things to deliver curriculum to both K-12 with Swift Playgrounds and the K-6 area; other curriculum, as you proceed beyond Grade 6, under the Everyone Can Code area. <Sync id=""L225""time=""00:35:17""/>And just a couple of months ago, we announced a new curriculum that's focused on community schools and community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges for kids that did not have coding in their elementary and high school years. <Sync id=""L226""time=""00:35:38""/>And so we're excited about that because we think it could increase the diversity of the developer community and the quantity. <Sync id=""L227""time=""00:35:46""/>And I think this area, in general and all the things we do for the developer community, will be the largest contribution that Apple can make because this is the fastest-growing job segment in the country, and I think will be for quite some time. <Sync id=""L228""time=""00:36:03""/>If you look at the second area, it's -- we have purchased or we purchased last year about $50 billion worth of goods and services from U.S.-based suppliers. <Sync id=""L229""time=""00:36:19""/>Some significant portion of those are manufacturing-related, and so we've asked ourselves, what can we do to increase this? <Sync id=""L230""time=""00:36:27""/>And you may have seen that at the beginning of the quarter, sometime in April, I believe, we announced a fund, an advanced manufacturing fund that we're initially placing $1 billion in. <Sync id=""L231""time=""00:36:44""/>And we've already deployed $200 million of that. <Sync id=""L232""time=""00:36:47""/>And the first recipient is Corning in Kentucky and they'll be using that money to expand the plant to make very innovative glass. <Sync id=""L233""time=""00:36:59""/>And we purchase that glass and essentially export it to the world with iPhones and iPads. <Sync id=""L234""time=""00:37:07""/>We think there's more of these that we can do. <Sync id=""L235""time=""00:37:10""/>I think there's probably several plants that can benefit from having some investment to grow or expand or even maybe set up shop in the U.S. for the first time. <Sync id=""L236""time=""00:37:27""/>So we're very excited about that. <Sync id=""L237""time=""00:37:29""/>And then the third area is we have about 2/3 or so of our total employee base is in the U.S. despite only 1/3 of our revenues being here. <Sync id=""L238""time=""00:37:40""/>And we'll have some things that we'll say about that later in the year. <Sync id=""L239""time=""00:37:47""/>And so that's what we're doing from a job growth point of view and we're very, very proud of that. <Sync id=""L240""time=""00:37:54""/>If you -- now turning to China. <Sync id=""L241""time=""00:38:00""/>Let me sort of comment on what I assumed is at the root of your question about this VPN kind of issue. <Sync id=""L242""time=""00:38:08""/>Let me just address that head on. <Sync id=""L243""time=""00:38:13""/>The central government in China, back in 2015, started tightening the regulations associated with VPN apps. <Sync id=""L244""time=""00:38:23""/>And we have a number of those on our store. <Sync id=""L245""time=""00:38:30""/>The -- essentially, as a requirement to -- for someone to operate a VPN, they have to have a license from the government there. <Sync id=""L246""time=""00:38:44""/>Earlier this year, they began a renewed effort to enforce that policy, and we were required by the government to remove some of the VPN apps from the App Store that don't meet these new regulations. <Sync id=""L247""time=""00:39:01""/>We understand that those same requirements are on other app stores, and as we checked through that, that is the case. <Sync id=""L248""time=""00:39:10""/>Today, there's actually still hundreds of VPN apps on the App Store, including hundreds by developers that are outside China. <Sync id=""L249""time=""00:39:19""/>And so there continues to be VPN apps available. <Sync id=""L250""time=""00:39:23""/>We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but we -- like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business. <Sync id=""L251""time=""00:39:33""/>And we strongly believe that participating in markets and bringing benefits to customers is in the best interest of the folks there and in other countries as well. <Sync id=""L252""time=""00:39:48""/>And so we believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree. <Sync id=""L253""time=""00:39:53""/>And in this particular case, now back to commenting on this one, we're hopeful that over time, the restrictions that we're seeing are loosened because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate. <Sync id=""L254""time=""00:40:09""/>And I know that, that is a major focus there. <Sync id=""L255""time=""00:40:13""/>And so that's sort of what we're seeing from that point of view. <Sync id=""L256""time=""00:40:21""/>Some folks have tried to link it to the U.S. situation last year and they're very different. <Sync id=""L257""time=""00:40:30""/>In the case of the U.S., the law in the U.S. supported us. <Sync id=""L258""time=""00:40:37""/>It was very clear. <Sync id=""L259""time=""00:40:40""/>In the case of China, the law is also very clear there. <Sync id=""L260""time=""00:40:46""/>And like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we'd have to abide by them in both cases. <Sync id=""L261""time=""00:40:53""/>That doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view in the appropriate way; we always do that. <Sync id=""L262""time=""00:41:05""/>And so hopefully, that's a little bit probably more than you wanted to know but I wanted to tell you. <Sync id=""L274""time=""00:41:58""/>I think the upgrade rate is a function of many, many different things, from the size of the installed base, the age of the installed base, the product that is new at the time, the regional distribution, the upgrade plans that are in various markets around the world. <Sync id=""L275""time=""00:42:32""/>And so I think there's many, many factors in that it's not a simple thing that you can apply a set formula to -- or one variable or a couple of variable formula, in my opinion. <Sync id=""L276""time=""00:42:49""/>And -- but I think in general, because our installed base is -- was up strong double digit once again, there's a lot of factors that are very positive for us. <Sync id=""L277""time=""00:43:05""/>And between the upgraders and the switchers that we see and still -- the first-time buyer category is still out here, too, in several countries, including some that you may not think there is, there is still sizable base in some. <Sync id=""L278""time=""00:43:31""/>Between those 3 areas, I think we have a lot of opportunity. <Sync id=""L285""time=""00:44:30""/>As you know, Toni, we do not guide on channel inventory. <Sync id=""L286""time=""00:44:34""/>We've never done that. <Sync id=""L287""time=""00:44:36""/>We are providing a fairly wide range from a revenue standpoint, so obviously, that also has an impact on potential channel inventory levels. <Sync id=""L288""time=""00:44:51""/>One thing that I would tell you is that we feel very good about the performance of the business right now. <Sync id=""L289""time=""00:44:58""/>We think that our Services business will continue to grow well. <Sync id=""L290""time=""00:45:02""/>We've got a lot of momentum on iPad and Mac because we refreshed the lineups of those products. <Sync id=""L291""time=""00:45:09""/>Watch and AirPods are doing incredibly well. <Sync id=""L292""time=""00:45:12""/>We're getting a lot of positive customer feedback. <Sync id=""L293""time=""00:45:16""/>And I think in general, even the performance in China, Tim has mentioned it, we think that the performance will continue to improve. <Sync id=""L294""time=""00:45:24""/>So those are the drivers of our guidance range for the quarter. <Sync id=""L303""time=""00:46:37""/>On the first part of your question about original content, we have done some original content. <Sync id=""L304""time=""00:46:50""/>It's focused on Apple Music. <Sync id=""L305""time=""00:46:54""/>Currently, we have some more that's launching in a week or so that will be made available on Apple Music. <Sync id=""L306""time=""00:47:03""/>The objective of this is really twofold. <Sync id=""L307""time=""00:47:07""/>The one is for our own learning, given that we're new in the video space in terms of creation; and two is to give the Apple Music subscribers some exclusive content and hopefully grow our subscriber base. <Sync id=""L308""time=""00:47:24""/>And we've recently hired 2 great folks with lots of experience in creating content like Breaking Bad and The Crown and some really top-notch content. <Sync id=""L309""time=""00:47:43""/>And so we'll see how this area goes, but it's still an area of great interest. <Sync id=""L310""time=""00:47:52""/>In terms of autonomous systems, what we've said is that we are very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view. <Sync id=""L311""time=""00:48:02""/>We do have a large project going and are making a big investment in this. <Sync id=""L312""time=""00:48:10""/>From our point of view, autonomy is sort of the mother of all AI projects. <Sync id=""L313""time=""00:48:17""/>And the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one, but there are many different areas of it. <Sync id=""L314""time=""00:48:29""/>And I don't want to go any further with that. <Sync id=""L315""time=""00:48:33""/>But thank you for the question. <Sync id=""L321""time=""00:49:11""/>Mike, that is a great question. <Sync id=""L322""time=""00:49:14""/>Since we -- and I could not be more excited about AR and what we're seeing with ARKit and the early going. <Sync id=""L323""time=""00:49:22""/>And to answer a question about what category it starts in, just take a look at what's already on the web in terms of what people are doing and it is all over the place. <Sync id=""L324""time=""00:49:35""/>From entertainment to gaming, I've seen what I would call more small business solutions. <Sync id=""L325""time=""00:49:42""/>I've seen consumer solutions. <Sync id=""L326""time=""00:49:43""/>I've seen enterprise solutions. <Sync id=""L327""time=""00:49:46""/>I think AR is big and profound. <Sync id=""L328""time=""00:49:49""/>And this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it. <Sync id=""L329""time=""00:49:59""/>So I think that customers are going to see it in a variety of ways. <Sync id=""L330""time=""00:50:05""/>Enterprise, it takes a little longer sometimes to get going, but I can already tell you, there's lots of excitement in there, and I think we'll start to see some applications there as well. <Sync id=""L331""time=""00:50:19""/>And it feels great to get this thing going at a level that can sort of get all of the developers behind it. <Sync id=""L332""time=""00:50:31""/>So I couldn't be more excited about it. <Sync id=""L337""time=""00:51:07""/>Amit, Luca. <Sync id=""L338""time=""00:51:09""/>Our Services business is very broad. <Sync id=""L339""time=""00:51:12""/>We got multiple categories in the Services business, so it's difficult to talk about ARPU in general. <Sync id=""L340""time=""00:51:21""/>It doesn't make a lot of sense. <Sync id=""L341""time=""00:51:26""/>The reason for the acceleration also here is multiple factors. <Sync id=""L342""time=""00:51:31""/>One that is very, very important for us is the fact that the App Store, which is the largest of our Services categories, is seeing an increasingly larger amount of paying accounts. <Sync id=""L343""time=""00:51:49""/>On a year-over-year basis, the number of accounts that are actually transacting and paying on the App Store is growing very, very well. <Sync id=""L344""time=""00:51:58""/>It is happening for a variety of reasons. <Sync id=""L345""time=""00:51:59""/>One of them, for example, is the fact that we are making it easier for customers to pay on the App Store. <Sync id=""L346""time=""00:52:06""/>Outside the United States, in many markets, not every form of payment is accepted. <Sync id=""L347""time=""00:52:14""/>We're making it easier all the time. <Sync id=""L348""time=""00:52:17""/>We launched on Alipay, for example, in China during the December quarter. <Sync id=""L349""time=""00:52:21""/>That has obviously helped a lot with the growth in the number of paid accounts. <Sync id=""L350""time=""00:52:26""/>And we continue to bring more and more forms of payment in the App Store around the world. <Sync id=""L351""time=""00:52:34""/>That's a big reason for that. <Sync id=""L352""time=""00:52:36""/>The other reason why the number of paying accounts is growing is the fact that the quality and the quantity of content continues to improve, and so there's many more ways of experiencing games and entertainment and other apps on the store. <Sync id=""L353""time=""00:52:54""/>We have other businesses like the Apple Music streaming service, which is growing very fast because we just started it a couple of years ago, so we are getting a lot of new subscribers there. <Sync id=""L354""time=""00:53:07""/>Our iCloud storage business continues to grow very, very fast. <Sync id=""L355""time=""00:53:12""/>So it's multiple services. <Sync id=""L356""time=""00:53:15""/>The number of people transacting on our stores continues to grow. <Sync id=""L357""time=""00:53:20""/>In terms of ARPU, and maybe I can make a comment on ARPU specifically related to the App Store. <Sync id=""L358""time=""00:53:26""/>What we're seeing and we've seen over a long period of time as we keep track of these cohorts of customers, we see that as customers get on the App Store and start spending on it, we see this profile, spending profile is very similar across generations of customers. <Sync id=""L359""time=""00:53:46""/>People tend to spend more over time. <Sync id=""L360""time=""00:53:49""/>Obviously, you have different spending profiles in different geographies around the world, but in general, you see that trend across the board. <Sync id=""L366""time=""00:54:32""/>We have no comment on anything that's unannounced. <Sync id=""L373""time=""00:55:20""/>The answer to your first question is yes, I do think that we can grow both in units and market share. <Sync id=""L374""time=""00:55:33""/>We don't predict those things. <Sync id=""L375""time=""00:55:34""/>But yes, if you ask me what I think, that's what I think. <Sync id=""L376""time=""00:55:39""/>And so what are the drivers? <Sync id=""L377""time=""00:55:42""/>The installed base is growing. <Sync id=""L378""time=""00:55:44""/>It's still growing very strongly. <Sync id=""L379""time=""00:55:52""/>That will generate more upgrades over time. <Sync id=""L380""time=""00:55:57""/>I feel good about our ability to convince people to switch. <Sync id=""L381""time=""00:56:04""/>And where the developed markets, the first-time buyer rates are down other than places like Japan perhaps. <Sync id=""L382""time=""00:56:13""/>The emerging markets, we haven't even got started yet really. <Sync id=""L383""time=""00:56:20""/>And from a revenue point of view, we had very strong growth there on emerging markets ex China, we're up like 18% year-on-year. <Sync id=""L384""time=""00:56:32""/>It was a record for us. <Sync id=""L385""time=""00:56:34""/>So we see a lot of opportunity in these markets. <Sync id=""L386""time=""00:56:38""/>We are investing in India. <Sync id=""L387""time=""00:56:40""/>As you mentioned in your second point, we've already launched an app accelerator center, that's on top of working with the channel and looking at expanding our go-to-market in general. <Sync id=""L388""time=""00:56:57""/>And we've began to produce the iPhone SE there during the quarter, and we're really happy with how that's going, and so we're bringing all of our energies to bear there. <Sync id=""L389""time=""00:57:11""/>I see a lot of similarities where China was several years ago. <Sync id=""L390""time=""00:57:18""/>And so I'm very, very bullish and very, very optimistic about India. <Sync id=""L391""time=""00:57:24""/>Thanks very much, Brian. <Sync

id=""L154""time=""00:25:11""/>Gross margin guidance is strong, but it did tick down from your June quarter guidance. <Sync id=""L155""time=""00:25:16""/>And you also narrowed the range to 50 basis points. <Sync id=""L156""time=""00:25:19""/>I wonder if you could just address, what is the driver of the sequential downtick, and what gives you confidence that you have more visibility than you did 3 months ago? <Sync id=""L166""time=""00:26:36""/>And maybe a question for both Tim and Luca. <Sync id=""L167""time=""00:26:39""/>As you outlined on this call and at the developer conference in June, there is an unprecedented number of products that either ramped to volume or launched in the back half of this year. <Sync id=""L168""time=""00:26:50""/>So appreciating you only formally guide a quarter out, I wonder if there's any qualitative commentary you can provide to help us think about the back half of this calendar year and how all those new products that come into the model could impact either revenue seasonality versus past years or could impact just the costs associated with ramping that many products all at once. <Sync id=""L172""time=""00:27:52""/>Tim, could you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? <Sync id=""L173""time=""00:27:58""/>I think obviously, there's -- continues to be strong demand for smartphones but perhaps mix shift, I think you brought back the iPhone 6 this quarter to be a bit more price aggressive. <Sync id=""L174""time=""00:28:07""/>And then can you just talk a bit about how you see that market developing with the growth of WeChat and some of the other developments that are happening there? <Sync id=""L198""time=""00:31:23""/>Great. <Sync id=""L199""time=""00:31:23""/>And then can you talk a bit about the composition of the installed base of iPhones at this point as obviously, we're getting close to a refresh? <Sync id=""L200""time=""00:31:32""/>Just you brought in the iPhone SE. <Sync id=""L201""time=""00:31:36""/>You've obviously had strength at the high end. <Sync id=""L202""time=""00:31:37""/>I'm just trying to think about like what percent do you think have upgraded in the prior generation? <Sync id=""L203""time=""00:31:42""/>Any color you can give us on that? <Sync id=""L209""time=""00:32:57""/>I wonder if you wanted to make any comments about switching this quarter. <Sync id=""L213""time=""00:33:35""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L214""time=""00:33:36""/>And then a government question. <Sync id=""L215""time=""00:33:38""/>First of all, the President suggested that you may build 3 big beautiful plants. <Sync id=""L216""time=""00:33:43""/>I wonder if you'd comment on if that's a possibility, either directly or indirectly. <Sync id=""L217""time=""00:33:48""/>And then in China, I think we all understand that you have to work within the regulations, but maybe you could comment a bit on how you feel your working relationship is with the government and if there's certain lines that you can't cross. <Sync id=""L264""time=""00:41:26""/>A question for Tim maybe on the iPhone installed base. <Sync id=""L265""time=""00:41:30""/>At various points in the past, you've told us the rate at which that was growing. <Sync id=""L266""time=""00:41:34""/>At the end of the first half, what is that up year-on-year? <Sync id=""L267""time=""00:41:36""/>What rate is it growing? <Sync id=""L268""time=""00:41:36""/>Could you give us some sense of that? <Sync id=""L269""time=""00:41:38""/>And on upgrade rates over the longer term, there's lots of moving parts and I get that there's, I guess, geographic mix shift on your base. <Sync id=""L270""time=""00:41:45""/>There's any new phones that you may or may not bring out and how carriers promote your products. <Sync id=""L271""time=""00:41:51""/>But do you think this rate of upgrade is sustainable? <Sync id=""L272""time=""00:41:53""/>Do you think it gets faster over time? <Sync id=""L273""time=""00:41:55""/>How should we think about the major drivers as you foresee see for it? <Sync id=""L280""time=""00:43:46""/>I have one for Luca and one for Tim, please. <Sync id=""L281""time=""00:43:51""/>Luca, typically, in the fiscal Q4, Apple builds considerable iPhone channel inventory like 2 million or 3 million units. <Sync id=""L282""time=""00:44:04""/>You're starting from a very low point at the end of fiscal Q3 as you mentioned on the call with the drawdown. <Sync id=""L283""time=""00:44:11""/>As we think about what's embedded in your guidance for fiscal Q4 for channel inventory for iPhone, should we be expecting a sort of normal seasonal build? <Sync id=""L284""time=""00:44:22""/>Or is it likely to be significantly higher, given the very low starting point? <Sync id=""L295""time=""00:45:32""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L296""time=""00:45:34""/>Tim, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about 2 things that you mentioned in public before. <Sync id=""L297""time=""00:45:42""/>One is television, which you have described as an area of intense interest. <Sync id=""L298""time=""00:45:46""/>But I don't even think there was an update on Apple TV on this call, so perhaps you can talk to us about how you're thinking about content. <Sync id=""L299""time=""00:45:57""/>I know you're doing some original content creation and how that area is evolving and your thinking. <Sync id=""L300""time=""00:46:05""/>And then recently, you talked about how Apple is focusing on autonomous systems for automobiles. <Sync id=""L301""time=""00:46:14""/>And there's been press reports that Apple's been testing autonomous vehicles for potentially up to a year. <Sync id=""L302""time=""00:46:21""/>I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Apple's interest in autonomous vehicles and whether self-driving is really likely to be Apple's principal focus in the near to medium term. <Sync id=""L317""time=""00:48:43""/>I just have one question for Tim. <Sync id=""L318""time=""00:48:46""/>This may be a hard question to answer in a condensed way, but how would you describe what you expect the most near-term applications will be for developers to target using ARKit? <Sync id=""L319""time=""00:48:54""/>Will it be consumer iPhone and iPad applications, enterprise applications or I guess some combination of the 2? <Sync id=""L320""time=""00:49:01""/>And basically, how does this come to market in the most significant way in the next few quarters as Apple becomes the largest global platform for AR as you talked about? <Sync id=""L334""time=""00:50:46""/>I guess to start off with, on your Services segment, your revenues actually, I think, accelerated by [400] basis points to worse than what you guys had in the first half this year. <Sync id=""L335""time=""00:50:56""/>Could you just help us understand what's driving this? <Sync id=""L336""time=""00:50:58""/>Is there a way to think about ARPU in the traditional manner within that Services business versus the installed base growing? <Sync id=""L361""time=""00:53:57""/>Got it, that's really helpful. <Sync id=""L362""time=""00:54:00""/>And if I could just follow up. <Sync id=""L363""time=""00:54:03""/>On the iPhone side, there's been a large amount of discussion, I guess, in blogs and among your component suppliers that the timing this time may be somewhat different and delayed versus past. <Sync id=""L364""time=""00:54:13""/>Your guide almost seems you're more excited about this iPhone launch versus historically if the sequential growth is better. <Sync id=""L365""time=""00:54:18""/>So I guess beyond the fact we probably shouldn't read every blog and believe every blog, what do you think is different with this product launch or product availability through the cycle versus what you've seen historically? <Sync id=""L368""time=""00:54:49""/>Tim, growth in the smartphone market is now crawling along at about a low single-digit percentage. <Sync id=""L369""time=""00:54:56""/>I know iPhone grew about 2% year-over-year this quarter, and it looks like you had about a mid-teens market share in units in 2016. <Sync id=""L370""time=""00:55:04""/>So as we look forward, maybe 3 to 4 years, do you think Apple can expand its unit market share? <Sync id=""L371""time=""00:55:12""/>And if so, what will the drivers be? <Sync id=""L372""time=""00:55:15""/>And my second question is just about India, general thoughts around India in the quarter. information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of

<Sync id=""L182""/>I think you're absolutely right, Amit. <Sync id=""L183""/>We look at it, those are the two key elements for us. <Sync id=""L184""/>And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong double digits, and we're also seeing that the ARPU per paying customer is increasing double digits, right? <Sync id=""L185""/>So it's a combination of the two, obviously the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our Services improves all the time. <Sync id=""L186""/>And we also see that as people getting to the platform and start transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. <Sync id=""L187""/>And that's why we are excited about the future of the Services business and that's why as Tim said, we have a goal that it's already become a very large business. <Sync id=""L188""/>It's going to be a Fortune 100 company this year, but we have a goal to double it over the next four years. <Sync id=""L194""/>I'll take this one. <Sync id=""L195""/>If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12% and about four points of that was currency related. <Sync id=""L196""/>So it's an eight-point decline in constant currency. <Sync id=""L197""/>And then within Greater China if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat year-over-year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. <Sync id=""L198""/>And if you look at that on a constant currency basis it was actually up six. <Sync id=""L199""/>So it's a significantly better performance on sort of every way you look at it, versus what we had experienced the prior three quarters. <Sync id=""L200""/>Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best selling smartphone in China during the quarter, according to Kantar. <Sync id=""L201""/>Singles Day which is a huge day in China as you know, we were the most popular US brand on Alibaba. <Sync id=""L202""/>We set a new record for Services in China as the company did. <Sync id=""L203""/>And Mac revenue was up double digit year-over-year. <Sync id=""L204""/>iPad units were also up double digit in Mainland China which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. <Sync id=""L205""/>We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first time buyers, which is a very high number that we're pleased with. <Sync id=""L206""/>And then obviously our total install base continues to grow there in the strong double digits. <Sync id=""L207""/>That said, the challenges that are there, one, the currency has devalued 6% year-over-year, and two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficult market. <Sync id=""L208""/>And so I look at it and I'm encouraged with the significant improvement, but we're not without challenges there and I wouldn't want to imply that, although I do like many, many things that I've seen and how broad-based the pluses were across our product line. <Sync id=""L209""/>Thank you, Amit. <Sync id=""L210""/>Can we have the next question please? <Sync id=""L219""/>Yes, Shannon, I'll take it. <Sync id=""L220""/>Obviously within the Services business we have a number of categories. <Sync id=""L221""/>The App Store is the one that is driving significant growth right now. <Sync id=""L222""/>I said in my opening comments that we grew 43%, 13 weeks, over 13 weeks we grew own more for the quarter, right? <Sync id=""L223""/>And what we like about the App Store is that it's truly a global platform, so we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China for example. <Sync id=""L224""/>And we know that there are parts of the world where we can do better. <Sync id=""L225""/>We can grow, for example, our developer community in a number of emerging markets. <Sync id=""L226""/>And so as we look, as I was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth. <Sync id=""L227""/>On the music front, we are the market leader in digital music and obviously now by having the combination of the download business with the streaming service, which we didn't have until recently, we've been able to bring our music business back to growth, we've grown over the last three quarters, and we feel very good about that. <Sync id=""L228""/>Tim has talked about original content. <Sync id=""L229""/>We've had very good success with exclusives, so we know that it's another business that we can grow. <Sync id=""L230""/>Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickly, and so that is a business that also at the geographic level we can continue to grow significantly. <Sync id=""L231""/>Our AppleCare business is growing very well. <Sync id=""L232""/>A lot of it comes from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to grow very well, from double digits and as we've explained in the past, the vast majority of the service that we provide is not driven by what we sell during the last 90 days. <Sync id=""L233""/>It's much more driven by the install base and that gives us a tail wind. <Sync id=""L234""/>We're also opening up several new markets because we're accepting new forms of payment and therefore it's easier for, particularly for international customers to take advantage of our services. <Sync id=""L235""/>You were asking about the margin profile. <Sync id=""L236""/>We said it many times, in aggregate, our Services business tends to have margins that are above company averages. <Sync id=""L237""/>They are accretive so they help us quite a bit from a margin standpoint. <Sync id=""L238""/>Within the Services business, we have very different margin profiles also because as you know we account for some of these services in different ways. <Sync id=""L239""/>In some cases we transact on a buy-sell basis, in other cases we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, right? <Sync id=""L240""/>And that drives different margin percentages. <Sync id=""L245""/>Well Shannon, I was looking back since June of 2014, so we're talking about two and a half years ago, the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where we do business. <Sync id=""L246""/>And so obviously it is a difficult situation for us. <Sync id=""L247""/>I mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level. <Sync id=""L248""/>In emerging markets, it's incredible. <Sync id=""L249""/>The level of interest for our products continues to be phenomenal. <Sync id=""L250""/>The brand continues to be very aspirational. <Sync id=""L251""/>There's more and more people that can afford our products around the world. <Sync id=""L252""/>The middle class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil, but certainly strong dollar doesn't help us and therefore when we make pricing decisions, we need to be very careful. <Sync id=""L253""/>We always want to find the optimal balance between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the dollar appreciates. <Sync id=""L254""/>Thank you, Shannon. <Sync id=""L255""/>Could we have the next question please? <Sync id=""L260""/>Sure. <Sync id=""L261""/>We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins. <Sync id=""L262""/>We had guided 38 to 38.5, and we came in at 38.5 exactly. <Sync id=""L263""/>And really, the slight improvement over the mid point of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations. <Sync id=""L264""/>And so we got a bit more leverage out of the increased revenue levels. <Sync id=""L265""/>We feel very good about the gross margins for the quarter. <Sync id=""L266""/>Again keep in mind the strong dollar that doesn't help us on that front. <Sync id=""L270""/>That's a really good question. <Sync id=""L271""/>Despite the demonetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results. <Sync id=""L272""/>And so we were very happy about that. <Sync id=""L273""/>The demonetization impact has not worked its way through yet. <Sync id=""L274""/>It's still definitely having some overhang, but I think in the longer term it's a great move and I feel really good about how we're doing there. <Sync id=""L275""/>We are in discussions on a number of things including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be. <Sync id=""L276""/>Thank you, Brian. <Sync id=""L277""/>Could we have the next question please?\ <Sync id=""L282""/>Yes, Simona, it's Tim. <Sync id=""L283""/>We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the back drop of not predicting the demand very well in the iPhone 7 Plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter. <Sync id=""L284""/>If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter. <Sync id=""L285""/>And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter. <Sync id=""L286""/>If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last year. <Sync id=""L287""/>However, I think the big asterisk, and I share all this with you for transparency's sake, but I would tell you that the way we look at this is, in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it, but I wanted to share that with you anyway so you have the back drop. <Sync id=""L292""/>That's a big question. <Sync id=""L293""/>I don't have the answer in front of me. <Sync id=""L294""/>If you look at 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had. <Sync id=""L295""/>It set a unit record, so that I can share. <Sync id=""L296""/>In terms of how are we going to do, we don't provide guidance at the segment level, but sitting here today for Q2 I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. <Sync id=""L297""/>The real comp really begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we'll have to see how that plays out as we get closer to it. <Sync id=""L298""/>Thank you, Simona. <Sync id=""L299""/>Can we have the next question please? <Sync id=""L315""/>Well it's a good question. <Sync id=""L316""/>A number of points that I want to make, starting with the growth in the install base of iPhones. <Sync id=""L317""/>Yes, it's growing strong double digits and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our Services business. <Sync id=""L318""/>When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. <Sync id=""L319""/>For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. <Sync id=""L320""/>You've been quoting an overall total company growth rate, but when we look at it on a country specific level, there were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States where, for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. <Sync id=""L321""/>Same happened in a number of countries around the world starting with Canada and Australia, but also many places in Western Europe as well. <Sync id=""L322""/>Japan grew double digits in terms of units. <Sync id=""L323""/>So I think geographically, we are seeing very, very good performance, and the point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us. <Sync id=""L324""/>Could we sell significantly more or significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States where we've had, we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? <Sync id=""L325""/>When you think about the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously, that doesn't help us. <Sync id=""L326""/>But overall, I would say as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for -- and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, the new generation of phones, the upgrade rate, the percentage of people that have upgraded to the new phone has been very similar to what we've seen last year. <Sync id=""L327""/>The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. <Sync id=""L328""/>There was pent-up demand for the larger screen phones. <Sync id=""L329""/>And certainly as we look ahead, we have a role to play. <Sync id=""L330""/>The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate. <Sync id=""L336""/>I feel the same way I did in April of 2012. <Sync id=""L337""/>I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort. <Sync id=""L338""/>And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward. <Sync id=""L339""/>They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. <Sync id=""L340""/>And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason, and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate. <Sync id=""L341""/>And so it's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. <Sync id=""L342""/>From our point of view, this doesn't make sense and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts. <Sync id=""L343""/>In addition to that, as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld a billion dollars in payments that they owed us. <Sync id=""L344""/>And so we felt like we had no choice was the net of it. <Sync id=""L345""/>In terms of where it goes, we'll see. <Sync id=""L346""/>I don't like litigation and so if there's another way, then that would be great. <Sync id=""L347""/>But at this point, I don't see it. <Sync id=""L348""/>I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end, I think common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it is. <Sync id=""L349""/>And so that's the way I see it. <Sync id=""L350""/>Thanks for your question. <Sync id=""L351""/>Thank you, Toni. <Sync id=""L352""/>Can we have the next question please? <Sync id=""L359""/>The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million unit swing on channel inventory between the years. <Sync id=""L360""/>In the year ago quarter, we increased by 900. <Sync id=""L361""/>In this quarter we decreased by 700. <Sync id=""L362""/>On top of that, and from an ASP point of view, in the year ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge. <Sync id=""L363""/>That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it. <Sync id=""L364""/>We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. <Sync id=""L365""/>In addition to all of that, we did under call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. <Sync id=""L366""/>And so all in all, there was quite a few things going on there. <Sync id=""L367""/>If I sort of zoom out of the 90 day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. <Sync id=""L368""/>I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. <Sync id=""L369""/>When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. <Sync id=""L370""/>The customer sat numbers are through the roof. <Sync id=""L371""/>Literally the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. <Sync id=""L372""/>It's stunning. <Sync id=""L373""/>And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. <Sync id=""L374""/>And so it will damper this quarter somewhat. <Sync id=""L375""/>But again, beyond the 90 day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad. <Sync id=""L380""/>I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. <Sync id=""L381""/>I think there's lots more to do. <Sync id=""L382""/>I think its become -- every year it becomes more important to people's lives, and there's more things people are doing with it. <Sync id=""L383""/>I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about health, I could have talked more about CarPlay, the use of it in the enterprise is growing significantly. <Sync id=""L384""/>And so when I look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it. <Sync id=""L385""/>So this is one -- we think different about a bunch of things, so maybe this is just one more. <Sync id=""L386""/>Thank you, Steve. <Sync id=""L387""/>A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, the webcast on Apple.com/investor, and via telephone. <Sync id=""L388""/>The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. <Sync id=""L389""/>Please enter confirmation code 3378275. <Sync id=""L390""/>And these replays will be available by approximately 5 p.m. <Sync id=""L391""/>Pacific Time today. <Sync id=""L392""/>Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414 and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. <Sync id=""L393""/>Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I'm at 408-974-5420. <Sync id=""L394""/>Thanks again for joining us.","<Sync id=""L149""/>Yes, thank you. <Sync id=""L150""/>First, Luca, what are the factors that caused you to widen the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, and what are the one or two factors that put you at the low end versus the tailwinds that might put you at the high end of that range? <Sync id=""L151""/>Then I have a follow-up, thank you. <Sync id=""L159""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L160""/>And Tim, there's a reasonable probability that you may get access to the $200 billion plus of cash that's been locked overseas. <Sync id=""L161""/>So I think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around potentially larger M&A and some of the areas of interest that you've noted in the past, like owning more original content to penetrate more of the TV opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing. <Sync id=""L162""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L178""/>Thanks a lot, good afternoon, guys. <Sync id=""L179""/>First question, really appreciate the information you guys are providing around your Services business which was up 18% year-over-year. <Sync id=""L180""/>Could you just talk about how much of that do you think is growth in your install base versus increased monetization on a per iOS [device] spaces? <Sync id=""L181""/>It's weird to think about those in two separate terms. <Sync id=""L189""/>Perfect. <Sync id=""L190""/>If I could just switch gears on a follow-up. <Sync id=""L191""/>There's been a fair amount of discussions around your market share in China and what's happening over there. <Sync id=""L192""/>Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. <Sync id=""L193""/>So could you talk about what are the demand trends you're seeing there on the ground, and how do you see that transpire through the year? <Sync id=""L212""/>Thank you very much for taking my question. <Sync id=""L213""/>Can you talk a bit more about the Services business? <Sync id=""L214""/>And what I'm trying to figure out is I think the number was you're going to be doubling within the next four years, or at least that's your expectation. <Sync id=""L215""/>So what gets you there? <Sync id=""L216""/>Maybe if you talk about geographies and how penetrated you are in certain geographies? <Sync id=""L217""/>And then as you grow your Services business, is there anything we should keep in mind from a margin perspective? <Sync id=""L218""/>Would these be lower-margin services or similar, just so we can think about the trajectory and the contribution to bottom line? <Sync id=""L241""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L242""/>And then my follow-up is in terms of elasticity of demand and some of the moves from a currency perspective. <Sync id=""L243""/>I think in the past there was some concern in some of the emerging markets that you were basically not able to -- you weren't getting the volumes because you had to raise ASPs given currency, but you talked a lot about the emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter. <Sync id=""L244""/>So I'm just curious, you raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus, and what are you seeing and what are your customers saying in terms of willingness to pay up? <Sync id=""L257""/>Yes, Luca, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross margins. <Sync id=""L258""/>Sales obviously beat the high end of your revenue range, it looks like gross margins was dead down the middle. <Sync id=""L259""/>Can you talk about the puts and takes in gross margins in the quarter please? <Sync id=""L267""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L268""/>And Tim, I didn't hear much mention about India. <Sync id=""L269""/>How did India perform with the iPhone, and how should we think about it for 2017 especially with the 4G network going up? <Sync id=""L279""/>Hi, thank you. <Sync id=""L280""/>I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in the quarter, with record revenues in every region except for Greater China. <Sync id=""L281""/>I think it touched on the percent of switchers in China, but can you give a little more color on the split of upgrades and switchers in some of the other regions, and overall as well? <Sync id=""L288""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L289""/>And then just one follow-up on China specifically. <Sync id=""L290""/>As your comps get easier this year, I was curious if you think you're going to be returning to growth in that region? <Sync id=""L291""/>And then just to give us the context I know you talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in Mainland China, but curious if you strip out the double digit increase in iPad and MacBook and potentially the mix shift to the 7 Plus, curious what underlying iPhone units did in Mainland China? <Sync id=""L301""/>Yes, thank you. <Sync id=""L302""/>I just wanted to better understand the upgrade rate dynamics. <Sync id=""L303""/>So I think iPhone units on a sell-through basis were up about 8%. <Sync id=""L304""/>You had an extra week which gave you about 8%. <Sync id=""L305""/>I understand there were differences of the timing of the launch. <Sync id=""L306""/>So making all those adjustments it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. <Sync id=""L307""/>But Luca, you alluded to the fact your install base is growing double digits. <Sync id=""L308""/>So that would suggest to me that the upgrade rate, the upgrade percentage is actually declining. <Sync id=""L309""/>And more specifically, I'd just like your broader perspective on how investors should think about upgrade rates. <Sync id=""L310""/>It looked like they peaked in the iPhone 6 cycle, and it looks like they've been extending, going lower, replacement cycles have been extending over the last couple of years. <Sync id=""L311""/>I think some of the US carriers alluded to that as well. <Sync id=""L312""/>So I'm wondering if you could step back and just talk a little bit more broadly about how investors should think about -- or what the trajectory's been over the last two years, and how investors should think going forward? <Sync id=""L313""/>Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve, or replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? <Sync id=""L314""/>And what are some of the considerations we should think about? <Sync id=""L331""/>Okay, thank you. <Sync id=""L332""/>Tim, I have a question for you. <Sync id=""L333""/>Back in April 2012, you said on one of these earnings calls that, I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle. <Sync id=""L334""/>Yet you recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. <Sync id=""L335""/>I'm wondering if you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint, and what would be a successful end result of this litigation, and whether you can confirm whether there's any potential gross margin risk in the future as a result of this litigation? <Sync id=""L354""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L355""/>First I wanted to ask about the iPad. <Sync id=""L356""/>It looked like it was about to turn possibly even positive, and you said it was above your plan, but I think it was pretty well below the street's expectations. <Sync id=""L357""/>And the ASP deteriorated pretty significantly, I don't know if it's a mix shift. <Sync id=""L358""/>But maybe you can talk about the iPad and what you see going forward? <Sync id=""L376""/>Okay, that's great, thank you. <Sync id=""L377""/>And then, Tim, investors tend to think of the iPhone as mature and technology improvement is incremental, yet I believe you think there's plenty of runway left in terms of appealing new features. <Sync id=""L378""/>Do you think there are future enhancements coming that will be viewed by material by users, and particularly changes beyond foreign factor, beyond the way the phone looks? <Sync id=""L379""/>Are there functional things coming over time that you think could surprise people? information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.

start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. <Sync id=""L175""time=""00:26:40""/>As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially, and this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. <Sync id=""L176""time=""00:26:50""/>The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. <Sync id=""L177""time=""00:26:55""/>Obviously, that was also a negative. <Sync id=""L178""time=""00:26:57""/>And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. <Sync id=""L179""time=""00:27:08""/>To offset that and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. <Sync id=""L180""time=""00:27:16""/>And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is, of course, also helping given the profile of our gross margin for Services. <Sync id=""L181""time=""00:27:28""/>So that answers the question around Q2. <Sync id=""L182""time=""00:27:32""/>As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. <Sync id=""L183""time=""00:27:46""/>Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. <Sync id=""L184""time=""00:27:52""/>We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter. <Sync id=""L185""time=""00:27:59""/>And the cost pressures on memory will remain. <Sync id=""L186""time=""00:28:06""/>We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies and again, with a mix shift towards Services. <Sync id=""L187""time=""00:28:20""/>Yet, the impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. <Sync id=""L188""time=""00:28:25""/>You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being. <Sync id=""L189""time=""00:28:32""/>On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. <Sync id=""L190""time=""00:28:42""/>We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. <Sync id=""L191""time=""00:28:46""/>So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either. <Sync id=""L195""time=""00:29:44""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L196""time=""00:29:44""/>Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. <Sync id=""L197""time=""00:29:55""/>There was -- wound up the demand was much stronger to the 7 Plus than we had predicted. <Sync id=""L198""time=""00:30:03""/>And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred in this early -- this past quarter. <Sync id=""L199""time=""00:30:19""/>What did we learn from it? <Sync id=""L200""time=""00:30:21""/>Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. <Sync id=""L201""time=""00:30:25""/>And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learned to the next time. <Sync id=""L208""time=""00:31:07""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L209""time=""00:31:07""/>Thanks for the question, Shannon. <Sync id=""L210""time=""00:31:09""/>We saw in Q2 the -- a performance that, combined with Q1 and that formed the first half of the year, was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. <Sync id=""L211""time=""00:31:24""/>And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. <Sync id=""L212""time=""00:31:44""/>We -- also the Mac business did extremely well. <Sync id=""L213""time=""00:31:48""/>The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. <Sync id=""L214""time=""00:32:00""/>As I've mentioned in the -- in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall, and in China they grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. <Sync id=""L215""time=""00:32:19""/>And traffic, which, for us, is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell, traffic was up 27% year-on-year. <Sync id=""L216""time=""00:32:33""/>And now 7 of our top 10 highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. <Sync id=""L217""time=""00:32:41""/>And so that's the set of things that sort of went in our direction, so to speak. <Sync id=""L218""time=""00:32:48""/>On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. <Sync id=""L219""time=""00:33:00""/>And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:33:15""/>Also where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:33:24""/>And so that's sort of the set of things on the plus and minus side. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:33:32""/>We did perform about where I thought we would. <Sync id=""L223""time=""00:33:35""/>In fact, I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter and it was. <Sync id=""L224""time=""00:33:38""/>What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth but improve -- but make more progress. <Sync id=""L225""time=""00:33:52""/>And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. <Sync id=""L226""time=""00:34:00""/>And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there. <Sync id=""L229""time=""00:34:44""/>Well, Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program. <Sync id=""L230""time=""00:34:48""/>We've been pretty consistent during the last 5 years. <Sync id=""L231""time=""00:34:51""/>Essentially for the last 5 years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. <Sync id=""L232""time=""00:35:00""/>That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction, right? <Sync id=""L233""time=""00:35:09""/>We know how much we need to invest in the business. <Sync id=""L234""time=""00:35:13""/>We will never under-invest in the business. <Sync id=""L235""time=""00:35:15""/>We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. <Sync id=""L236""time=""00:35:21""/>And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. <Sync id=""L237""time=""00:35:33""/>It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. <Sync id=""L238""time=""00:35:37""/>The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country. <Sync id=""L239""time=""00:35:43""/>And there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. <Sync id=""L240""time=""00:35:49""/>Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change. <Sync id=""L246""time=""00:36:30""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L247""time=""00:36:31""/>I'll take it, Rod. <Sync id=""L248""time=""00:36:32""/>We don't disclose into this number of subscriptions. <Sync id=""L249""time=""00:36:36""/>Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. <Sync id=""L250""time=""00:36:40""/>Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. <Sync id=""L251""time=""00:36:47""/>There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. <Sync id=""L252""time=""00:36:58""/>But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. <Sync id=""L253""time=""00:37:07""/>It's a large number. <Sync id=""L254""time=""00:37:08""/>And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago, and we talked about 150 million. <Sync id=""L255""time=""00:37:14""/>So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores, right? <Sync id=""L256""time=""00:37:27""/>It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. <Sync id=""L257""time=""00:37:33""/>On -- as we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores and particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently 2 things. <Sync id=""L258""time=""00:37:46""/>We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. <Sync id=""L259""time=""00:37:51""/>And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we've had during these last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. <Sync id=""L260""time=""00:38:00""/>So there's a very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on the -- on our stores. <Sync id=""L261""time=""00:38:15""/>And that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. <Sync id=""L262""time=""00:38:19""/>What we're also seeing, as we look at the people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time, and we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. <Sync id=""L263""time=""00:38:44""/>People start at a certain level, and then they tend to spend more over time. <Sync id=""L264""time=""00:38:49""/>And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id=""L269""time=""00:39:41""/>Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. <Sync id=""L270""time=""00:40:03""/>And so that's how we think about it. <Sync id=""L271""time=""00:40:06""/>We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice versa. <Sync id=""L278""time=""00:40:51""/>Thanks for the question. <Sync id=""L279""time=""00:40:53""/>We have seen the Watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. <Sync id=""L280""time=""00:41:01""/>And we took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. <Sync id=""L281""time=""00:41:12""/>And we're really proud of the growth of the business. <Sync id=""L282""time=""00:41:18""/>The Watch units more than doubled in 6 of our top 10 markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. <Sync id=""L283""time=""00:41:30""/>And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. <Sync id=""L284""time=""00:41:34""/>When -- as some people are doing, when you begin to combine that -- combine the Watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, this was the first -- as you know, this is the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods, but it's still very much in the ramping mode. <Sync id=""L285""time=""00:41:55""/>And we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. <Sync id=""L286""time=""00:41:58""/>And then add the Beats products that our -- a group of our customers really enjoy as well and look on the trailing 12 months. <Sync id=""L287""time=""00:42:09""/>So this is not a forecast. <Sync id=""L288""time=""00:42:11""/>That business was well into the Fortune 500. <Sync id=""L289""time=""00:42:18""/>And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. <Sync id=""L290""time=""00:42:24""/>The Watch hasn't been out very long, and AirPods have been out there for 3, 4 months. <Sync id=""L291""time=""00:42:31""/>And so we feel really great about it. <Sync id=""L292""time=""00:42:34""/>Where does it go? <Sync id=""L293""time=""00:42:35""/>I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. <Sync id=""L294""time=""00:42:47""/>And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, it's -- the watch area is really hard. <Sync id=""L295""time=""00:42:58""/>It, in essence, from an engineering point of view, is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. <Sync id=""L296""time=""00:43:11""/>And so it's not -- I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. <Sync id=""L297""time=""00:43:17""/>But we're very committed to it and believe that -- it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. <Sync id=""L303""time=""00:43:50""/>I only glanced at it, and so I haven't had time to study it. <Sync id=""L304""time=""00:43:54""/>But in general, what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. <Sync id=""L305""time=""00:44:18""/>And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. <Sync id=""L306""time=""00:44:28""/>I don't know, but we are seeing that in full transparency. <Sync id=""L312""time=""00:45:48""/>The -- anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what is -- are called FRAND terms. <Sync id=""L313""time=""00:46:06""/>FRAND stands for fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms. <Sync id=""L314""time=""00:46:13""/>That's both the price and the business terms. <Sync id=""L315""time=""00:46:17""/>Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple, and so I don't believe that a -- I don't believe anyone's going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. <Sync id=""L316""time=""00:46:32""/>I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject. <Sync id=""L317""time=""00:46:38""/>But we shall see. <Sync id=""L318""time=""00:46:41""/>In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. <Sync id=""L319""time=""00:46:52""/>You don't know how much to pay. <Sync id=""L320""time=""00:46:54""/>And so they think we owe some amount. <Sync id=""L321""time=""00:47:00""/>We think we owe a different amount. <Sync id=""L322""time=""00:47:02""/>And there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there, and so at this point, we need the courts to decide that unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount. <Sync id=""L323""time=""00:47:19""/>But right now we're depending upon the courts to do that, and so that is the thinking. <Sync id=""L324""time=""00:47:26""/>The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value, and they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. <Sync id=""L325""time=""00:47:49""/>It's not -- it has nothing to do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. <Sync id=""L326""time=""00:47:59""/>And so we don't think that's right. <Sync id=""L327""time=""00:48:01""/>And so we're taking a principled stand on it, and we strongly believe we're in the right. <Sync id=""L328""time=""00:48:08""/>And I'm sure they believe that they are, and that's what courts are for. <Sync id=""L329""time=""00:48:13""/>And we'll let it go with that. <Sync id=""L337""time=""00:49:54""/>A lot of questions there. <Sync id=""L338""time=""00:49:59""/>Let me give you some color as I see it. <Sync id=""L339""time=""00:50:06""/>In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. <Sync id=""L340""time=""00:50:12""/>And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id=""L341""time=""00:50:33""/>Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you sort of have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. <Sync id=""L342""time=""00:50:52""/>And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that, actually, the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters. <Sync id=""L343""time=""00:51:04""/>In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any 6-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. <Sync id=""L344""time=""00:51:22""/>And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. <Sync id=""L345""time=""00:51:33""/>And so in 4 of the 5 operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth, and it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. <Sync id=""L346""time=""00:51:59""/>And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully, some of that are -- is useful for you. <Sync id=""L351""time=""00:52:31""/>As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction, but our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. <Sync id=""L352""time=""00:52:47""/>And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have. <Sync id=""L356""time=""00:53:26""/>We make it a point not to forecast by geo. <Sync id=""L357""time=""00:53:30""/>We just provide a current quarter forecast. <Sync id=""L358""time=""00:53:34""/>But as hopefully you've seen, as we began to give you more information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. <Sync id=""L359""time=""00:53:45""/>We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts. <Sync id=""L360""time=""00:53:54""/>And it is the third-largest smartphone market in the world today behind the -- China and the United States. <Sync id=""L361""time=""00:54:04""/>And so we believe, particularly now that a -- the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and it's continuing to be expanded, there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. <Sync id=""L362""time=""00:54:23""/>And so that's -- that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there. <Sync id=""L364""time=""00:54:42""/>Congratulations on returning to growth consistently.  <Sync id=""L365""time=""00:54:46""/>That's great. <Sync id=""L366""time=""00:54:47""/>I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments, you mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. <Sync id=""L367""time=""00:54:53""/>But I believe if we look at geographic information, India is really underpenetrated from an Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE. <Sync id=""L368""time=""00:55:03""/>You have the iPhone SE, your lower-priced iPhone. <Sync id=""L369""time=""00:55:07""/>Do you think that, say, this next 12, 18 months is going to be a turning point? <Sync id=""L370""time=""00:55:11""/>Or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there? <Sync id=""L371""time=""00:55:17""/>Or what's it really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a great opportunity? <Sync id=""L372""time=""00:55:24""/>Well, we think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we've brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in. <Sync id=""L373""time=""00:55:41""/>And that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. <Sync id=""L374""time=""00:55:51""/>Phil was just over there opening a developer center last quarter. <Sync id=""L375""time=""00:55:59""/>And so there's a -- there are a ton of things going on there. <Sync id=""L376""time=""00:56:04""/>And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. <Sync id=""L377""time=""00:56:10""/>Our growth rates are good, really good in -- by most people's expectations. <Sync id=""L378""time=""00:56:19""/>Maybe not mine as much. <Sync id=""L379""time=""00:56:24""/>And so we're putting a lot of energy in it, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. <Sync id=""L380""time=""00:56:34""/>And so I'm very excited about it. <Sync id=""L381""time=""00:56:39""/>The 4G network investment really began rolling in, in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know, and -- but they are moving fast. <Sync id=""L382""time=""00:56:51""/>They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started. <Sync id=""L383""time=""00:57:00""/>And it is truly impressive. <Sync id=""L384""time=""00:57:12""/>A replay of

id=""L391""time=""00:57:58""/>And thank you again for joining us.","<Sync id=""L169""time=""00:25:54""/>My first question is for Luca around gross margin. <Sync id=""L170""time=""00:25:57""/>How were you able to expand gross margin sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market? <Sync id=""L171""time=""00:26:08""/>And maybe if you can comment, in particular, whether the holdback of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year-on-year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year. <Sync id=""L192""time=""00:29:03""/>And just a follow-up for Tim. <Sync id=""L193""time=""00:29:05""/>As you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand it's selling incredibly well, and this is a product that was pretty severely supply constrained in the December quarter. <Sync id=""L194""time=""00:29:18""/>And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there's supply constraints and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on. <Sync id=""L203""time=""00:30:45""/>Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color, especially as you're going through the year? <Sync id=""L204""time=""00:30:54""/>And then obviously, you won't talk about the next product launch. <Sync id=""L205""time=""00:30:57""/>But just are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? <Sync id=""L206""time=""00:31:01""/>Was it all iPhone or mix? <Sync id=""L207""time=""00:31:04""/>Anything you can provide, and then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L227""time=""00:34:08""/>And then just -- I don't know if Luca wants to take this or -- but thoughts on cash usage, you increased your program, but you still have, I think, $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. <Sync id=""L228""time=""00:34:18""/>So I'm curious as to -- given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a, I don't know, strength perspective, just as we look forward to what hopefully will come through? <Sync id=""L242""time=""00:36:04""/>I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. <Sync id=""L243""time=""00:36:14""/>And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user is up, or maybe that was you, Luca. <Sync id=""L244""time=""00:36:20""/>But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. <Sync id=""L245""time=""00:36:27""/>And then I have one follow-up to that. <Sync id=""L265""time=""00:39:07""/>And then I had a follow-up for Tim. <Sync id=""L266""time=""00:39:10""/>Tim, I wanted to just ask -- the Services revenue keeps growing, and of course, the profit contribution from that is growing. <Sync id=""L267""time=""00:39:17""/>And we've also, at the same time, I think, seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with. <Sync id=""L268""time=""00:39:29""/>And I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that Services business, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. <Sync id=""L273""time=""00:40:25""/>Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? <Sync id=""L274""time=""00:40:29""/>The Watch, some people consider disappointing. <Sync id=""L275""time=""00:40:31""/>It had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically, the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. <Sync id=""L276""time=""00:40:37""/>The AirPods, of course, are doing well. <Sync id=""L277""time=""00:40:40""/>Do you see wearables, a, expanding over time into a broader product line; and b, increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term? <Sync id=""L298""time=""00:43:30""/>And then there was a -- you mentioned a 451 Research survey. <Sync id=""L299""time=""00:43:33""/>They did have a couple of findings that were kind of interesting. <Sync id=""L300""time=""00:43:36""/>One is a 9-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle. <Sync id=""L301""time=""00:43:41""/>And the other was a declining retention rate in the U.S. toward 80%. <Sync id=""L302""time=""00:43:46""/>Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned? <Sync id=""L308""time=""00:44:43""/>I have 2 as well. <Sync id=""L309""time=""00:44:45""/>First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. <Sync id=""L310""time=""00:44:56""/>And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. <Sync id=""L311""time=""00:45:21""/>And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risks to any degree and why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history. <Sync id=""L330""time=""00:48:20""/>I was wondering if you -- if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. <Sync id=""L331""time=""00:48:28""/>If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially, iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. <Sync id=""L332""time=""00:48:41""/>And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. <Sync id=""L333""time=""00:48:51""/>I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter, and the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. <Sync id=""L334""time=""00:49:05""/>So -- and then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones. <Sync id=""L335""time=""00:49:12""/>So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause. <Sync id=""L336""time=""00:49:27""/>And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced? <Sync id=""L348""time=""00:52:16""/>Had a question for Luca first. <Sync id=""L349""time=""00:52:18""/>Last year, you had a 4-million-unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. <Sync id=""L350""time=""00:52:24""/>So just curious what you're expecting for this year just so we have an apple-to-apple comparison as we think about your guidance. <Sync id=""L353""time=""00:53:01""/>And then just for Tim. <Sync id=""L354""time=""00:53:03""/>Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail, manufacturing and R&D presence there. <Sync id=""L355""time=""00:53:12""/>So just curious as you look at that market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 million to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there? information on this web

The ramp for iPhone X is going well, especially considering that iPhone X is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created and it has lots of new technologies in it. And so we're really happy that we're able to increase week-by-week what we're outputting, and we're going to get as many of them as possible to the customers as soon as possible. And so it's -- I can't predict at this point when that balance will happen. We -- and on -- in terms of March, we obviously don't give -- we don't give guidance beyond the current quarter. Let me talk a little bit about Q4 in China to give you a little bit of color on the results. The -- we increased market share for iPhone, Mac and iPad during the quarter. We hit all-time revenue records for services and for Mac in the -- for the PRC during the quarter. We had very strong iPad revenue growth. We had double-digit unit growth in iPhone, and both the upgraders and Android switchers were both up on a year-over-year basis during the quarter. And so, the results were broad based. They were pretty much across the board, as I indicated. The other thing that happened is that the decline that we've been experiencing in Hong Kong moderated. And so it's still down year-over-year, but less so than it was. And part of that is the compare is an easier compare. And then, finally, in terms of another headwind that is a little less than it was, currency has been affecting us more significantly last quarter in China. It affected us 1 percentage point. And so the sum of all that, I feel great about the results. We don't obviously provide geographic-specific guidance, but you can see from our overall guidance, we think we're going to have a really strong quarter. Michael, we never go through mix. But I would share with you that the iPhone X orders are very strong for both direct customers and for our channel partners, which as you know, are lots of carrier throughout the world. And we couldn't be more excited to get underway. And I think as of a few minutes ago, the first sales started in Australia. And I'm told we had several hundred people waiting at the store in Sydney and I'm getting similar reports from across that region. Yes, it's a great question.  The reason I'm so excited about AR is I view that it amplifies human performance instead of isolates humans. And so, as you know, it's the mix of the virtual and the physical world. And so it should be a help for humanity, not an isolation kind of thing for humanity. As I go through different countries, as I've been traveling lately and looking at things, some things in the market, other things that are coming, the very cool thing is they're all over the place. I see things that the consumer's going to love because it's going to change shopping. I see things that consumers will love on the gaming side and the entertainment side. I see business-related AR apps as well that are going to be great for productivity and between small and large business. And I see apps that makes me want to go back to K-12 again and repeat my schooling because I think it changes the game in the classroom a lot. And so the real beauty here is that it's mainstream. And of course, Apple is the only company that could have brought this, because it requires both hardware and software integration and it requires sort of making a lot of -- or giving the operating system update to many people at once. And we -- and the software team worked really hard to make that go back several versions of iPhone so that we sort of have hundreds of millions of enabled devices overnight. And so there's 1,000-plus in the App Store right now. I think this is very much like in 2008, when we fired the gun in the overall App Store. And so, that's what it feels like to me, and I think it will just get bigger from here. Yes, in terms of what we saw in Q4, you can probably tell from the ASP, we had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones. And we've tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone that may have a more limited budget, and we've got some iPhones that are really great for that market. And then, we've got 3 new iPhones, and people will look at these and decide which one they want. And so we -- this is the first time we've ever been in the position that we've had 3 new iPhones at once like this at the top end of the line. And it's the first time we've had a staggered launch. And so, we're going to see what happens. But we've put our absolutely best thinking that we have here in the guidance that Luca presented. And you can tell from that, that we're bullish. Yes, Shannon, it's Luca. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there was a $640 million adjustment. There was a one-off change. And it's important to call it out because, of course, it's a one-off. And so, the underlying growth rate for services in the quarter was fantastic, was 24%, the highest growth rate that we've had for services during fiscal '17. So the business is going incredibly well. I would highlight maybe 3 of these businesses within services. The App Store set a new all-time record. It's growing incredibly well. The number of paying accounts continues to grow very strongly, and that's very, very important to us for the App Store business. Apple Music was up -- subscriptions were up 75% year-over-year. We're getting the highest conversion rates that we've had since the launch of the service. And so we turned the corner in music. You remember that a few years ago, we were actually declining in music; now with the streaming service in addition to the download business, the business is growing again. And that really helps the growth rate for the entire Services business. iCloud is a service that continues to grow very strong double digits, and that's also helping. So we already become the size of a Fortune 100 company. We set a goal for ourselves to double what we did in fiscal '16 and the trajectory is actually quite positive. Obviously, I'm not going to talk about mix. It's not something that we've done in the past. If you look at the 8 and 8 Plus, when we launched them, they instantly became our top 2 selling products. If you look at 8 Plus in particular, to provide a little color there, 8 Plus for that -- for the period of time that we can measure to date, has gotten off to the fastest start of any Plus model. That, for us, was a bit of a surprise, and it's a positive surprise, obviously. And so we'll see what happens next. As I've mentioned before, we've never had 3 products, and it's only today that the first customers can certainly look at all 3 of those. And I'm sure there's been some people that wanted to do that before deciding even which one. And so we'll see what happens there. But in terms of price elasticity, I think it's important to remember that a large number of people pay for the phone by month. And so if you were to go out on the -- just the U.S., since that tends to be more the focus of this call. If you look at the U.S. carriers, I think you would find -- you could buy an iPhone X for $33 a month. And so if you think about that, that's a few coffees a week. It's less than a coffee a day at one of these nice coffee places.  The other thing to keep in mind is that many people are now trading in their current iPhone on the next iPhone. And the residual value for iPhone tends to be the highest in the industry and many people pick up $300, $350 or so for their iPhone. And so that even reduces the monthly payment less. And then, obviously some carriers also have promotional things going on. And so I do think it's important to try to place it in that context. In terms of the way we price, we price to the sort of the value that we're providing. We're not trying to charge the highest price we could get or anything like that. We're just trying to price it for what we're delivering. And iPhone X has a lot of great new technologies in there that are leading the industry, and it is a fabulous product and we can't wait for people to start getting it in their hands. I think, Steve, we've been in a competitive position. And so, I probably -- maybe have a different view than you do or the folks that you're quoting. There's always doubting Thomases out there. I've been hearing those for the 20 years I've been here and suspect I'll hear about them until I retire. And so, I don't really listen to that too much. There's lots of fantastic people here and they're doing unbelievable things. And yes, I view AR as profound. Not today, not the apps that you'll see on the App Store today, but what it will be, what it can be, I think its profound and I think Apple is in a really unique position to lead in this area. Toni, I'll take that one. When -- you said, we price our products for the value that we deliver.  We also said that every time we launch new products, the cost structures of the new products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It's inevitable. We are adding new technologies, new features. And therefore, the cost structures go up. We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures and, over the life cycle of the product, we are able to bring them down. There are a lot of elements in the gross margin line that we have good control over and we -- there are also elements that we don't control. Take for example, foreign exchange, which has been a significant headwind for the company for the last 3 years now. Also, the mix of products that we sell into the market tends to change over time. And that also has an impact on the overall gross margin for the company. There are situations where the commodities markets are in good shape. There are situations where commodity markets can be a bit out of balance. We have a case right now around memory pricing, which is a headwind for the time being. So there's many puts and takes. The fact that our Services business is growing should be a positive because our services margins tend to be accretive to company margin. So there's many puts and takes that we tend to think about maximizing gross margin dollars. And -- because we think that's the most important thing for investors at the end of the day.  When we look at our track record over years, I think we found a good balance between unit growth and gross margins and revenue, and we will continue to do that as we go forward. That truth is, we don't know. We've put our best estimate into the guidance. And you can see from the guidance that we're very bullish. And so, we feel really great about our -- about the product lineup. We're -- just sold the first units minutes ago. And so we'll see how things go. Until you get all of them out there, where customers have the ability to demo and so forth, I think it's -- I think any kind of mix discussion is very much estimating. And so we put our best estimates in but granted, we've never done this before. So there's no comparison here, with either the 3 iPhones nor the staggered launch. And so, we're going to learn something. And I'll ask my original question and follow-up at the same time because they're slightly different topics. But you had mentioned great success in India, I believe, Tim.  In your prepared comments, you mentioned, I think, India had doubled year-over-year. Based upon market analysis, it looks like Apple is still just a relatively small sliver of the pie there. So Tim, what would it take to be even more successful in India? Is it a manufacturing footprint there with your partners? Is it more physical stores? Is it lower price points? Is it the bandwidth that has now caught up to many other countries? Or how should we think about that? And then, the follow-up question is on the AR/VR, when will it really show up in your income statement? Are you hoping more for hardware sales or services to the apps or where the excitement will then be monetized within Apple? In terms of India, many of the things that you mentioned are correct. Growing a market like India is a result of all of those things and doing them all well. And so, it's analogous to the many years that we put into China. It's building stores. It's building channels. It's building markets. It's building the developer ecosystem. It's having the right product lineup for the market. And I feel like we're making good progress there and are gaining understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go. I don't -- which I sort of see as an opportunity instead of a problem. And I do feel great about the growth rate. And so, that's India. I think it's all of those things. As you know, we -- as I've said, I think we talked about before, we started manufacturing the iPhone SE there 6, 9 months ago. So -- and the majority of iPhone SEs that we sold in the domestic market last quarter were manufactured there. And so we also have that going and are hoping that, that winds up saving some amount of money over time and avoiding some of the compounding of taxes, et cetera. The bandwidth issue has also been an issue, but as you point out, it is being addressed. And between the large carriers there with Bharti and now Jio investing the way they are, the service in India is materially better than it was just 12 months ago. So there's been a sea change there in a short period of time. So I feel good about all that, but we have a long way to go. In terms of the monetization question on AR/VR, we tend to focus first and foremost on customer experience. And so we're all about making sure the experience is great. And we think that if we get the experience right, that revenues and profits will be a result of getting that right. And so we're much -- we're very much focused on the experience right now. Yes, Amit. So we're guiding 38% to 38.5%. That's up 35 bps sequentially. Obviously, we're getting the leverage from the larger volumes. As I mentioned, I think, to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we launch new products. So that is going to be the offset. And I mentioned, particularly the impact from the memory pricing environment, which is a headwind at this point. Just to size it for you, the impact of memory on our gross margin is 40 bps sequentially and 110 bps on a year-over-year basis. So they are meaningful impacts. And I think that is what, I think, probably you're referring to. Yes, I think it's both. As I mentioned, particularly on the App Store, which is very important to us, the number of paying accounts has grown a lot. It's grown a lot because, as you said, the installed base has grown, but also because we have made a number of changes that have made it easier for our customers around the world to participate on the App Store and be able to transact on the Apps Store. We are accepting, for example, more forms of payment today than we were 12 months ago or even 6 months ago. So that's been very important. We also see that there is a typical spending curve for our customers when they start transacting on the store. They start at a certain level and they tend, over time, to get more familiar with the store and they start to spend more. We're also now very recently made some changes, as you probably have seen, to the design of the App Store. And I was mentioning during the prepared remarks that these changes have been received very favorably. And so, people now are spending more time on the store, they download more apps and then, over time, translates into monetization. But we also have other businesses that are growing very, very fast and actually accelerating. I mentioned Music; I mentioned iCloud. And so it all adds up. And as you correctly point out, our growth rate is accelerating. Brian, I hate to repeat this, but we don't really disclose mix. We view it as competitive information that we want to hold tightly ourselves. In terms of the way the preorder process works in China in the channel, so not in our direct channel, but in the broader carrier channel and channel, they generally take indications of interest versus something that I would label a preorder. And so, I would hesitate to even quote a number for fear it could be misconstrued. And we'll find out what the demand and where the supply and demand meets sometime in the future. I don't know when yet. But we're really excited to get going to find out. Our emerging market performance during the quarter was very strong. Not -- and if you take China out, it's even stronger. But you can see the -- that China rebounded. And as I've indicated before, the China rebound was broad-based across the products. And so we just had a phenomenal quarter on iPad, on the Mac, on Services, on Apple Watch, on iPhone. I mean, we're literally, we're firing on all cylinders. And so that's what -- that and our new products give us great confidence headed into this holiday season that this is going to be the best holiday season yet. Thank you, Brian.

And given it's likely to be not in the December quarter, should we think about March as a better-than-seasonal revenue quarter because of that iPhone X ramp? And then, I have a follow-up. Okay. And in China, growth returned to strong double digits, 12% up. You've talked historically about that region being more sensitive than others to form factor changes and the new iPhone X form factor was not available in September. And so, should we assume that growth in that region only accelerates from here as that new product gets pushed into the market? Is there any information you can provide on how iPhone X preorders compare to what you saw with iPhone 8 preorders? And then, I have a follow-up as well. And we're excited about augmented reality. And from your perspective and maybe from our perspective on the outside looking in, how do we gauge the success of AR? And what are some of the applications of the technology that you're most excited about today? A couple questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit about how you're thinking in terms of the lineup? You go from $340 -- and this is for iPhone. You go from $349 to above $1,000, and it appears that you probably sold a fair amount of the lower end, perhaps that was just some of the switchers in China and maybe drove some of the growth in China in terms of market share. But how are you sort of thinking about what went into the guidance for the December quarter? Are you seeing really strong demand at the low end? And obviously, expected benefit from the X at the high-end. I'm just trying to understand, because you have such a broader lineup than you've had in prior years. Great. And then, in terms of services, $8.5 billion, up 34%. Can you talk about some of the portions of that, that outperformed? How sustainable? You mentioned China in terms of significant growth in services. But I'm just curious, it's a pretty remarkable number, so I'm curious what the drivers were. I wanted to try to push a little bit more on the mix. Could you comment whether the 8 Plus outsold the 8 in the quarter? There seems to be some data that suggests that. And the 451 Research survey that you're alluding to also finds that over the next 90 days, those buying an iPhone, 43% are planning on buying the X. Could you comment upon your expectations in terms of the mix going forward? And if you won't do that, perhaps you could comment a bit about you're thinking in terms of pushing price elasticity. I think a couple of years ago, no one would have imagined selling a phone at this price. And obviously, you're pretty confident that you can do it. And then, I wanted to ask. The Street historically has been a little skeptical about continued innovation, and you suggested there is more to grow. Historically, you weren't first to large screens. You weren't first to OLED. Now, though, you're leading in AR. You're leading with Face ID, which [the all-in a year ago, as some of your guys had suggested, was kind of very reminiscent of the aggressive Apple. Is it possible going forward that you could accelerate share gains from Android because you're now in a stronger competitive position? Just following up a little bit on that question, Tim. You talked a bit about providing a lot of value and that Apple sets its prices according to value. And I think, given the uniqueness of the product you have with the iPhone X in particular, that makes a lot of sense. I guess, the question is, given the uniqueness of the value that you have in the marketplace, why shouldn't we -- should we or why shouldn't we expect gross margins to improve this cycle versus previous ones? And perhaps, you can talk a little bit about how you think about pricing in the context of gross margin. And I have a follow-up, please. Okay. And then, I wanted to revisit this notion of supply and demand. And I realize it's very early and you can't make predictions. I think, a common investor question is the iPhone X was made available for sale; it quickly had pushed out availability levels to unprecedented levels versus history. And so I think the really significant question is, is that initial pushout really a function of uniquely strong demand versus history? Or is that pushout in availability really a function of much weaker supply versus history? So it would be really helpful.  You have in the past commented on first 24-hour orders for which there were 4 million-plus for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. You have, very often on this call, talked about targeting when you think you could reach supply-demand balance. So it'd be really helpful if you could provide some context in terms of what you know either about initial orders or about the supplies versus history that can help investors try and better understand the little data points that they're seeing in terms of availability of the device. I have 2 as well. I guess, maybe to start with on gross margins. Luca, year-over-year, revenues are going to be up high single-digits at the midpoint, gross margins will be down a little. Could you just talk about what other puts and takes on that.  And are yield and efficiencies broadly much more severe this time versus what you've seen historically? Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess, if I could just follow up on the services line. You just talked about it a fair amount earlier, but even if I exclude the onetime gain, it looks like the back half of '17 accelerated by 500 basis points in fiscal '17 versus the first half of '17. Qualitatively or quantitatively, is there a way to think about how much of this is from expanding the installed base, which is 1 of the 3 things you mentioned, I think, versus more dollar per iOS device that you're seeing? Yes, Tim, wondering if we take a look at mainland China and we think about iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, they've been on sale for a while now. What has been the -- just general response to those 2 new iPhones? And also, preorders around the iPhone X in mainland China. And Tim, it's interesting that sales grew 16% sequentially. If you look at the past 5 years, sales were up 7% in the September quarter. So that's an average. Yet you didn't have all your iPhones in the market. So if you had to -- what would you attribute that to? It's a pretty big disconnect, 16% versus an average of 7%. information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.

You think about the advances in technology that were a part of the iPhone X from -- we went from Touch ID to Face ID. <Sync id=""L193""time=""00:31:07""/>Face ID has been incredibly well received. <Sync id=""L194""time=""00:31:11""/>The wireless charging, the edge-to-edge Super Retina display and totally new gestures, the user experience is different. <Sync id=""L195""time=""00:31:22""/>And so it's great to get that kind of feedback. <Sync id=""L196""time=""00:31:28""/>Now if you look at the sort of the overall iPhone line, which gets to the essence of the question I think, I looked -- I reviewed the top mini markets. <Sync id=""L197""time=""00:31:39""/>I'll talk briefly about the top 4. In urban China and the U.S., the top 5 smartphones last quarter were all iPhones. <Sync id=""L198""time=""00:31:50""/>And in Japan and the U.K., 6 of the top 7 were iPhones. <Sync id=""L199""time=""00:32:00""/>And so in a market that is as large as the smartphone market is, people want some level of choice, and they're deciding which ones to buy. <Sync id=""L200""time=""00:32:17""/>But we feel fantastic particularly as it pertains to iPhone X. <Sync id=""L206""time=""00:33:18""/>Katy, I'll take the question. <Sync id=""L207""time=""00:33:22""/>We are guiding to $60 billion to $62 billion. <Sync id=""L208""time=""00:33:24""/>It's strong double-digit growth, 13% to 17%. <Sync id=""L209""time=""00:33:31""/>In context, it's $7 billion to $9 billion above last year. <Sync id=""L210""time=""00:33:36""/>So when you put things in perspective and you add the $10 billion of growth that we had in the first quarter and the $7 billion to $9 billion that we're guiding to for the second quarter, you're talking about $17 billion to $19 billion of growth in 6 months. <Sync id=""L211""time=""00:33:53""/>This is at the macro level. <Sync id=""L212""time=""00:33:57""/>We typically don't go into this level of detail but I think it's important this quarter to give you additional color. <Sync id=""L213""time=""00:34:06""/>And maybe the 2 most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year during the March quarter, and also and importantly, that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis will be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. <Sync id=""L214""time=""00:34:31""/>Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up with our iPhone units and ASP that are embedded in our guidance. <Sync id=""L215""time=""00:34:43""/>Historically, because of the channel fill and the holiday season, our sell-in volume during the December quarter is generally higher than sell-through. <Sync id=""L216""time=""00:34:54""/>This year, the difference was further magnified because we shipped iPhone X in November rather than the September quarter. <Sync id=""L217""time=""00:35:04""/>We had a very successful product ramp. <Sync id=""L218""time=""00:35:07""/>We were able to reach supply-demand balance in December, which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. <Sync id=""L219""time=""00:35:16""/>And this will have an effect on both units and ASP in Q2. <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:35:21""/>Now for units, there is a second point to consider. <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:35:24""/>We typically reduce channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2 because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:35:38""/>So we anticipate doing that in Q2 this year as well. <Sync id=""L223""time=""00:35:42""/>For ASPs, there's also another element that we need to consider. <Sync id=""L224""time=""00:35:46""/>As you know, our newest products this year have higher ASPs than they had in the past. <Sync id=""L225""time=""00:35:52""/>And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically. <Sync id=""L226""time=""00:36:07""/>So in summary, our guidance for iPhone, we got double-digit year-over-year growth and acceleration of sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id=""L227""time=""00:36:21""/>For the balance of the company, in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong double digits year-over-year and particularly very strong performance in service and in wearables like we've seen during the December quarter. <Sync id=""L228""time=""00:36:34""/>I hope this helps. <Sync id=""L233""time=""00:37:01""/>Yes, let me walk you through the sequential first. <Sync id=""L234""time=""00:37:05""/>So we're guiding about flat sequentially in spite of the loss of leverage, right? <Sync id=""L235""time=""00:37:12""/>That is the largest element that we need to take into account because of our typical seasonality. <Sync id=""L236""time=""00:37:17""/>And we expect to offset the seasonality impact with cost improvements and with mix. <Sync id=""L237""time=""00:37:25""/>FX, on a sequential basis, is fairly muted because as you know, we got a hedging program that protects us from the volatility of currencies in the short term. <Sync id=""L238""time=""00:37:39""/>Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term, if it holds, will be a positive, but it's not something that you're going to be seeing translate into gross margin tailwind quickly. <Sync id=""L239""time=""00:37:53""/>And so I think we need to keep that in mind. <Sync id=""L240""time=""00:37:56""/>We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory pricing environment, which we think is going to start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year, but it still has a negative impact in the March quarter. <Sync id=""L247""time=""00:38:57""/>Mike, you did a good job of answering your question, I think, at the beginning that we don't really comment on future products. <Sync id=""L248""time=""00:39:03""/>But I would tell you that we're thrilled with the reception of iPhone X. And as we said when we launched it, we were setting up the next decade. <Sync id=""L249""time=""00:39:17""/>And that is how we look at it, and so that's the reason it's chock-full of incredible innovation. <Sync id=""L250""time=""00:39:25""/>And so you can bet that we're pulling that string. <Sync id=""L257""time=""00:39:57""/>I see AR as being profound. <Sync id=""L258""time=""00:40:00""/>I think it's -- AR has the ability to amplify human performance instead of isolating humans. <Sync id=""L259""time=""00:40:09""/>And so I am a huge, huge believer in AR. <Sync id=""L260""time=""00:40:14""/>We put a lot of energy on AR. <Sync id=""L261""time=""00:40:18""/>We're moving very fast. <Sync id=""L262""time=""00:40:19""/>We've gone from ARKit 1.0 to 1.5 in just a matter of months. <Sync id=""L263""time=""00:40:27""/>I couldn't be happier with the rate and pace of the developer community, how fast they're developing new things. <Sync id=""L264""time=""00:40:35""/>And I don't want to say what we may do, but I could not be happier with how things are going right now. <Sync id=""L275""time=""00:42:18""/>I think it's up to investors as to what things they would like to focus on, so I don't want to put myself in a position of that. <Sync id=""L276""time=""00:42:29""/>The way that I look at this, and I -- the numbers you quoted, I have a different view of them. <Sync id=""L277""time=""00:42:39""/>But generally, what we see with iPhone is the reliability of iPhone is fantastic. <Sync id=""L278""time=""00:42:47""/>The second -- or the previously owned market has expanded in units over the years. <Sync id=""L279""time=""00:42:56""/>And you see, in many cases, carriers and retailers having very vibrant programs around trading an iPhone in. <Sync id=""L280""time=""00:43:07""/>And because iPhone has the largest residual rate on it. <Sync id=""L281""time=""00:43:13""/>It acts as a buffer for the customer to buy a new one, and it winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. <Sync id=""L282""time=""00:43:29""/>And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. <Sync id=""L283""time=""00:43:34""/>It's more people on iPhones, the better. <Sync id=""L284""time=""00:43:40""/>I would like to point out that the -- every major product hit a high on the active installed base. <Sync id=""L285""time=""00:43:50""/>And so that's iPads, it's Mac, and those are huge numbers as well. <Sync id=""L286""time=""00:43:59""/>And so as we've always said, there's a large part of the -- or the vast majority of the services kind of are mapped to the installed base instead of the quarterly sales. <Sync id=""L287""time=""00:44:12""/>And there's -- this quarter is no different on that. <Sync id=""L288""time=""00:44:22""/>Toni -- on the battery, Toni, we did not consider in any way, shape or form what it would do to upgrade rates. <Sync id=""L289""time=""00:44:32""/>We did it because we thought it was the right thing to do for our customers. <Sync id=""L290""time=""00:44:37""/>And I -- sitting here today, I don't know what effect it will have. <Sync id=""L291""time=""00:44:44""/>And again, it's not -- was not in our thought process of deciding to do what we've done. <Sync id=""L301""time=""00:45:44""/>Toni, on the tax rate, I will make 2 comments. <Sync id=""L302""time=""00:45:49""/>First of all, the new tax law in the United States is complex. <Sync id=""L303""time=""00:45:54""/>And I think we, as many other companies, are really trying to absorb what this all means. <Sync id=""L304""time=""00:46:01""/>And I think we're going to be receiving, over the next few months, implementation guidance. <Sync id=""L305""time=""00:46:06""/>So we've taken some provisional estimates in coming up with our tax entries for the quarter. <Sync id=""L306""time=""00:46:16""/>And we will have to do that as we go forward here during the year. <Sync id=""L307""time=""00:46:20""/>So it may be a bit bumpy in the short term as we understand the law in full and it actually gets explained in full. <Sync id=""L308""time=""00:46:29""/>But I would say that for the current fiscal year, the guidance that we provided for Q2 should be approximately what you should be seeing. <Sync id=""L309""time=""00:46:40""/>As we get into a new fiscal year, so many things change, and we need to take that into account, the geographic mix of our products and so on. <Sync id=""L310""time=""00:46:49""/>So -- but I would say for the remainder of the year, it's what we're guiding to. <Sync id=""L311""time=""00:46:54""/>I think on the replacement cycle, Toni, the answers probably look different by geography. <Sync id=""L312""time=""00:47:04""/>In those geographies that had -- in the early days of the smartphone market, had very traditional subsidies where you paid the $199 out the door, $99 or whatever, I think it's accurate to say those types of markets, the replacement cycle is likely longer. <Sync id=""L313""time=""00:47:31""/>Where that isn't the case, I'm not nearly as sure on that. <Sync id=""L314""time=""00:47:38""/>I would point out that, that happened some time ago, and so it's very difficult currently to ever get a real-time handle on replacement rate because you're obviously not -- you don't know the replacement rate for the products you're currently selling. <Sync id=""L315""time=""00:47:56""/>You only know that in a historical sense. <Sync id=""L316""time=""00:48:01""/>So it's not something that we overly fixate on. <Sync id=""L321""time=""00:48:32""/>Laura, I'm sorry. <Sync id=""L322""time=""00:48:32""/>I missed the first part of that. <Sync id=""L323""time=""00:48:39""/>You broke up on the phone. <Sync id=""L332""time=""00:49:06""/>Laura, you're cutting in and out, but I'm going to take a swing at what I think you're asking. <Sync id=""L333""time=""00:49:11""/>I think you're asking, are there more active users today than there were 2 years ago when we had 1 billion active devices? <Sync id=""L334""time=""00:49:21""/>And the answer is absolutely. <Sync id=""L335""time=""00:49:24""/>There are many, many, many more. <Sync id=""L339""time=""00:49:40""/>Well, that 1.4, I don't know where that came from. <Sync id=""L340""time=""00:49:43""/>It did not come from Apple. <Sync id=""L341""time=""00:49:46""/>And so that's one of those things that kind of flowed out there, and I want to divorce Apple from that number. <Sync id=""L342""time=""00:49:55""/>We're not releasing a user number because we think that the proper way to look at it is to look at active devices. <Sync id=""L343""time=""00:50:08""/>It's also the one that is the most accurate for us to measure. <Sync id=""L344""time=""00:50:16""/>And so that's our thinking behind that. <Sync id=""L348""time=""00:50:27""/>It is so early on this product cycle, particularly with the iPhone X only starting in November that we do not feel we have data at this point that would be very meaningful to share. <Sync id=""L349""time=""00:50:45""/>And so I'll punt that question until next time around. <Sync id=""L355""time=""00:51:26""/>What I said on the investor part is I think every investor has to look at their own situation and conclude the things that they think are important. <Sync id=""L356""time=""00:51:34""/>What I think is important, I think the active devices are hugely important. <Sync id=""L357""time=""00:51:39""/>And that's the reason that we released the number 2 years ago and the reason that we're releasing that again today. <Sync id=""L358""time=""00:51:49""/>That number speaks to the strength of the product, the loyalty of the customer, the strength of the ecosystem. <Sync id=""L359""time=""00:51:57""/>And so I -- we do put a lot of weight behind that, and it obviously also fuels the services business. <Sync id=""L360""time=""00:52:06""/>So I have long believed that a 90-day clock on unit sales is a very surface way to view Apple. <Sync id=""L361""time=""00:52:17""/>I think that the far bigger thing is to look over a longer period of time. <Sync id=""L362""time=""00:52:25""/>And customer satisfaction and engagement and number of active devices are all a part of that. <Sync id=""L369""time=""00:52:51""/>HomePod is an incredible product that gives an unbelievable audio experience in a very small form factor with a super assistant -- digital assistant in Siri that knows an enormous amount about music but also can handle requests to -- like home automation to close your garage door, open your door, turn the light on, turn the fireplace on, change the thermostat, all of the things that you would like to do on home automation, that takes it further because you can do it right from the Home app and set up scenes. <Sync id=""L370""time=""00:53:35""/>So you can say, ""Hey, Siri. <Sync id=""L371""time=""00:53:37""/>I'm reading."" And your room will change to the things you would like happening in that particular room for when you read. <Sync id=""L372""time=""00:53:49""/>Maybe it's a particular light, maybe it's a type of light, maybe it's the fireplace, so on and so forth. <Sync id=""L373""time=""00:53:57""/>It also -- obviously, you can also do things with HomePod like use it as a speakerphone. <Sync id=""L374""time=""00:54:05""/>And so if you're talking to your parents or they're talking to their grandkids, it's unbelievable audio quality for speakerphone. <Sync id=""L375""time=""00:54:16""/>You can also have Siri call for you. <Sync id=""L376""time=""00:54:21""/>You can have -- you can send messages, you can get an Uber car or a Lyft car. <Sync id=""L377""time=""00:54:28""/>And so there's just a whole variety of things. <Sync id=""L378""time=""00:54:30""/>And so I think the use cases on this, much like our phones, will be broad-based. <Sync id=""L379""time=""00:54:37""/>Some people will use it significantly for music and others may use it significantly for -- as a digital assistant. <Sync id=""L380""time=""00:54:49""/>And I think the majority of people will likely use all of it and use all of the functionality of it. <Sync id=""L386""time=""00:55:23""/>Yes, Amit, it's Tim. <Sync id=""L387""time=""00:55:24""/>It's a good question. <Sync id=""L388""time=""00:55:26""/>Keep in mind that this year had 13 weeks, last year had 14 weeks. <Sync id=""L389""time=""00:55:33""/>And so even though we're recording a similar year-over-year growth for Greater China, if you change that reporting to an average weekly sales, which is probably a much better way to look at it, there was actually a really nice acceleration. <Sync id=""L390""time=""00:55:50""/>And specifically, the numbers this quarter, as reported, are 11% increase for Greater China year-over-year. <Sync id=""L391""time=""00:55:59""/>But on an average weekly revenue basis, it was -- we were up 19%. <Sync id=""L392""time=""00:56:06""/>Also mainland China, we had an all-time record for revenue in mainland China. <Sync id=""L393""time=""00:56:12""/>And of course, a key part of that was iPhone. <Sync id=""L394""time=""00:56:16""/>And as I've mentioned before, Kantar reported that the top 5 selling smartphones in urban China were all iPhones. <Sync id=""L395""time=""00:56:29""/>And so we could not be more pleased with how we're doing. <Sync id=""L396""time=""00:56:33""/>And if you look at the other -- we obviously grew share on -- for iPhone in the quarter, but we also grew share in iPad and Mac during the quarter. <Sync id=""L397""time=""00:56:46""/>And our -- and wearables were extremely strong there in the quarter. <Sync id=""L398""time=""00:56:52""/>And so everywhere I look, I feel really good about how we're doing in China. <Sync id=""L408""time=""00:57:31""/>Let me answer, Amit, starting with M&A. <Sync id=""L409""time=""00:57:37""/>Our thought process around M&A has always been the same, and it really doesn't change. <Sync id=""L410""time=""00:57:45""/>We've been acquiring companies over the years. <Sync id=""L411""time=""00:57:49""/>During -- in calendar 2017, we've acquired 19 companies. <Sync id=""L412""time=""00:57:57""/>And the thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product road maps, filling a gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers. <Sync id=""L413""time=""00:58:15""/>So it's always the customer experience in mind, right, that we make acquisitions. <Sync id=""L414""time=""00:58:19""/>We look at all sizes, and we will continue to do so. <Sync id=""L415""time=""00:58:26""/>We have plenty of financial flexibility, of course. <Sync id=""L416""time=""00:58:31""/>We had that even prior to tax reform. <Sync id=""L417""time=""00:58:35""/>And as I said, we will talk about capital allocation plans when we report the March quarter, and that will include talking about time frames and pace and so on. <Sync id=""L418""time=""00:58:50""/>And as I said, we'll try to be very thoughtful. <Sync id=""L419""time=""00:58:54""/>As you said, $163 billion is a large amount, and there are even practical considerations around it. <Sync id=""L420""time=""00:59:02""/>So we'll see. <Sync id=""L421""time=""00:59:03""/>Just for clarity, let me add one thing. <Sync id=""L422""time=""00:59:06""/>What Luca is saying is not cash equals 0. He's saying there's an equal amount of cash and debt, and that they balance to 0, just for clarity. <Sync id=""L423""time=""00:59:23""/>Thank you, Amit. <Sync id=""L424""time=""00:59:24""/>A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple podcast, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. <Sync id=""L425""time=""00:59:31""/>And the numbers for the telephone replay are (888) 203-1112 or (719) 457-0820. <Sync id=""L426""time=""00:59:42""/>And please enter confirmation code 4783460. <Sync id=""L427""time=""00:59:47""/>These replays will be available by approximately 5 p.m. <Sync id=""L428""time=""00:59:50""/>Pacific Time today. <Sync id=""L429""time=""00:59:52""/>Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at (408) 974-2414, and financial analysts can contact Matt Blake or me with additional questions. <Sync id=""L430""time=""01:00:04""/>Matt is at (408) 974-7406, and I'm at (408) 974-5420. <Sync id=""L431""time=""01:00:13""/>And thanks again for joining us.","<Sync id=""L163""time=""00:26:54""/>Luca, wanted to talk a little bit about -- more about your comments on capital structure. <Sync id=""L164""time=""00:26:57""/>I realize you don't want to give us any specifics about what you're actually going to return and the timing, but just maybe if you can talk about how much cash you -- I guess, you think you need to have to run the business. <Sync id=""L165""time=""00:27:08""/>And then in terms of ongoing cash flow, since the overseas cash will no longer be encumbered, does that change sort of your thought process in general? <Sync id=""L166""time=""00:27:21""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L180""time=""00:29:06""/>Great. <Sync id=""L181""time=""00:29:06""/>And then Tim, maybe could you talk a little bit more about what you're hearing from customers in terms of the iPhone demand? <Sync id=""L182""time=""00:29:13""/>How you're thinking about the potential decay rate, for a lack of a better term, with the high-end phones and the over $1,000 phones versus balancing that with now your ability to [shift] phones down below $400 because you'd expanded the product line so much when you launched your phones in 2017? <Sync id=""L202""time=""00:32:34""/>Growing double digits off such a large revenue base is impressive in itself, but if I look at March quarter guidance, it does assume a slower average weekly growth in total revenue as well as, I think, on my math, iPhone shipments when you compare it to the December quarter. <Sync id=""L203""time=""00:32:53""/>So just how should we read into a modest slowdown in average weekly growth as it relates to the last question around the decay of demand around the higher-priced products? <Sync id=""L204""time=""00:33:07""/>Or any impact that you might be seeing from the lower-priced battery replacements or anything else in the market? <Sync id=""L205""time=""00:33:14""/>Then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L229""time=""00:36:37""/>Yes, that's great color. <Sync id=""L230""time=""00:36:39""/>Just a follow-up on gross margin. <Sync id=""L231""time=""00:36:42""/>Guidance for flat gross margin in March is pretty seasonal, but you do have the tailwind from currency. <Sync id=""L232""time=""00:36:49""/>And so if you can just comment on how you think that flows into the model over the next couple of quarters, the weaker dollar, and what your outlook might be around component costs in the near future. <Sync id=""L242""time=""00:38:27""/>I know you don't talk about future products, which is often a preface to questions about future products, and I'll give it a shot. <Sync id=""L243""time=""00:38:33""/>When you think conceptually about the path for iPhone X style devices going forward, is there any reason the road map wouldn't consist of multiple devices as we've seen with past iPhone upgrades? <Sync id=""L244""time=""00:38:43""/>In other words, the X was unique amongst recent iPhone launches because it's a singular device, potentially limiting the shots on goal for upgrades given limited options. <Sync id=""L245""time=""00:38:52""/>How do you think about that going forward? <Sync id=""L246""time=""00:38:53""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L251""time=""00:39:28""/>All right. <Sync id=""L252""time=""00:39:31""/>And then how do you think about AR beyond iPhone? <Sync id=""L253""time=""00:39:34""/>You've created the world's largest AR platform. <Sync id=""L254""time=""00:39:36""/>You got developers generating a wide variety of apps. <Sync id=""L255""time=""00:39:39""/>I realize it's still early days, but do you see Apple as a provider of a larger ecosystem of AR-enabled device beyond iPhone and iPad in the coming years? <Sync id=""L256""time=""00:39:48""/>Or should investors focus on the opportunity within your existing device portfolio for at least the foreseeable future? <Sync id=""L266""time=""00:40:53""/>I have a question and a follow-up. <Sync id=""L267""time=""00:40:56""/>You commented on how your installed base over the last couple of years has grown 30%. <Sync id=""L268""time=""00:41:03""/>And iPhone is clearly the largest component of that. <Sync id=""L269""time=""00:41:06""/>And so iPhone installed base is probably growing close to that number, perhaps less, call it 20% or 25%. <Sync id=""L270""time=""00:41:14""/>Yet if we look at iPhone unit growth for fiscal '18, sort of what's implied with your guidance, fiscal '17 and fiscal '16, it's been relatively flat. <Sync id=""L271""time=""00:41:24""/>So you have an installed base that's 20-plus percent higher and a unit growth that's relatively flat, which would suggest that your upgrade rate is going down or your replacement cycle is elongating. <Sync id=""L272""time=""00:41:42""/>And I'm wondering whether you agree with that and whether investors should be worried about that. <Sync id=""L273""time=""00:41:49""/>And maybe if I could just add one other wrinkle to potentially get your response on is given consumers' heightened awareness of their ability to replace batteries going forward as opposed to upgrade, isn't that also something that investors should potentially be concerned about in terms of its impact on upgrade rate going forward? <Sync id=""L274""time=""00:42:13""/>And then, believe it or not, I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L292""time=""00:44:53""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L293""time=""00:44:55""/>And just a follow-up, maybe I could clarify 2 little things. <Sync id=""L294""time=""00:45:00""/>One, Luca, on tax rate, you've talked about 15% for Q2. <Sync id=""L295""time=""00:45:05""/>Is that how we should think about the tax rate on an ongoing basis? <Sync id=""L296""time=""00:45:09""/>And then just back to you on your response, Tim. <Sync id=""L297""time=""00:45:12""/>I guess, maybe you could just comment on whether you believe the upgrade rate has decreased over the last couple of years. <Sync id=""L298""time=""00:45:22""/>Because again, just sort of mechanically, installed base is growing 20% and units are relatively flat over that period. <Sync id=""L299""time=""00:45:30""/>Isn't that telling me the installed base is -- excuse me, upgrade rate is going down? <Sync id=""L300""time=""00:45:39""/>Or am I not thinking about other considerations? <Sync id=""L318""time=""00:48:16""/>I love the 1.3 billion devices you gave us, updating from 2 years ago. <Sync id=""L319""time=""00:48:20""/>And I love the on-ramp as you spread out the pricing. <Sync id=""L320""time=""00:48:23""/>Do you get the sense that we have more unique users in that 1.3 billion than we had unique users back there in 2016? <Sync id=""L324""time=""00:48:42""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L325""time=""00:48:43""/>So we have 1.3 billion (inaudible) billion (inaudible) unique users are getting fewer products so we have a higher percent of unique [users] in the 1.3 billion devices than more in the <Sync id=""L326""time=""00:48:57""/>[Audio Gap] <Sync id=""L327""time=""00:48:58""/>billion devices. <Sync id=""L328""time=""00:48:58""/>Is it a <Sync id=""L329""time=""00:49:00""/>Audio Gap <Sync id=""L330""time=""00:49:00""/>Are they <Sync id=""L331""time=""00:49:01""/>Audio Gap <Sync id=""L336""time=""00:49:27""/>Yes, I was asking as a percent, the ownership. <Sync id=""L337""time=""00:49:32""/>It used to be 1.4 devices owned per person. <Sync id=""L338""time=""00:49:36""/>Do you think it's now 1.2 or 1.6? <Sync id=""L345""time=""00:50:21""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L346""time=""00:50:22""/>Switchers in the quarter? <Sync id=""L347""time=""00:50:23""/>You often give us switchers. <Sync id=""L351""time=""00:50:59""/>Tim, you said you don't want to tell investors what to do, but the first point you made was talking about the size of the installed base. <Sync id=""L352""time=""00:51:05""/>Later, you talked about the importance of customer satisfaction. <Sync id=""L353""time=""00:51:09""/>Given that this doesn't look like a super cycle in terms of unit growth, are you nudging us to focus on the size of the installed base, the annuity opportunity here? <Sync id=""L354""time=""00:51:18""/>And do you have confidence that you can monetize that installed base through additional hardware and services? <Sync id=""L363""time=""00:52:34""/>And could you address the positioning of HomePod? <Sync id=""L364""time=""00:52:36""/>What category is it in? <Sync id=""L365""time=""00:52:38""/>Is it a music speaker? <Sync id=""L366""time=""00:52:39""/>Is it a home assistance? <Sync id=""L367""time=""00:52:40""/>Since people seem to be trying to position it versus Amazon and Google's offerings. <Sync id=""L368""time=""00:52:45""/>And is the target market primarily Apple Music users? <Sync id=""L382""time=""00:55:04""/>I have 2 questions as well. <Sync id=""L383""time=""00:55:07""/>I guess, first one, could you just touch on what you're seeing in China in terms of underlying trends right now? <Sync id=""L384""time=""00:55:12""/>I think growth was up double-digit year-over-year but essentially in line with what you saw in September. <Sync id=""L385""time=""00:55:16""/>I would have thought it would have accelerated a little bit with iPhone X. Just the puts and takes in China will be great. <Sync id=""L399""time=""00:57:00""/>Got it. <Sync id=""L400""time=""00:57:00""/>That's really helpful. <Sync id=""L401""time=""00:57:01""/>I guess, Luca, maybe a question for you. <Sync id=""L402""time=""00:57:04""/>When you talk about reducing your Apple's net cash levels to 0 effectively over time, I think that implies the number goes from $163 billion today to something like 0. I guess, what does ""over time"" mean for Apple? <Sync id=""L403""time=""00:57:16""/>Is that 1 year, 3 years, 10 years? <Sync id=""L404""time=""00:57:18""/>Just how do you define ""over time""? <Sync id=""L405""time=""00:57:20""/>And does this change your thoughts around M&A at all? <Sync id=""L406""time=""00:57:24""/>And is that one reason, you get that number from $163 billion to 0? <Sync id=""L407""time=""00:57:27""/>Does it change your M&A thought process? information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.

If you look at the -- sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the iPhone X, the 8 and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely as you can probably tell from looking at the ASP, and we couldn't be happier with how that's gone. <Sync id=""L229""time=""00:36:16""/>And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products. <Sync id=""L230""time=""00:36:25""/>And we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that, I believe, with looking at the results. <Sync id=""L231""time=""00:36:36""/>On the -- at the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter, and so -- when we changed some of the configurations -- the memory configurations in the year-ago quarter. <Sync id=""L232""time=""00:36:50""/>If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top 3 selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone X was #1 and has been for a couple of quarters. <Sync id=""L233""time=""00:37:05""/>And iPhones make up 3 of the top 5 smartphones in the U.S., U.K. and Japan. <Sync id=""L234""time=""00:37:14""/>And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market. <Sync id=""L235""time=""00:37:24""/>But given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone but iPad as well. <Sync id=""L240""time=""00:38:05""/>Yes, it's a good question. <Sync id=""L241""time=""00:38:07""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L242""time=""00:38:08""/>This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double-digit growth in Greater China. <Sync id=""L243""time=""00:38:16""/>I mentioned how iPhone X and sort of the iPhones were selling. <Sync id=""L244""time=""00:38:21""/>We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad. <Sync id=""L245""time=""00:38:24""/>But if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had a double-digit growth from Services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category, which the Watch did extremely well. <Sync id=""L246""time=""00:38:38""/>And so there are lots of good things happening there. <Sync id=""L247""time=""00:38:43""/>In terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back because I'm sure that a lot -- some people have questions on this. <Sync id=""L248""time=""00:38:52""/>And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and -- sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences. <Sync id=""L249""time=""00:39:17""/>That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between -- between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex, and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing. <Sync id=""L250""time=""00:39:32""/>But we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that, and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth. <Sync id=""L251""time=""00:39:46""/>In terms of the tariffs that have been imposed or have exited the comment period, I think that there's one that's exiting today, there have been 3 of those. <Sync id=""L252""time=""00:39:59""/>And maybe I could walk through those briefly just to make sure everybody's on the same page. <Sync id=""L253""time=""00:40:03""/>The first was the U.S. imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum that was -- many, many different countries, that started, I believe, at the beginning of June. <Sync id=""L254""time=""00:40:15""/>There have been 2 other tariffs that have totaled about $50 billion of goods from China that have either been implemented or are exiting the comment period in this month. <Sync id=""L255""time=""00:40:29""/>I think the latest one is today. <Sync id=""L256""time=""00:40:33""/>If you look at those 3 tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs. <Sync id=""L257""time=""00:40:42""/>There is a fourth tariff, which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China. <Sync id=""L258""time=""00:40:54""/>That one is out for public comment. <Sync id=""L259""time=""00:40:56""/>Probably like everyone else, we're evaluating that one, and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comment period for that one ends. <Sync id=""L260""time=""00:41:09""/>It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue. <Sync id=""L261""time=""00:41:28""/>Maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing. <Sync id=""L262""time=""00:41:32""/>And so we're going through that now, and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back from the comment. <Sync id=""L263""time=""00:41:46""/>Of course, the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue, such as an economic slowdown in one or more countries or currency fluctuations that are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify. <Sync id=""L264""time=""00:42:00""/>And so that -- and we're not even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it. <Sync id=""L265""time=""00:42:07""/>All of this said, we're optimistic, as I've been the whole time, that this will get sorted out because there's an inescapable mutuality with -- between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together. <Sync id=""L266""time=""00:42:25""/>Each country can only prosper if the other does. <Sync id=""L267""time=""00:42:28""/>And of course, the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper, for the world to do well. <Sync id=""L268""time=""00:42:38""/>That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this. <Sync id=""L269""time=""00:42:49""/>And we are hoping that calm heads prevail. <Sync id=""L274""time=""00:43:38""/>Yes, sure, Brian. <Sync id=""L275""time=""00:43:38""/>Thanks for the question. <Sync id=""L276""time=""00:43:41""/>We're very excited to work with Oprah. <Sync id=""L277""time=""00:43:43""/>We think that her incomparable ability and talent to connect with audiences around the world are -- there's no match. <Sync id=""L278""time=""00:43:53""/>And we think that we can do some great original content together, and so we could not be happier in working with Oprah. <Sync id=""L279""time=""00:44:05""/>As you know, we hired 2 highly respected television executives last year, and they have been here now for several months and have been working on a project that we're not really ready to share the -- all the details about it yet. <Sync id=""L280""time=""00:44:27""/>But I couldn't be more excited about what's going on there. <Sync id=""L281""time=""00:44:33""/>And we've got great talent in the area that we've sourced from different places and feel really good about -- felt really good about what we will eventually offer. <Sync id=""L282""time=""00:44:49""/>In terms of the sort of the key catalysts and the changes -- the cord-cutting, in our view, is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate at a much faster rate than is widely thought. <Sync id=""L283""time=""00:45:07""/>We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this like Apple TV units and revenue grew by very strong double digits, very, very strong double digits in Q3. <Sync id=""L284""time=""00:45:23""/>As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers pick up the Apple TV and use it as their box to go to market with their subscription service. <Sync id=""L285""time=""00:45:40""/>There are -- within the 300 million-plus paid subscriptions, some of these are third-party video subscriptions, and we see the growth that is going on there. <Sync id=""L286""time=""00:45:53""/>It's like 100% year-over-year. <Sync id=""L287""time=""00:45:57""/>And so all the things from a -- all the forcing functions here from the outside all point to dramatic changes speeding up in the content industry. <Sync id=""L288""time=""00:46:15""/>And so we're really happy to be working on something but just not ready to talk about it in, in depth today. <Sync id=""L289""time=""00:46:25""/>In terms of Apple Music, we're well over 50 million listeners now when you add the -- our paid subscribers and the folks in the trial. <Sync id=""L290""time=""00:46:41""/>And so we're moving along at a very, very good rate. <Sync id=""L291""time=""00:46:47""/>It appears to us and what we've been told is that we took the leadership position in North America during the quarter, and we had leadership position in Japan. <Sync id=""L292""time=""00:47:05""/>And so in some of the markets that we've been in for a long period of time, we're doing quite well. <Sync id=""L293""time=""00:47:17""/>But really, the key thing in Music is not the competition between companies that are providing music, it's the -- the real challenge is to grow the market because if you add everyone up that's providing subscription music today or streaming music, it's -- outside of China, it's less than 200 million probably around the world. <Sync id=""L294""time=""00:47:45""/>And so it does seem to me, there's an extraordinary opportunity in that business to grow the market well. <Sync id=""L295""time=""00:47:54""/>And I think if we put our emphasis there, which we're doing, that -- we'll be a beneficiary of that as other people will as well. <Sync id=""L296""time=""00:48:07""/>But I like where we are. <Sync id=""L297""time=""00:48:10""/>Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50%, as I'd mentioned earlier, during the quarter. <Sync id=""L298""time=""00:48:17""/>And so it's really, really strong, strong results. <Sync id=""L299""time=""00:48:26""/>Thanks for the question. <Sync id=""L305""time=""00:49:03""/>Toni, as you know, we do not provide guidance for either units or ASPs for any product category. <Sync id=""L306""time=""00:49:16""/>But of course, we provide a guidance on revenue. <Sync id=""L307""time=""00:49:18""/>And the guidance range implies growth of 16% to 19%. <Sync id=""L308""time=""00:49:25""/>We expect the growth to come from strong growth from iPhone, from Services and from Wearables, which has been a bit of our pattern during the course of the year. <Sync id=""L309""time=""00:49:38""/>On iPhone ASP, the only thing that I would point out is that, obviously, we're exiting the June quarter at a significantly higher level than in the past. <Sync id=""L310""time=""00:49:49""/>And so that, I think it's important to keep in mind -- as we move into the September quarter, it's important to keep in mind the type of revenue growth that we've implied in our guidance. <Sync id=""L316""time=""00:50:52""/>I think the smartphone market is very healthy. <Sync id=""L317""time=""00:50:56""/>I think it's actually the best market in the world to be in for someone that is in the business that we're in. <Sync id=""L318""time=""00:51:05""/>So it's an enormous-sized market and whether it grows -- from our point of view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 2%, it's a great market because it's just huge. <Sync id=""L319""time=""00:51:26""/>And so that's kind of the way that I view that. <Sync id=""L320""time=""00:51:30""/>iPhone revenues are up 20% for the quarter over last year. <Sync id=""L321""time=""00:51:38""/>We're really pleased with that. <Sync id=""L322""time=""00:51:39""/>And if you look at the sort of this cycle, which I'll define as Q1, Q2, Q3 for ease, you'll see that we've grown like mid-single digits and -- on an average weekly sales point of view and, of course, double-digit on ASP. <Sync id=""L323""time=""00:52:02""/>And so I think it's really healthy. <Sync id=""L324""time=""00:52:06""/>In terms of replacement cycles, as I've mentioned I think on a previous call, some replacement cycles are lengthening. <Sync id=""L325""time=""00:52:16""/>I think that the major catalyst for that was probably the subsidy plans becoming a much smaller percentage of total sales around the world than they were at one time. <Sync id=""L326""time=""00:52:36""/>And so I think that some are lengthening and -- but I think for us, the thing that we always have to do is come out with a really great innovative product. <Sync id=""L327""time=""00:52:47""/>And I think that iPhone X shows that when you deliver great innovative product, there's enough people there that would like that, and it can be a really good business. <Sync id=""L328""time=""00:52:59""/>And so that's how I look at that. <Sync id=""L329""time=""00:53:02""/>In terms of the -- our installed base, which is something very important for us as it is one of the key drivers of Services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double digits over last year during the quarter. <Sync id=""L330""time=""00:53:22""/>And so we're thrilled with that. <Sync id=""L331""time=""00:53:24""/>And you can see that carrying through to the Services line, in the -- and the growth that we have there. <Sync id=""L332""time=""00:53:31""/>In terms of batteries, we have never done an analysis internally about how many people decided to get a lower-priced battery than buy another phone because it was never about that for us. <Sync id=""L333""time=""00:53:46""/>It was always about doing something great for the user. <Sync id=""L334""time=""00:53:51""/>And I think if you treat the users and customers well, then you have a good business over time, and so that's how we look at that. <Sync id=""L337""time=""00:54:15""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L338""time=""00:54:16""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L345""time=""00:54:52""/>I think the home business, Laura, is bigger than the HomePod and Apple TV. <Sync id=""L346""time=""00:54:59""/>They're both important products clearly. <Sync id=""L347""time=""00:55:03""/>But everybody has their iPhone at home as well and everybody has their Mac at home and everyone has their iPad at home. <Sync id=""L348""time=""00:55:10""/>And so in terms of the -- Siri access points, there -- as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions. <Sync id=""L349""time=""00:55:31""/>I do that every day with controlling all my home automation and so on and so forth. <Sync id=""L350""time=""00:55:36""/>Part of that is on HomePod, but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad. <Sync id=""L351""time=""00:55:45""/>And so I think home is important. <Sync id=""L352""time=""00:55:47""/>Home is important. <Sync id=""L353""time=""00:55:48""/>Work is important. <Sync id=""L354""time=""00:55:49""/>The movement between the 2 are important. <Sync id=""L355""time=""00:55:54""/>Health is important. <Sync id=""L356""time=""00:55:56""/>So the smartphone has become the repository that goes across the whole of your life, not something that is just meant for a portion of it. <Sync id=""L357""time=""00:56:08""/>And so I think all of those are important, and we're focused on all of them. <Sync id=""L358""time=""00:56:13""/>Thanks for your question. <Sync id=""L367""time=""00:56:59""/>The -- a lot of people that buy Apple products buy for the whole ecosystem even though they might not currently use all the different products. <Sync id=""L368""time=""00:57:15""/>And so the way that I think about those products are they're products within the ecosystem itself. <Sync id=""L369""time=""00:57:22""/>And there's a -- the AirPods have really gone through the roof, and the Apple Watch has hit an air pocket and has gone to a whole different level, as I had mentioned earlier, with our overall Wearables revenue. <Sync id=""L370""time=""00:57:41""/>And so in my view, this is a part of the -- they are a core part of the ecosystem. <Sync id=""L373""time=""00:57:55""/>It is -- well, but on your point though, it is clear from communications that I've had with users that some of them were attracted to iPhone because of the Apple Watch. <Sync id=""L374""time=""00:58:09""/>And so the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone. <Sync id=""L375""time=""00:58:12""/>The reverse of that is also true is that somebody got the iPhone and then decided, ""I really want something to coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth like the Watch does so well."" And so it's not always a linear path. <Sync id=""L376""time=""00:58:35""/>I see these things as being somewhat fluid and different for each user. <Sync id=""L380""time=""00:58:47""/>Exactly right. <Sync id=""L381""time=""00:58:48""/>Thank you for the questions. <Sync id=""L382""time=""00:58:51""/>Thank you, Laura. <Sync id=""L383""time=""00:58:52""/>A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple podcast, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. <Sync id=""L384""time=""00:59:01""/>And the numbers for the telephone replay are (888) 203-1112 or (719) 457-0820. <Sync id=""L385""time=""00:59:11""/>Please enter confirmation code 5838188. <Sync id=""L386""time=""00:59:15""/>And these replays will be available by approximately 5 p.m. <Sync id=""L387""time=""00:59:18""/>Pacific Time today. <Sync id=""L388""time=""00:59:20""/>Members of the press with additional questions can contact Josh Rosenstock at (408) 862-1142. <Sync id=""L389""time=""00:59:27""/>And financial analysts can contact Matt Blake or me with additional questions. <Sync id=""L390""time=""00:59:31""/>Matt is at (408) 974-7406, and I'm at (408) 974-5420. <Sync id=""L391""time=""00:59:39""/>Thanks again for joining us.","<Sync id=""L181""time=""00:29:22""/>I'll ask both my questions upfront. <Sync id=""L182""time=""00:29:24""/>First, for Tim, you're on track to hit your Services revenue target even earlier than planned. <Sync id=""L183""time=""00:29:31""/>So how are you thinking about the next legs of Services growth as you move into the next 3 to 5 years? <Sync id=""L184""time=""00:29:40""/>And then for you Luca, NAND prices are falling this year. <Sync id=""L185""time=""00:29:44""/>Services mix is rising. <Sync id=""L186""time=""00:29:46""/>Those should both positively influence gross margins. <Sync id=""L187""time=""00:29:49""/>And yet, we're seeing gross margin sort of hang out here at 38%. <Sync id=""L188""time=""00:29:54""/>What are the offsetting headwinds? <Sync id=""L189""time=""00:29:57""/>And is it possible that we could see the tailwinds start to overpower those headwinds in the next couple of quarters and see gross margins drift higher? <Sync id=""L219""time=""00:34:30""/>Tim, can you talk a bit about trends within your iPhone sales? <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:34:33""/>ASPs were above expectations. <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:34:37""/>And now that you've had -- and that was clearly better than some of the comments from some of your competitors. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:34:42""/>Now that you've had about 9 months of experience with the high-end fully featured phone, can you talk a bit about what you think customers want, what the elasticity of demand is and how you're sort of thinking about your competitive position? <Sync id=""L223""time=""00:34:55""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L236""time=""00:37:44""/>Great. <Sync id=""L237""time=""00:37:44""/>And then can you talk a bit about China, up 19% -- Greater China, up 19% year-over-year during the quarter, I believe? <Sync id=""L238""time=""00:37:52""/>Obviously, iPhone doing well, but -- there was some concern that maybe some of what's going on in the trade world might have impacted, it doesn't seem like that. <Sync id=""L239""time=""00:38:00""/>So I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in China and how you're thinking about it as you look forward. <Sync id=""L271""time=""00:43:16""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L272""time=""00:43:17""/>Tim, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the multiyear partnership with Oprah Winfrey and what that says about your original content strategy. <Sync id=""L273""time=""00:43:27""/>And also Apple Music, if you can give us a little more color, sort of an update maybe around paid subscribers or total subscribers around Apple Music and how you feel that's rolled out. <Sync id=""L301""time=""00:48:36""/>I have one for Luca and one for Tim, please. <Sync id=""L302""time=""00:48:41""/>Luca, I'm wondering, as we think about modeling Q4, iPhone ASPs are typically up sequentially about 2% to 4%, sort of low single digits. <Sync id=""L303""time=""00:48:55""/>Perhaps you can help us think through how we should be thinking about Q4. <Sync id=""L304""time=""00:48:59""/>I know you provided some commentary last quarter on how we should be thinking about Q3 ASPs. <Sync id=""L311""time=""00:50:04""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L312""time=""00:50:05""/>Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit about the health of the smartphone market. <Sync id=""L313""time=""00:50:12""/>Apple's smartphone iPhone units have been relatively flat for 4 years. <Sync id=""L314""time=""00:50:19""/>And I think you've probably been a share gainer during the period, which would suggest, at least at the high end of the market, that is perhaps flat to down. <Sync id=""L315""time=""00:50:28""/>And I'm wondering if you can comment on, a, whether you believe that and what you think might be happening with replacement cycles and specifically also what impact, if any, you've seen from wider availability and less expensive replacement batteries for iPhones. <Sync id=""L336""time=""00:54:08""/>Yes, can you hear me okay? <Sync id=""L339""time=""00:54:16""/>Great, okay. <Sync id=""L340""time=""00:54:17""/>Super. <Sync id=""L341""time=""00:54:17""/>I'd like to focus on product road map and strategy. <Sync id=""L342""time=""00:54:20""/>There is a war going on for the home, the connected home, over the Internet of Things. <Sync id=""L343""time=""00:54:25""/>And with 2 products, the HomePod and Apple TV in the home, my question is, strategically, how do you feel about the importance of being in the home and whether it threatens your dominance outside the home, with your core business in the mobile devices, if you sort of lose that battle? <Sync id=""L344""time=""00:54:43""/>I'm just trying to figure out strategically, when you think about where the puck's going, how important is it for you to have a beachhead in the home as well as out of home? <Sync id=""L359""time=""00:56:17""/>That's helpful actually. <Sync id=""L360""time=""00:56:19""/>Yes, sort of. <Sync id=""L361""time=""00:56:20""/>I mean, I'll watch your product road map and be able to tell what the answer is. <Sync id=""L362""time=""00:56:24""/>The other thing, the thing I get in fights with investors about the most is this, and I'd love your insight on this. <Sync id=""L363""time=""00:56:30""/>I love the expansion of the new products. <Sync id=""L364""time=""00:56:32""/>The question I have is, are they actually on-ramped into the Apple ecosystem, the Beats, the Watch, the AirPods, subscriptions? <Sync id=""L365""time=""00:56:42""/>Are they on-ramped into the ecosystem? <Sync id=""L366""time=""00:56:45""/>Or is the on-ramp to the ecosystem the iPhone, and then these new products add revenue per member once you get somebody into the ecosystem via the iPhone? <Sync id=""L371""time=""00:57:47""/>And so they attract a new person to the ecosystem. <Sync id=""L372""time=""00:57:52""/>Or does the person have to have an iPhone first? <Sync id=""L377""time=""00:58:41""/>So they're complementary and self-reinforcing. <Sync id=""L378""time=""00:58:45""/>Okay, that makes sense. <Sync id=""L379""time=""00:58:46""/>All right. information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.

As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 14% year-over-year on iPhone, and that's a combination of single-digit unit growth and ASP growth that is mainly driven by iPhone X. I think that our iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market that is as large as the smartphone market, and so we're going to continue to provide different iPhones to -- for folks to meet their needs. On iPhone X specifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments that customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the March quarter just as they did following the -- following its launch in the December quarter. Also, since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in 2014, this is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular. And so with the customer sat that Luca referenced as well, the 99%, the iPhone X is a beloved product, and so it's -- I think that it's one of those things where like a team wins the Super Bowl. Maybe you want them to win by a few more points, but it's a Super Bowl winner. And that's how we feel about it. I could not be prouder of the product. Yes. Shannon, you know that we've always generated a significant amount of cash through working capital. We've got a negative cash conversion cycle, and we plan to continue to have that. Our inventory level has gone up. It's just a temporary event. We have decided to make some purchasing decision given current market conditions, and that should unwind over time. Correct. It's Tim. The -- Services grew 31%. We hit an all-time record at $9.2 billion, first time we cleared $9 billion. The great news about it is it's not a single geo or a single service. If you look at it, each of the geos, the minimum was at 25%. So each of the geos were -- had -- did extremely well, and we set records from the App Store to the Apple Music, to iCloud, to Apple Pay and more. And underneath that, if you look at the subscriptions, the number of subscriptions, I think I mentioned this in my comments, paid subscriptions have moved up over 100 million on a year-over-year basis to over 270 million by the end of the quarter. And so it's very broad based in terms of type of service and geographic region. It's sort of exactly what we would like to see. In terms of forecasting moving forward, we've obviously made assumption for our guidance that Luca provided earlier, and in terms of longer term, we're on target to our 2020 goal of doubling the Services revenue of '16 as we had talked about previously. Yes. I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins, and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win. And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together. And I'm actually very optimistic. I think history shows us that countries that embrace openness and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed. And so I'm a big believer that the 2 countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently. And so that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that -- I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail. Well, Mike, it's Tim. The -- again, the great thing about Services is there are several services that make up the total that are growing nicely. And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base has -- is at such a level at -- last quarter, we said that we had exceeded $1.3 billion. This year, we're -- we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again. And it's growing at a double-digit number on a year-over-year basis. And so with that kind of change in the installed base and with the services that we have now and others that we are working on, I think that this is just a huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we're on. A good question. IPhone X was the most popular smartphone in all of China last quarter. And so iPhone X has done well there. In order to hit a number like 21% on the growth that you see on your data sheet there, there has to be several things working well. And the things that have huge growth rates there are the other products category, which is our Wearables business in China and the Services business, which you and I just spoke about. The iPhone obviously had to do extremely well to get a 21% number, and we gained share in the market for the Mac as well. And so there's actually several vectors there that are working well for us. We also -- more broadly on the iPhone, the iPhone was the top 3 selling phones in China. And so it's iPhone X was #1, but we had several in the top. Yes. Amit, it's Luca. We tend to look at the -- our gross margin dynamics on a sequential basis, and essentially, we're guiding to about flat on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it's less relevant for our business, but in general, I would say that this year we are seeing a more difficult cost environment. Particularly, we're still dealing with about 70 basis points of the impact from the memory pricing environment that we're working through. We protect it by encrypting it, and we keep the bulk of information or a significant amount of information on the device so that the user is in control of it. We also collect much less overall than others do because our -- if you look at our model, if we can convince you to buy an iPhone or an iPad, we'll make a little bit of money. You're not our product, and so that's how we look at that. In terms of benefit, we don't really view it like that. We view that privacy is a fundamental human right and that it's an extremely complex situation if you're a user to understand a lot of the user agreements and so forth. And we've always viewed that part of our role was to sort of make things as simple as possible for the user and provide them a level of privacy and security. And so that's how we'd look at it. Yes. Let's start with the dividend. We're increasing it by 16%. This is the largest increase that we've done since we've reintroduced the dividend back in August of 2012. So we think it's a very meaningful increase for all the investors that value income. Obviously, when we come down to capital allocation decisions, we obviously also keep in mind that -- the opportunity for us to do some M&A activities, which we do in an ongoing basis. But when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that for a variety of reasons, the -- we see a lot of value in the stock. We believe the stock is undervalued, and so we have a bias towards the buyback. So the dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends. But we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily. We are not giving an end date to the program this time because the amount is very, very large. And so we will -- we would try to execute it. As you've seen from our track record during the last 5 years, we will do that at a very fast pace. But we also want to do it efficiently. We want to make sure that we buy back the stock at the right time. And so with that in mind, we have done $23.5 billion of repurchases during the March quarter. We will give you an update to our activities at the end of every quarter. And then 12 months from now we will actually talk about an update to the entire program. So you will be able to keep track of our progress every 90 days. We think about it very broadly, and you can tell that a bit by some of the things that we've had going with ResearchKit and CareKit and most recently, the health records that I had referenced in my initial comments. And those all came out of getting significantly engaged in the Apple Watch and sort of pulling the strings so to speak. And we also have a Heart Study that is going on currently. And so I don't want to give too much away, but it's an area of great interest where we think we can make a big difference. And so it's a major strategic thrust of ours. Yes, good question. Let me start with India, and then I'll talk more about China. India, we set a new first half record. So we continue to put great energy there and try to -- our objective over time is to go in there with all of our different initiatives from retail and everything else. And so we're working toward those things. It's a huge market, and it's clear that many people will be moving into the middle class over time as we've seen in other countries. China, I continue to believe is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity from a market point of view but also lots of opportunity from an app developer point of view. We have almost 2 million application developers in China that are writing apps for iOS and the App Store, and they're doing unbelievably creative work and innovative work. And so we sort of -- we look at China holistically, not only as a market. On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as being the top-selling smartphone during the quarter. We gained share during the quarter. And I read some notes here and there about the market itself not being good. I think on -- in any kind of -- on a 90-day clock, lots of different things can happen, but my own personal view of China is that it's a great market. And I would -- I'm -- we are certainly looking far beyond 90 days and feel very bullish on the opportunity and the environment there. I would say that the market for us is more than iPhone. The Mac gained share there as well. The Watch is getting some traction there. Services is doing extremely well. And so it has several catalysts, and I'm very pleased with the results that we were able to show during the quarter. Tim, can you comment on the price elasticity of demand at the high end for iPhones, if that was in line with your expectations? Do you have a preference for unit growth versus ASP growth when it comes to maximizing the gross profit dollar growth? And I have a follow-up for Luca, please. We price for the value that we're delivering. And iPhone X is the most innovative product on the market, and as I've said a few times, we have -- they're sort of jam-packed with technologies that really set up the smartphone for the next decade. And so that's how we priced it. We were surprised somewhat that through all of this period of time that the iPhone X winds up at the most selling -- most popular for every week of the time since the launch, and so that's, I think, a powerful point. And it's #1 in China, which is another powerful point. And so obviously, at some point, if those technologies move to lower price points and that -- there's probably more unit demand. But the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver, and I feel that we did that. And Luca, your gross margins have been very robust despite the headwinds that you absorbed on commodities, which you quantified, and frankly, also from the FX hedges that are limiting some of the FX upside that a lot of other companies are seeing. So as you -- one, when do you expect these to turn into tailwinds? And when they do turn into tailwinds, do you -- would you consider reinvesting some of those into pricing? Or would you -- like should we think about you flowing those through to the bottom line? Well, Wamsi, I think let me start with where we are right now. I think you're right. I think we've been able to navigate a difficult foreign exchange environment for a number of years. And now as you know, because we have this hedging program, as the dollar has weakened a bit in recent months, although during the last week, it actually started to turn the other way again, we've got the hedging program that works both ways. And also on the memory front, we feel that for NAND, we're going to be turning the corner very soon. For DRAM, we also think that we are near the peak, possibly at the end of this year. And so that should provide some level of stability. As I said earlier this year, I think we are experiencing in total a more difficult cost environment. And so hopefully, that can turn into a positive for us. At the same time, it's very difficult for me to give you an indication of what is going to happen in the future because every product cycle is different, and as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter. There are some elements that we understand quite well and we tend to manage well over the course of the cycle, for example, our cost structures that we are able to manage during -- throughout the year. But there are also elements that are not entirely under our control like foreign exchange. And the mix of products and services that we sell to our customers also has an impact on the overall gross margin. Our primary consideration is always around maximizing gross margin dollars, and that is the approach that we take around, for example, pricing decisions. And I'll ask actually both my questions at the same time, one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, strategically, when we talk to investors, they often say, ""Oh, iPhone market is saturated. There's not much room for growth."" Yet when we do our analysis, we kind of still see emerging markets like India and all those still a growth. When you think about India and those markets, do you kind of believe that some of those markets could get to much higher or a more normalized market share that you have in some of the developing countries over time? And can you talk a little bit about some of those efforts you may be doing? And then, Luca, the question for you is about the gross margin. When we think about if component prices start to stabilize, seeing how Apple Services have been so successful and accretive to margins, should we start to look for some potential margin -- gross margin upside, again, should components stabilize? Yes. Jim, thanks for the question. In terms of the -- let me address the smartphone market a bit, and then I'll mention iPhone. In terms of the market in general, if you look at last year, which was the last data point we have on the full market, was -- there were still 0.5 billion feature phones sold in the world. Now many of those were sold into emerging markets, not all of them but many of them, and we still believe that, over time, every phone sold will be a smartphone. And so it seems to us that with that many feature phones being sold, that's a pretty big opportunity. In terms of the iPhone itself, even though we sell quite a few phones across the course of a year, our market share globally is low compared to the -- our sales are low compared to the full market of smartphones. And so the -- our task is to convince people that currently -- or have another type of phone to switch while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose, when they elect to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone. And so we spend quite a bit of time on that as you might guess. I do think that India -- India is the third largest smartphone market in the world. There's obviously huge opportunities there for us, and we have extremely large share in that market overall. And so we're putting a lot of energy there and working with the carriers in that market. And they're investing enormously on the LTE networks, and the infrastructure has come quite a way since we began to put a lot of energy in there because of their leadership and so forth. And so I do think -- I don't buy the view that the market's saturated. I don't see that from a market point of view or -- and certainly not from an iPhone point of view. I think the smartphone market is sort of like the best market for a consumer product company in the history of the world. And so that's how I feel about it. It's a terrific market, and we're very happy to be a part of it. Jim, on the gross margin side, I think I'll repeat what I said earlier, but we -- you're right. Our Services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive to company margins, and so as we're able to grow the Services business, that should provide a positive, a tailwind. At the same time, within the Services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling. At a macro level, because about 2/3 of our company is outside the United States, a weak dollar is a positive for our gross margins. A strong dollar, as it's been during the last 4 years, has been a bit of a headwind for the company. We try to make it more stable through the hedging program. And in general, when we look at our process to innovate our products, typically, when we launch a new product, that product tends to have a higher cost structure than the product it replaces. And so that is something that we need to work through every time we launch a new product, and we have a pretty good track record and history of taking those cost structures down over time. So we need to balance all these different elements. I think we've done a pretty remarkable job during the last several years at managing all these different variables and coming up with a level of gross margins that we think is really good for investors. And certainly, it is our plan to continue to manage them that way, but it's very difficult for me to give you a prediction of where gross margins are going to be 6 months or 12 months from now.

Now that we're a couple of quarters out from the launch of the iPhone X, given the $1,000 price point, it's clearly selling, but there's been a lot of questions in the market about sustainability of that price point and how you're thinking about it as you go look out sort of holistically across your lineup. So if you could talk a bit about what you're hearing from your customers on that and then I have a follow-up. And then, Luca, can you talk about working capital, specifically inventory, which went up pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter? What's driving that? And how are you thinking about -- I mean, it's one of the uses of cash obviously. So how are you thinking about inventory and maybe working capital in general as you're going forward? So that was essentially component purchases? The Services growth acceleration is really the highlight this quarter in my mind. Can you talk about what the biggest driver is, whether it be products or regions that drove the acceleration? And do you think that we can continue to see growth north of 30%? Then, I have a follow-up. And it doesn't look like the threat of a trade war with China slowed down that business. In fact, growth accelerated. But anything anecdotally that you see in the business in recent weeks that would suggest that, that is having an impact on demand? And any actions that Apple is taking as a company to preempt any risk of tariffs going forward? Just following on the Services question. I'd be curious what the next drivers of Services revenue are? Will it be continued penetration of Music and Pay that you see as kind of the largest future categories of incremental growth? Or maybe when could augmented reality become a material part of Services? And then I have a follow-up. And then any potential tariff issues aside, what's working for Apple in China right now? You talked about it being the strongest year-over-year growth in 10 quarters. I guess, what's driving that? Is it iPhone X specifically or something else that's behind that improvement? Two questions from me as well. I guess, first one, just touching on the gross margin dynamics. If I look at the guidance for June on a year-over-year basis, I think sales are up double digit, but gross margins are still flat at the high end, maybe down 20 basis points at the midpoint. Can you just talk about what's driving the lack of leverage on the gross margin basis on a year-over-year basis for June? Got it. And if I could just follow up, Tim, you've been fairly vocal, I think, talking about the need for better privacy protection and well-crafted regulation over time. Could you just maybe help us understand how does Apple protect consumer data? And how does this ongoing debate around data protection translate into a positive for Apple over time? Luca, could you talk a bit more about the capital allocation? The dividend increase of 16% was relatively low relative to what you could have done. So are you really thinking the stock price is attractive here? And you said you would execute the buyback at a fast pace. Can you give us any time frame of that $100 billion? And how much debt do you think about in terms of net cash 0? And Tim, could you talk a bit about your health care opportunity? Is it merely selling watches over time? Or do you think more broadly about? Is there a services play? You're doing some things for your employees. Could that potentially broaden out? How do you think about the opportunity there? Yes. Tim, I think there's -- China numbers were actually phenomenal in the quarter and third consecutive quarter of growth. I think there's been a lot of concerns, just Apple in China and maybe misinformation out there. But what do you see as the drivers for Apple in both Mainland China and Greater China over the next few years? And also, if you could just give us an update on what you're seeing in India. information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.

Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch at the end of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018. This year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history. In fiscal year '18, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year. And we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever. Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in 3 years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, Services and Wearables drove our momentum, and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments. It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X and the very successful launch of iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max. These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple-designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second. The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward. It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition using real-time machine learning to transform the way we experience photo, gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual-camera system that shoots portrait mode photos with Smart HDR and dynamic depth of field, and Face ID is even faster. The response has been powerful. As one reviewer put it, ""iPhone Xs and Xs Max are the perfect blend of design and craftsmanship as well as seamlessly intuitive user experience."" We're not done yet. Just last week, we began shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone breakthroughs to even more users. With an all-screen glass and aluminum design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews had been overwhelmingly positive. iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been installed on more systems in its first month than any version of iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering system-wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts and new tools to help people reduce interruption and manage screen time for themselves and their kids. Siri Shortcuts, in particular, is already deeply integrated with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you're tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure all of your most relevant apps are working together with Siri in the driver seat. iOS 12 also features ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi-user experiences and real-world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS devices deliver the best AR experiences of any products in the market today, and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we've made that gap even wider. More powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivaled in its versatility and performance. And paired with the beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-size smart keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and productivity device. And finally, just this week, we delivered the hotly anticipated group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime-enabled devices. For Services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue at $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable onetime accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our Services growth was 27%. We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions, reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem. I want to spotlight the exceptional performance of Apple Pay, which is, by far, the #1 mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year, and to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal mobile with over 4x the growth rate. As a testament to accelerating U.S. growth, Costco completed the rollout of Apple Pay to over 500 U.S. warehouses last quarter, while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country. With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations support Apple Pay. We continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launch of student ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy. We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season. In September, we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to Mac like dark mode, stack and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. Considered alongside the release of iOS 12, watchOS 5 and a new tvOS, macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week, we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new MacBook Air brings a stunning Retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more portable design to the world's most beloved notebook. We also unveiled the biggest update ever to Mac mini, the small yet muscular desktop that powers everything from the music and sound effects of Broadway shows to the developers who build some of the most popular apps in the App Store. The new Mac mini boasts an amazing 5x faster performance than before. With revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of people's lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all-new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor. Later this year, the ECG app will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the U.S., giving them the ability to take an electrocardiogram anytime right from their wrists. And for U.S. customers with Apple Watch Series 1 and later, watchOS will soon enable periodic checks for irregular heart rhythms that may be suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and potentially life changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an intelligent guardian for your health. More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space, and we look forward to making more in the future. We are proud to bring HomePod to new customers. I was in Spain last week as HomePod became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the highest fidelity audio quality, working together with an Apple Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room in your home. Our retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to connect, learn and be inspired together with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are a terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices. Apple Stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp. The relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China and in just a few weeks, Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside United States. Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on 2 items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making the world a better place. First, education. More than 5,000 schools, community colleges and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity and passion for technology's potential aren't limited by ZIP code or country, and we don't think opportunity should be either. We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring designed to help unleash kids' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad. Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a strong, durable and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple. This is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful solutions that set us apart. I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever, and we could not be more bullish about Apple's future. And now Luca has more details to share with you on the September quarter. Luca? Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and Wearables and new all-time records for Services and Mac. Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially in line with our expectations as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS and cash flow from operations. Net income was $14.1 billion, up $3.4 billion or 32% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.91, up 41%. Cash flow from operations was $19.5 billion, up $3.8 billion from a year ago. iPhone revenue grew 29% with growth of more than 20% in every geographic segment. iPhone ASP was $793 compared to $618 a year ago, driven by strong performance of iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus as well as the successful launch of iPhone Xs and Xs Max in the September quarter this year, while we launched iPhone X in the December quarter last year. We sold 46.9 million iPhones during the quarter with growth of 20% or more in several markets, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Chile and Vietnam. Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to Services. It was our best quarter ever in total and virtually in every market around the world with revenue of $10 billion. A year ago, we had a onetime $640 million favorable impact to Services revenue due to an accounting adjustment, and taking that into account, our Services growth in Q4 this year was 27%. As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue records for many Services categories, and we are well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 Services revenue by 2020. We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our platform, an increase of over 50% versus a year ago. We are very pleased not only with the growth but also with the breadth of our subscription business. In fact, 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available in the App Store today, and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total Services revenue. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July with strong double-digit revenue growth driving an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue. We were especially pleased with Mac momentum in emerging markets with strong growth in Latin America, in India, the Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Macs is at an all-time high, and the majority of customer purchasing Macs in the September quarter were new to Mac. We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in nearly every market we track based on the latest estimates from IDC. We generated iPad growth in a number of key regions around the world, including Latin America, Europe, Japan, India and South Asia. Among customers around the world purchasing iPads during the quarter, nearly half were new to iPad, and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high. NPD indicates that iPad had 58% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, up from 54% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 96% for both iPad and iPad Pro. And among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, 74% plan to purchase iPads. Other products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter record with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago, thanks to Wearables growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV in addition to the introduction of HomePod earlier this year. As we look back across fiscal 2018, we have made great progress in the enterprise market, where iOS is transforming how business gets done across multiple industries. In fact, over 450 airlines and 47 of the top 50 around the world have adopted iOS to help pilots fly safer, more efficient flights. And many airlines are also using iOS to support better customer experiences and improve maintenance operations. We're also making great strides in the retail sector, where 9 of the top 10 global retailers use iOS devices to transform their customer and employee experiences. We are seeing industry-wide adoption of iOS at thousands of retailers from neighborhood boutiques to many of the best-known retailers in the world. Deployment of iOS devices is growing steadily as retailers replace their traditional point-of-sale systems and use custom iOS apps on iPhones and iPads to provide highly personalized shopping experiences. Our success in enterprise is supported by our key partnerships. Since launching our first strategic partnership with IBM, 240 large customers have signed MobileFirst for iOS deals. Additionally, earlier in the year, we introduced 2 new technology offerings: IBM Watson services for Core ML and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple that are enabling businesses to combine machine learning and cloud for a new generation of dynamic smart apps made for iOS. Over 60 new signings across numerous industries have been added since launching these new tools. In our new partnership with Salesforce, we're excited to bring together the #1 customer relationship management platform and iOS. Together with Apple, Salesforce is redesigning its apps to embrace the native mobile platform with exclusive new features on iOS. The company can also provide tools and resources for millions of Salesforce developers to build their own native apps with a new Salesforce Mobile SDK for iOS. And finally, we recently announced Apple business manager, a new way for IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale. The response from companies around the world has been tremendous with over 40,000 companies currently enrolled. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.5 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $122.6 billion. As explained earlier this year, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $23 billion to investors during the quarter. We repurchased 92.5 million Apple shares for $19.4 billion through open market transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an all-time record. Every geographic segment grew double digits with new records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. We also set new all-time records for net income, up 23% versus last year and EPS, up 29%. And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during the year, including almost $14 billion in dividends and equivalents and over $73 billion in share repurchases. Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we're implementing as we enter our new fiscal year. First, given the increasing importance of our Services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total products and total services beginning this December quarter. Second, also beginning this December quarter, we're adopting the FASB's new standard for revenue recognition. This will not result in any change to our total revenue, but it will impact the way we report the classification of revenue between products and services. In particular, the revenue corresponding to the amortization of the deferred value of bundled services such as Maps, Siri and free iCloud services was previously reported in product revenue. After adopting the new standards, this revenue will now be reported in Services revenue. The change in classification between products and services will also apply to the costs that are associated with the delivery of such bundled services. After we file our 10-K, we will post a schedule to our Investor Relations website showing the reclassification of fiscal 2018 revenue from products to services in connection with the adoption of the new standard. The size of this reclassification amounts to less than 1% of total company revenues. And for clarity, this reclassification was not contemplated in our previously stated goal of doubling our fiscal '16 Services revenue by 2020. That goal remains unchanged and excludes the revenue that is now shifting from products to services over that time frame. Third, starting with the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac. As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal and engaged. As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow. As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. Furthermore, our unit of sale is less relevant for us today than it was in the past given the breadth of our portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion within any given product line. Fourth, starting with the December quarter, we will be renaming the other products category to wearables, home and accessories to provide a more accurate description of the items that are included in this product category. As we move ahead to the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We have the strongest lineup ever as we enter the holiday season, and we expect revenue to be between $89 billion and $93 billion, a new all-time record. This range reflects a number of factors to be considered: First, we consider the effect on Q4 and Q1 of the launch timing of our new iPhones this year versus last year; Second, we expect almost $2 billion of foreign exchange headwinds; Third, we had an unprecedented number of products ramping, and while our ramps are going fairly well, we have uncertainty around supply and demand balance; and fourth, we also face some macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% before discrete items. Also, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on November 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of November 12, 2018. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Thank you, Luca. (Operator Instructions)","Tim, there has been some real deceleration in some of these emerging markets, partly driven by some concerns around some of the rules the administration is contemplating and partly driven by things that are more specific to China, for instance, like some of the regulations around gaming. So can you talk about how you see the trajectory there for the business and what you think of the initiatives of some companies like Netflix and Fortnite trying to bypass the App Store around subscriptions? And I have a follow-up. Sure. Great question. Starting with emerging markets. The emerging markets that we're seeing pressure in are markets like Turkey, India, Brazil, Russia, these are markets where currencies have weakened over the recent period. In some cases, that resulted in us raising prices, and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see. To give you a perspective in -- at some detail, our business at India in Q4 was flat. Obviously, we would like to see that be a huge growth. Brazil was down somewhat compared to the previous year. And so I think -- or at least the way that I see these is each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different story. And I don't see it as some sort of issue that is common between those for the most part. In relation to China specifically, I would not put China in that category. Our business in China was very strong last quarter. We grew 16%, which we're very happy with. iPhone, in particular, was very strong double-digit growth there. Our other products category was also stronger, in fact, a bit stronger than even the company -- overall company number. The App Store in China, we have seen a slowdown or a moratorium to be more accurate on new game approvals. There is a new regulatory setup in China, and there's -- things are not moving the way they were moving previously. We did see a few games approved recently, but it's very far below the historic pace. And as you're probably seeing, some of the larger companies there that are public have talked about this as they've announced their earnings as well. We don't know exactly when this will -- the approvals will sort of return to a normal pace. So I would not want to predict that. I do not view, just to try -- for avoidance of doubt here, I don't view that, that issue has anything to do with the trade-related discussions between the countries. I think that is strictly a domestic issue in China. In terms of larger developers, if you sort of step back and look at the value proposition for people from the App Store, there are 2 key constituencies in that equation. There's the user, and there's the developer. If you start with the user, what the App Store provides people is sort of the best and safest place for users to get apps. And we put a -- we have a tremendous process and infrastructure around achieving that. And where it is not perfect, we wind up reviewing 100,000 -- over 100,000 apps a week between new apps and updates for existing apps and then work with developers quickly to fix the issues. And we also provide the user a one-payment model for purchasing apps and subscriptions and in-app purchases, et cetera, so that they are not in a position that they have to share their private information across many companies. And so that's sort of the proposition for the user. For the developer, we obviously provide developers a tremendous amount of developer tools, programs, compilers, languages, of course, the operating system APIs, SDKs and have a huge developer relations team. And we do a tremendous amount of marketing for developers, including the new Today editorial that we just started in the past few months, personal recommendations search, tools and so on and so forth. And so if -- there will be -- there's no doubt, in my mind, there have already been some large developers that concluded that they could do something on their own. We're fine with that. I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest -- if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the Services revenue. So it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously and 30,000 or so subscription apps. And so the subscription business itself is nearly as broad as the App Store itself is. And so that's the value proposition, I think, that the vast majority of people are very happy with it and including the most important people of all, which is the user. Appreciate that response. If I could just ask you really quick on Apple's role in health care. It's been growing significantly since the early introduction on the Watch and then the various kits for developers, including HealthKit, CareKit, et cetera. And when you combine that with your very staunch advocacy for privacy, I see Apple could become a really large disintermediating force in all the friction in the health care industry today in the way medical information is shared and distributed. Is this the way that you see the future for Apple in health care? And do you see a means to also grow your Services business through the health care offerings that could become subscriptions to your customers? I think Apple has a huge opportunity in the -- in health. And you can see from the -- our past several years that we have an intense interest in the space and are adding products and services, non-monetized services so far to that. And I don't want to talk about the future because I don't want to give away what we're doing. But this is an area of major interest to us. Yes. Shannon, I'll take this one. And at the revenue level, we started from the fact that we are very, very excited about the lineup of products and services that we have getting into the holiday season. It's the strongest lineup that we've ever had. And our guidance range, by the way, represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record, right? As I explained in my prepared remarks, there are a number of things that need to be considered as part of this guidance range, right? The first one is the fact that the launch timing of the new iPhones this year is essentially in reverse order versus last year. And that has had an effect on Q1 -- on Q4 and will have an effect on Q1. Last year, we launched the top end of our iPhone lineup, which was iPhone X during Q1, and placed the entirety of the channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. This year, we launched the top end of the lineup, which is the Xs and the Xs Max during Q4. Obviously, this resulted in a more pronounced ASP growth in Q4 of '18 and obviously a tougher compare for Q1. So I think it's important to keep that in mind as you look at the revenue guidance that we provided. The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact of life and we've dealt with it for a number of years now, is the fact that when I look at currencies around the world, virtually every foreign currency has depreciated against the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months. And when we look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we're looking at 200 basis points of headwinds, which translate, given our -- the size of our business, to almost $2 billion of headwind to our revenue. The third point that I think is important to keep in mind, and Tim has talked about this, we are launching -- in the last 6 weeks, we've launched an unprecedented number of new products. They're all ramping right now. The ramps are going fairly well, but obviously, we have some uncertainty around supply-demand balance for some of these products. And then finally, the last point that we've taken into account is what Tim's talked about in terms of some level of uncertainty at the macroeconomic level in some emerging markets, where, clearly, consumer confidence is not as high as it was 12 months ago. So take that into account, and that's how we got to the range. Yes, let me walk you through the rationale that we've used, and then I'll talk about this qualitative commentary that you were mentioning. As I said, right, our objective is to make great products, provide the best customer experience and get our customers satisfied, engaged and loyal to our ecosystem. When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last 3 years, for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. If you look at our revenue during the last 3 years, if you look at our net income during the last 3 years, if you look at our spot price during the last 3 years, there's no correlation to the units sold in any given period. As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories have become wider over time, and therefore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past because we got this much wider sales price dispersion. So unit of sale per se becomes less relevant. As I know you're aware, by the way, our top competitors in smartphones, in tablets, in computers do not provide quarterly unit sales information either. But of course, we understand that this is something of interest. And when we believe that providing qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional relevant information to investors, we will do so. Let me make one additional point there just for clarity, is that, Shannon, our intention is to continue to give revenue guidance at the company level and gross margin guidance in the other categories that we've been providing. And so the -- our guidance isn't changing. It's the actual report that changes. Mike, it's Tim. The Xs and Xs Max got off to a really great start, and we've only been selling for a few weeks. The XR, we've only got out there for, I guess, 5 -- 5 days or so at this point and so that it's -- we have very, very little data there. Usually, there is some amount of wait until a product shows -- another product shows up in look, but in -- that -- in looking at the data, on the sales data for Xs and Xs Max, there's not obvious evidence of that in the data as I see it. Like as we said, during the September quarter, we set new records for many, many Services categories, right, from Apple Music to cloud services to the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay really has an exponential trajectory right now. When we look at our Services business, we think about the fact that we have a very large and growing installed base. The installed base of all our major product categories is at an all-time high and has been growing over the last several quarters. So the opportunity for us to monetize our Services business continues to grow over time. Of course, we are also improving the quality of the services that we provide, and if you look back during the last 3 years, we've added new services to our portfolio. We added Apple Pay. We added Apple Music. We added this advertising business on our App Store. And clearly, we will want to continue to offer new services over time. So there are a number of vectors that allow us to continue to grow the business over time. We have stated that we want to double the size of the Services business from the level that we had in fiscal '16 by 2020. We are well on pace to achieve that, and we feel very, very confident about the future of -- and the opportunities that we have in the Services space. Mike, in terms of your question on AR, I have a different view than you do on this one. We -- just a year ago -- practically, a year ago, we came out with ARKit 1. 6 months or so after that, we came out with 1.5. We then recently came out with ARKit 2. The number of things that you can do are growing significantly. The number of developers that either have done something or even more the case that are working on things that I've seen are growing tremendously. There's a lot of interest out there. And the number of categories that I'm seeing from gaming to shopping to -- I was in China a few weeks ago and saw AR in the -- in an art sense, an art exhibit. I was in Berlin last week and saw it being used in a historical educational kind of sense. I'm seeing it sort of everywhere I go now. And so I think we are in the early days, and it'll keep getting better and better. But I'm really happy with where things are at the moment. Katy, if you look at the products that we've created and are manufacturing, they're really manufactured everywhere. We have significant content from the U.S. market. We have content from Japan to Korea to many countries, and we have great content from China as well. And so there are many hands in the products. The vast majority or almost all of the R&D is in the United States as well as a lot of the support organization. And I -- so as -- I think that, that basic model where you look around the world and find the best in different areas, I don't expect that model to go out of style so to speak. I think there's a reason why things have developed in that way, and I think it's great for all countries and citizens of countries that are involved in that. And I'm still of the mindset that I feel very optimistic and positive that the discussions that are going will be fruitful. The -- these relationships, these trade relationships are big and complex, and they clearly do need a level of focus and a level of updating and modernization. And so I'm optimistic of -- that the countries, the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe and so forth can work these things out and work for the benefit of everyone. You're referring to the guidance that we provided for Q1, I imagine. And let me give you the puts and takes, Katy. You're correct, we are going to be getting some benefits from commodities in general and memory in particular. Memory, on a sequential basis, it's about 30 basis points favorable for us going into the December quarter. And obviously, we're going to be benefiting from the leverage, which is typical of our seasonality in the December quarter. On the other hand, as I mentioned before, currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar. And the impact that we expect at the gross margin level from foreign exchange is a 90 basis points headwind sequentially. And of course, at this point in the cycle, we also have higher cost structures because, as I said, we've launched so many new products in the last 6 weeks. So those are the puts and takes, leverage and commodity savings on one side and FX and the new products on the other side. A question for Tim and a question for Luca, and I'll ask them at the same time, so you can decide to answer the first or second. But operationally, Tim, I think your company is at a disadvantage relative to others in India giving where items are produced versus shipped versus taxed versus installed as well as ability to own stores. So can you help us address that? Is India going to potentially be a big area as I think you've got about only 1% market share, but it sounded like things may be softened there? And then for Luca, there'd probably be a lot of pushback about not giving iPhone unit data. It sounds like you're still going to give revenue data if I heard that correctly. But some people may fear that this now means that the iPhone units are going to start going negative year-over-year because it's easy to talk about great things and not show the details of things that aren't so great. Okay. I'll start with India. We've had really great productive discussions with the Indian government, and I fully expect that, at some point, they will agree to allow us to bring our stores into the country. We've been in discussions with them, and the discussions are going quite well. There is -- as you point out, there are import duties in some or most of the product categories that we're in. In some cases, they compound. And this is an area that we're giving lots of feedback on. We do manufacture some of the entry iPhones in India, and that project has gone well. I am a big believer in India. I am very bullish on the country and the people and our ability to do well there. The currency weakness has been part of our challenge there as you can tell from just looking at the currency trend. But I sort of view these as speed bumps along a very long journey, though, in that the long term is -- I think is very, very strong there. There's a huge number of people that will move into the middle class. The government has really focused on reform in a major way and made some very bold moves, and I applaud them for doing that and sort of can't wait for the future there. And Jim, let me take the question on units. First of all, as Tim said, our approach to guidance -- providing guidance doesn't change at all, and we continue to provide the same metrics that we were providing before. In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we are doing, and it's new and it's an addition to the information that we provide to investors because we've heard some significant level of interest around this, is starting with the December quarter, for the first time, we're going to be providing information on revenue and cost of sales and therefore, gross margins for both products and services. And this will be the first time that we're going to provide gross margin information for our Services business, which we believe it is an important metric for our investors to follow. Given the rationale on why we do not believe that providing unit sales is particularly relevant for our company at this point, I can reassure you that it is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have. But as I said earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past. To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter. And that's very important because we are attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported. And so therefore, we will -- as I said, we'll provide the qualitative commentary when it is important and relevant, but at the end of the day, we make our decisions to -- from a financial standpoint, to try and optimize our revenue and our gross margin dollars. And that, we think, is the focus that is in the best interest of our investors. Jim, let me just add a couple things to that for color. Our installed base is growing at double digit, and so there's no -- and that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and customer loyalty, et cetera. The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says or he says, ""How many units you have in there?"", it sort of -- it doesn't matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.

Thanks again for joining us.","Given the $4 billion range in revenue that you're giving for the quarter and all of the -- all the things that are going on in the world right now, can you maybe give a little detail about the variables that you took into account when you were coming up with this, geopolitical trade, macro component costs, I don't know, if you can just give it some ideas as -- on what the puts and takes were? Okay. And then I just want to talk a little bit about the pullback in terms of guidance from a unit perspective. I understand you don't want to give guidance because 90 days is a short period of time and can be -- fluctuate. But what kind of qualitative commentary do you think you'll be able to provide? Because it's -- obviously, investors have spent the last however many years going P times Q. So how should we think about what we can expect? And sort of how are you going to manage this process as we go through? I know it's all our job to forecast but... With the staggered iPhone launch, were you able to discern any impact on the Xs and Xs Max from buyers potentially waiting for the XR? And what, if anything, can we take away from the December quarter guidance related to what you're seeing for early demand on the XR? And then I have a follow-up. Got it. And you mentioned record levels for various components of the Services business. As we look forward, if growth of Services is to maintain something close to the recent pace, what are the components of Services that you're particularly excited about that could drive that and be the strongest drivers? And maybe an offshoot to that, it seems like the news flow around augmented reality slowed a little bit in recent months. Is that potentially materially contributor to services in the near future? Tim, given the current trade negotiations and broader geopolitical risk, do you have any plans to consider diversifying the supply chain? And if you were to do that, either on your own or sort of forced, do you think it would have significant impact on the business or profitability? That's helpful color. And Luca, as a follow-up, NAND prices fell significantly during the September quarter. Why aren't we seeing that flow through to margin expansion to the overall company?

id=""L214""time=""00:32:01""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L215""time=""00:32:01""/>Thanks for the question, Shannon. <Sync id=""L216""time=""00:32:05""/>We're seeing -- in the iPhone space, we saw a better year-over-year performance in the last weeks of the quarter as compared to the full quarter or November and December, which was sort of a -- appears to be the trough. <Sync id=""L217""time=""00:32:26""/>I think there's a set of reasons for this. <Sync id=""L218""time=""00:32:30""/>One, we made some price adjustments, essentially backing out the weaker currency effect and then some. <Sync id=""L219""time=""00:32:46""/>The -- there's stimulus programs that the government has executed, including, and this happened in early April, VAT being reduced from 16% to 13%, so they've been aggressive in the stimulus side. <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:33:05""/>Three, our trade-in and financing programs that we implemented in our retail stores have been very well received there, and I'm happy with the results to date there. <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:33:17""/>And then four, the -- there's an improved trade dialogue between the U.S. and China. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:33:24""/>And from our point of view, this has affected consumer confidence on the ground there in a positive way. <Sync id=""L223""time=""00:33:32""/>And so I think it's a set of all of these things, and we certainly feel a lot better than we did 90 days ago. <Sync id=""L229""time=""00:34:08""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L230""time=""00:34:08""/>Thank you, Shannon. <Sync id=""L231""time=""00:34:12""/>We're glad to put the litigation behind us, and all the litigation around the world have been dismissed and settled. <Sync id=""L232""time=""00:34:25""/>We're very happy to have a multi-year supply agreement. <Sync id=""L233""time=""00:34:29""/>And we're happy that we have a direct license arrangement with Qualcomm, which was, I know, important for both companies, and so we feel good about the resolution. <Sync id=""L237""time=""00:35:11""/>We have made some adjustments in India, and we've seen preliminarily some better results there. <Sync id=""L238""time=""00:35:21""/>Everything that we do does advise everything we do in the future, so we try to learn the best we can and fold that into our thinking. <Sync id=""L239""time=""00:35:31""/>And we'll obviously do that with this as well. <Sync id=""L243""time=""00:35:53""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L244""time=""00:35:54""/>Of course, we are supporting both our products and Services business, and you can see the trajectory of our OpEx over the different quarters. <Sync id=""L245""time=""00:36:08""/>Clearly, as we add new services, we will need to make the necessary investments to support them. <Sync id=""L246""time=""00:36:16""/>Our Services business is -- has multiple streams. <Sync id=""L247""time=""00:36:22""/>In total, it is accretive to company gross margins. <Sync id=""L248""time=""00:36:27""/>You've seen the latest -- we're running services margins at over 60%. <Sync id=""L249""time=""00:36:33""/>So it's a very important business for us in many ways for our ecosystem and for our ability to monetize it. <Sync id=""L250""time=""00:36:42""/>And so clearly, we will make all the necessary investments to ensure that the new services are successful. <Sync id=""L251""time=""00:36:48""/>And we're really encouraged by the level of customer response that we received so far in anticipation for the launch of these services. <Sync id=""L256""time=""00:37:27""/>Yes, Katy. <Sync id=""L257""time=""00:37:28""/>And keep in mind, by the way, we are reporting this guidance including a 300 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, so actually, in constant currency, the numbers would be even stronger. <Sync id=""L258""time=""00:37:44""/>At the product category level, we expect that we continue to have strong revenue growth from the non-iPhone categories as we've had for the first half of our fiscal year. <Sync id=""L259""time=""00:37:59""/>We're also expecting a relative improvement in our iPhone performance on a year-over-year basis in Q3 versus the first half. <Sync id=""L260""time=""00:38:06""/>As Tim said, March was the strongest month of the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and so this has given the confidence to provide the guidance that you've seen. <Sync id=""L261""time=""00:38:20""/>Geographically, of course, as you've seen from our results for the March quarter, China is the geo where we found some challenges, but we believe the trajectory should improve over time. <Sync id=""L263""time=""00:39:14""/>Katy, this is one that I'm going to largely punt on as you would probably guess. <Sync id=""L264""time=""00:39:22""/>We look at a lot of things on the different technologies and try to look at the -- and select the right time that things come together and get those into products as soon as we can. <Sync id=""L265""time=""00:39:40""/>And the -- certainly, from a cost point of view, there has been -- the technologies have had cost pressure over the last couple of years or so. <Sync id=""L266""time=""00:39:53""/>On the flip side of that, there's a number of things in the commodity markets going in the other direction at the moment like DRAM and NAND. <Sync id=""L267""time=""00:40:04""/>And so it's difficult to project what happens next, but it's the aggregate of all of it that really matters from a price point of view. <Sync id=""L269""time=""00:40:25""/>A topic that's probably split or shared by both Tim and Luca on a response but I'll ask the question and you can decide how to divide it up. <Sync id=""L270""time=""00:40:34""/>In your opening remarks, Tim, you'd mentioned about pricing adjustments that you made in some of the markets, and then Luca talked also about the strength of the trade-in program or maybe it was Tim also. <Sync id=""L271""time=""00:40:46""/>Can you help us understand about what type of lessons or elasticity you've learned about pricing and the trade-in programs of how it impacts like revenues and COGS and margins and things? <Sync id=""L272""time=""00:41:00""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L273""time=""00:41:01""/>Jim, the -- in the opening remarks, I was really talking about China specifically. <Sync id=""L274""time=""00:41:06""/>And I mentioned 4 things that I believe are responsible for the better year-over-year performance in the Q2 relative to Q1 and also the final weeks of March being better than the Q2 average. <Sync id=""L275""time=""00:41:27""/>And those 4 are the price reductions but that's 1 of them. <Sync id=""L276""time=""00:41:35""/>But there are 3 others, and 1 of the others is the trade-in and financing programs that we instituted in our retail stores. <Sync id=""L277""time=""00:41:44""/>Clearly, what we've learned here and it's not a surprise really is that the -- many, many people do want to trade in their current phone. <Sync id=""L278""time=""00:41:55""/>It does -- from a customer user point of view, the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself. <Sync id=""L279""time=""00:42:08""/>And many people in literally every market that we've tried this in, there is a reasonable number of people that want to take and pay for something on installments instead of all at once. <Sync id=""L280""time=""00:42:25""/>And so it's a little different in each market in terms of what the elasticity is, but you can bet that we're learning quickly on all of those. <Sync id=""L281""time=""00:42:35""/>The other 2 items that are not insignificant in China that I don't want to lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on the consumer. <Sync id=""L282""time=""00:42:50""/>And the 1 that I got much visibility in -- that happened in early April was the VAT reduction from 16% to 13%, so it's a very aggressive move. <Sync id=""L283""time=""00:43:02""/>But there are other stimulus programs as well that likely have an effect to the consumer level. <Sync id=""L284""time=""00:43:09""/>And then finally, and this is not to be underweighted either, I think the improved trade dialogue between the countries affects consumer confidence in a positive way. <Sync id=""L285""time=""00:43:21""/>And so I think it's sort of the sum of all of those things. <Sync id=""L286""time=""00:43:25""/>And Jim, if I may add on the gross margin level, as we look at pricing actions, of course, anytime you do a pricing action, it is gross margin percentage diluted. <Sync id=""L287""time=""00:43:36""/>But what really matters to us and what we look at when we look at the elasticity of these programs is to see the impact on our gross margin dollars. <Sync id=""L288""time=""00:43:44""/>And what -- the experience that we've had in a few of these emerging markets has been positive in that respect, and so that's what we think matters the most really. <Sync id=""L290""time=""00:44:08""/>Tim, you shared a lot of color around trade-ins, but I was also hoping maybe you can characterize what sort of dynamics you're seeing across your installed base on these trade-ins. <Sync id=""L291""time=""00:44:20""/>What type of devices are being traded in? <Sync id=""L292""time=""00:44:23""/>Is the profile of someone who has a really old iPhone? <Sync id=""L293""time=""00:44:28""/>Or are you seeing folks that have newer iPhones trading in? <Sync id=""L294""time=""00:44:32""/>And what sort of incentives are you providing beyond sort of the financing to drive that? <Sync id=""L295""time=""00:44:39""/>And do you see this as something that can accelerate replacement cycles here over the next year or so? <Sync id=""L296""time=""00:44:45""/>And I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L297""time=""00:44:48""/>We're -- actually, the product that's being traded in is all over the place, to be honest. <Sync id=""L298""time=""00:44:53""/>It's 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus and then fewer 8 and 8 Plus. <Sync id=""L299""time=""00:45:04""/>But there's some of each of those, and so you get customers that are on the 2-year cycle and customers -- some customers on the 1-year cycle and then customers as well on the 3- and 4-year cycles. <Sync id=""L300""time=""00:45:21""/>And so it's really all over the place. <Sync id=""L301""time=""00:45:23""/>In terms of the incentives, we're offering currently in our retail stores a trade-in value that has -- that is more than the sort of the blue book of the device, if you will, for lack of a better description. <Sync id=""L302""time=""00:45:44""/>And so we have topped those up to provide an extra benefit to the user. <Sync id=""L303""time=""00:45:52""/>The installments are different in each geography. <Sync id=""L304""time=""00:45:52""/>I would say that, at the moment, the geography that is doing the best in installments would be China. <Sync id=""L305""time=""00:46:07""/>And we have a bit of a unique offering there, I think, versus the -- versus what you can get in the regular market, and so that probably further helps there. <Sync id=""L306""time=""00:46:23""/>And so you can bet that we're learning on each of these, finding the parts that the user likes the most. <Sync id=""L307""time=""00:46:31""/>I think the key is we're trying to build a -- build something into the consumer mindset that it's good for the environment and good for them to trade in their current device on a new device. <Sync id=""L308""time=""00:46:48""/>And we do our best of getting the current device to someone else that can use that or, in some cases, if the product is at an end of life, we are recycling the parts on it to make sure that it can carry on in another form. <Sync id=""L309""time=""00:47:13""/>And as my follow-up, Luca, can you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or a tailwind to your gross margins in the near term? <Sync id=""L310""time=""00:47:23""/>And does your guidance contemplate incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin headwinds? <Sync id=""L311""time=""00:47:31""/>As Tim has explained, we've reach this comprehensive agreement with Qualcomm. <Sync id=""L312""time=""00:47:36""/>As part of this, we have agreed that we're not going to share the financial terms of the agreement, so we plan to honor that. <Sync id=""L313""time=""00:47:46""/>What you see in our gross margin guidance for the June quarter, we guided 37% to 38%, fully comprehends the outcome of the agreement with Qualcomm. <Sync id=""L321""time=""00:48:40""/>Yes, I wouldn't want to get into announcing things on the call, but obviously, we're always working on new things. <Sync id=""L322""time=""00:48:47""/>And -- but we're -- right now, we're really focused on getting these 4 out there. <Sync id=""L323""time=""00:48:53""/>We have the News+ in the market today. <Sync id=""L324""time=""00:48:57""/>We'll have the Apple Arcade and the Apple TV+ products in the market in the fall, and Apple Card will go out in the summer timeframe. <Sync id=""L325""time=""00:49:08""/>And so we've got lots in front of us, and we're very excited about getting these out there. <Sync id=""L331""time=""00:49:42""/>It's growing very, very fast, Mike. <Sync id=""L332""time=""00:49:45""/>I think it was up around 70% over the previous year. <Sync id=""L333""time=""00:49:50""/>We're expanding into new geographies as well, and we still have more geographies out there that we think can move the dial further. <Sync id=""L334""time=""00:50:00""/>So it is a -- it's definitely a business that is big and getting bigger. <Sync id=""L339""time=""00:50:40""/>We're going to wait until we get these things out. <Sync id=""L340""time=""00:50:42""/>And what I can tell you right now is that the -- we're taking sort of consumer interest on the Apple Card, and there's been a significant level of interest on that and we're excited. <Sync id=""L341""time=""00:50:56""/>As you know, the -- gaming is the top category on the App Store. <Sync id=""L342""time=""00:51:01""/>And so the Apple Arcade will serve some of that market, and it serves it with a different kind of game, which we think will be great for developers and great for users. <Sync id=""L343""time=""00:51:17""/>The TV+ product plays in a market where it's -- there's a huge move from the cable bundle to over the top. <Sync id=""L344""time=""00:51:29""/>We think that most users are going to get multiple over-the-top products, and we're going to do our best to convince them that the Apple TV+ product should be one of them. <Sync id=""L345""time=""00:51:44""/>And then we're working very hard to get everyone to give Apple News+ a look because we think it's a very unique product. <Sync id=""L346""time=""00:51:56""/>And I love magazines, and we have really wanted to support the publishers. <Sync id=""L347""time=""00:52:06""/>And so we're working very hard to -- at the -- but at the very beginning of the ramp there. <Sync id=""L348""time=""00:52:13""/>We wouldn't do a service that we didn't think could be meaningful, so that's sort of the way I look at it. <Sync id=""L349""time=""00:52:24""/>Yes, these aren't hobbies. <Sync id=""L356""time=""00:52:50""/>I think India is a very important market in the long term. <Sync id=""L357""time=""00:52:56""/>It's a challenging market in the short term, but we're learning a lot. <Sync id=""L358""time=""00:53:03""/>We have started manufacturing there, which is very important to be able to serve the market in a reasonable way, and we're growing that capability there. <Sync id=""L359""time=""00:53:15""/>And we would like to place retail stores there, and we're working with the government to seek approval to do that. <Sync id=""L360""time=""00:53:28""/>And so we plan on going in there with sort of all of our might. <Sync id=""L361""time=""00:53:33""/>We've opened a developer accelerator there, which we're very happy with some of the things coming out of there. <Sync id=""L362""time=""00:53:41""/>It's a long-term play. <Sync id=""L363""time=""00:53:43""/>It's not something that's going to be on overnight huge business, but I think the growth potential is phenomenal. <Sync id=""L364""time=""00:53:55""/>It doesn't bother me that it's primarily Android business at the moment because that just means there's a lot of opportunity there. <Sync id=""L365""time=""00:54:08""/>A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on Apple.com/investor and via telephone. <Sync id=""L366""time=""00:54:15""/>And the numbers to the telephone replay are (888) 203-1112 or (719) 457-0820. <Sync id=""L367""time=""00:54:24""/>Please enter confirmation code 7060604. <Sync id=""L368""time=""00:54:29""/>And these replays will be available by approximately 5 p.m. <Sync id=""L369""time=""00:54:32""/>Pacific Time today. <Sync id=""L370""time=""00:54:34""/>Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at (408) 974-2414, and financial analysts can contact Matt Blake or me with additional questions. <Sync id=""L371""time=""00:54:46""/>Matt is at (408) 974-7406, and I'm at (408) 974-5420. <Sync id=""L372""time=""00:54:55""/>Thanks again for joining us.","<Sync id=""L208""time=""00:31:41""/>Tim, can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing in China? <Sync id=""L209""time=""00:31:47""/>Clearly, it looks like things are improving sequentially. <Sync id=""L210""time=""00:31:51""/>You also mentioned that last few weeks of the quarter were stabilizing in emerging markets, I believe. <Sync id=""L211""time=""00:31:56""/>So what are customers saying there? <Sync id=""L212""time=""00:31:58""/>What are your partners saying in China? <Sync id=""L213""time=""00:32:00""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L224""time=""00:33:46""/>And then I'm sure you're probably expecting a question on Qualcomm settlement. <Sync id=""L225""time=""00:33:49""/>So what would you like to say on the settlement? <Sync id=""L226""time=""00:33:52""/>How are you thinking about your component providers going forward? <Sync id=""L227""time=""00:33:57""/>And how should we think about this with regard to, I don't know, your development plans in the future? <Sync id=""L228""time=""00:34:03""/>Because I'm sure you're not going to talk about when you're going to do 5G but clearly, it helps that path. <Sync id=""L235""time=""00:34:54""/>Tim, you talked about China responding well to the pricing actions that you've taken in that market. <Sync id=""L236""time=""00:35:00""/>Do any of those learnings kind of carry through into how you decide pricing in the remaining emerging markets like India, et cetera, as you get ready for the next product cycle? <Sync id=""L240""time=""00:35:36""/>I just had a quick follow-up for Luca on the Services side. <Sync id=""L241""time=""00:35:41""/>Luca, we see that you're guiding to higher operating expenses quarter-on-quarter. <Sync id=""L242""time=""00:35:46""/>How much of that incremental is going in to support the new services that you're planning to launch later in the year? <Sync id=""L253""time=""00:37:07""/>Luca, if I look back over the past 5 years, June quarter revenue typically declines about 15% from the March quarter. <Sync id=""L254""time=""00:37:15""/>You're guiding to an 8% drop this year. <Sync id=""L255""time=""00:37:18""/>So can you just talk about which regions or product segments you think can outperform that typical seasonality? <Sync id=""L262""time=""00:38:39""/>And then just as a follow-up, Shannon said you're not going to talk specifics around the timing of the 5G phone, but Tim, maybe you can talk about how the company approaches a new technology like this given the higher cost but also potentially significant benefit, how you think about the right timing for coming to market with a product with those characteristics and then just, generally, how meaningful, you think, 5G is as a demand driver for upgrades in your iPhone installed base. <Sync id=""L315""time=""00:48:09""/>So you have more than 1.4 billion active devices, and at your event, you announced services that leverage that installed base. <Sync id=""L316""time=""00:48:16""/>And you have obviously a remarkable position with kind of this Trojan horse of devices out in so many households. <Sync id=""L317""time=""00:48:22""/>So I guess the question is -- and I know some of these services aren't even live yet, but should we expect a continuation of the building out of new services categories like what we saw at the March event? <Sync id=""L318""time=""00:48:31""/>Is there a pipeline of new services in the works? <Sync id=""L319""time=""00:48:34""/>Or have we kind of seen what we're likely to see on that front for the near to intermediate term? <Sync id=""L320""time=""00:48:39""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L326""time=""00:49:18""/>Right. <Sync id=""L327""time=""00:49:19""/>And then you mentioned the App Store search ad business a couple of times in the prepared remarks. <Sync id=""L328""time=""00:49:24""/>Is that reaching a point where it's become material and maybe moving the needle for overall Services revenue? <Sync id=""L329""time=""00:49:30""/>Or is there anything you can quantify related to that? <Sync id=""L330""time=""00:49:33""/>I also imagine that this is a high-margin business, at least maybe higher than the overall Services margin but wondering if you can confirm if that's the case or not. <Sync id=""L336""time=""00:50:22""/>Tim, when you look at the 4 things that you have announced, and I realize they have different dates when they're coming out, but which ones would you say, over the next 12 months, has the most potential to help your Services line? <Sync id=""L337""time=""00:50:33""/>And then maybe which one has the best long-term potential? <Sync id=""L338""time=""00:50:38""/>And then I have a quick follow-up. <Sync id=""L350""time=""00:52:26""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L351""time=""00:52:27""/>A quick follow-up on India. <Sync id=""L352""time=""00:52:29""/>Obviously, market share there is well, well below China. <Sync id=""L353""time=""00:52:32""/>I believe you're looking to start manufacturing there. <Sync id=""L354""time=""00:52:34""/>But what's the -- obviously, the potential could be huge, but the market already seems to be pretty dominated on the Android side. <Sync id=""L355""time=""00:52:42""/>So maybe if you could just talk about trying to really aggressively ramp up share there. information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.

AAPL,Q1 2019,2747,3144,994,"1. Highlights: 1. Dec. qtr. revenue, $84.3b. 1. Below original expectations. 2. Down 5% YoverY, or 3% adjusting for FX. 2. Noted four factors that would impact results when Co. provided guidance in Nov.: 1. Different iPhone launch timing from a year ago. 2. FX headwinds. 3. Supply constraints on certain products. 4. Macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets. 3. Weak macro conditions in some emerging markets were significantly more severe than Co. originally foresaw, especially in Greater China. 1. Compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than anticipated. 2. Greater China revenue down $4.8b YoverY, with declines across: 1. iPhone. 2. Mac. 3. iPad. 3. Most shortfalls relative to regional guidance, and over 100% of worldwide YoverY revenue decline was driven by performance in Greater China. 4. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than anticipated, Co.'s business grew outside of China, including new records in: 1. Americas. 2. Western Europe. 3. Central and Eastern Europe. 4. Rest of Asia Pacific. 5. Had record performance in large markets, including: 1. US. 2. Canada. 3. Mexico. 4. Germany. 5. Italy. 6. Spain. 7. Korea. 6. In the letter shared earlier this month, Co. said it is proud to participate in Chinese marketplace and that it believes AAPL's business has a bright future there over time. 7. Generated record Dec. qtr. Services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5m registered iOS developers. 1. Saw strong results from wearables business, there with revenues up over 50%. 8. Continued to grow total active installed base by adding new customers. 1. More than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during Dec. qtr. were purchasing that product for first time. 9. Despite challenging Dec. qtr., revenue from China grew slightly for full calendar year. 1. Macroeconomic factors will come and go. 2. Sees great upside and continuing to focus on things that Co. can control. 2. iPhone: 1. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max are by far the best iPhones Co. has ever shipped. 1. They share advanced technologies, including A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with Co.'s next generation Neural Engine capable of 5t operations per second. 2. Proud of iPhone lineup, and Co.'s industry-leading customer satisfaction. 1. Wouldn't change position for anyone. 3. Customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in past. 1. Pairing this with a macroeconomic factor, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue down 15% from last year. 4. Results accounted for significantly more than entire YoverY revenue decline. 1. Outside of iPhone, business grew strongly, by 19%. 5. From a customer perspective, Co. believes [aforementioned] is the sum of several factors. 1. FX: 1. Relative strength of US dollar has made Co.'s products more expensive in many parts of world. 2. In Turkey, lira depreciated by 33% over course of calendar 2018 and in Dec. qtr., revenue there was down by almost $700m from previous year. 2. Subsidy: 1. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common. 2. In Japan, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contract. 3. Competitive promotional activity frequently increased amount of subsidy during key period. 4. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies and related competition. 5. Thereby, Co. estimates that less than half of iPhone sold in Japan in 1Q19 were subsidized vs. about three-quarters a year ago and that total value of those subsidies had come down. 3. Battery replacement program: 1. For millions of customers, Co. made it inexpensive and efficient to replace battery and hold on to their existing iPhones a bit longer. 2. Some people suggested that Co. shouldn't have done this because of potential impact on upgrades, but Co. strongly believes, it was right thing to do for customers. 4. Despite aforementioned factors, total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3b at Jan.-end 2018 to 1.4b by end of Dec., reaching a new all-time high for each of main product categories and for all five geographic segments. 3. Services: 1. Large and growing installed base is a powerful testament to satisfaction and loyalty of customers, but it's also fueling fast growing Services business. 2. Services revenue set an all-time record, at $10.9b in Dec. qtr., growing 19%. 1. Had all-time records across multiple categories of services including App Store, Apple Pay, Cloud services and App Store Search Ads business. 1. Had Dec. qtr. record for AppleCare. 3. Nearly 16 years after launching iTunes Store, Co. generated highest quarterly music revenue ever due to popularity of Apple Music, now with over 50m paid subscribers. 4. App Store wrapped up its best year ever, with record holiday period results propelled by biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever. 1. Customers spent over $322m on New Year's Day alone, setting a new single day record for number of customers and purchase volume. 5. Great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8b transactions; well over twice the volume of 1Q18. 1. Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestone. 2. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway locations. 3. While all Target, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon. 4. Launched in three new countries in Dec. qtr.: 1. Germany. 2. Belgium. 3. Kazakhstan. 5. Live in 27 markets around the world. 1. Rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year. 6. Revenue from Cloud Services continues to grow rapidly with YoverY revenue up over 40% in Dec. qtr. 1. Readership of Apple News set a new record with over 85m monthly active users in three countries where Co. has launched: 1. US. 2. UK. 3. Australia. 2. In US, latest data from comScore shows that Apple News has largest audience of all news apps. 3. International audience will continue to grow with Co.'s first ever bilingual launch in Canada, available to customers later this qtr. 7. Happy with growth and breadth of Services portfolio. 1. Revenue from Services has grown from less than $8b in calendar 2010 to over $41b in calendar 2018. 2. Largest category represents less than 30% of total Services revenue and new services launched in last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth. 4. Others: 1. Mac: 1. Best qtr. ever. 2. Revenue up 9%, fueled by new MacBook Air and Mac Mini, introduced in Oct. 2. iPad: 1. Revenue up 17%. 2. Highest growth rate in almost six years, powered by new iPad Pro released in Nov. 3. Wearables, Home and Accessories: 1. Had best qtr. ever with 33% growth in total, and almost 50% growth from wearables due to strong sales of Apple Watch and AirPods. 4. Co. doesn't measure success in 90 day increments; manages Co. for long-term. 1. When considering keys to success over time, there are three that stand out: 1. Highly satisfied and loyal customers. 2. Large and growing active installed base. 3. Deeply ingrained culture of innovation. 5. Has an amazingly talented team, creating hardware, software and services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience. 1. Apple Watch is a powerful example of this. 1. Believes Co. is just beginning to see impact it can make to improving health and is deeply inspired by possibility. 2. Has embedded machine learning directly into silicon with A12 Bionic chip. 1. Custom Neural Engine provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a small package, but it enables processing of data and transactions directly on device. 2. iPhone can recognize pattern, make prediction and learn from experience, all while keeping personal information private. 6. Undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve results. 1. Making it simple to trade in an iPhone in stores and raising awareness of this opportunity. 1. Because of quality and durability of iPhone, they maintain significant residual value, making trade-ins a great opportunity. 2. It's not only great for environment, it's great for customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it's great for developers as phone that has traded in and redistributed can help grow Co.'s active installed base. 2. Beginning last week, Co. started making it easier for people to pay for their phones over time with installment payments. 1. Working on rolling out this program to more geographies as soon as Co. can. 5. Summary: 1. Confident in fundamental strength of Co.'s business. 2. Has a strong pipeline of products and services with some exciting announcements coming later this year. 3. Will continue to invest through near-term headwinds, and will emerge stronger as a result. 1. Highlights: 1. Dec. qtr. revenue, $84.3b. 1. Below expectations. 2. Set new all-time revenue records in: 1. US. 2. Canada. 3. Latin America. 4. Western Europe. 5. Central and Eastern Europe. 6. Korea. 3.

Co. is now reporting on a quarterly basis GM for products in aggregate and for Services in aggregate. 1. Products GM 34.3%. 2. Services GM 62.8%. 2. On sequential basis, products GM increased 60 BP due to positive leverage from holiday qtr., partially offset by higher cost structures as Co. launched several new products and by headwinds from FX. 3. Services GM increased 170 BP sequentially due to favorable mix and leverage, partially offset by FX. 4. Products and services GMs improved sequentially, total Co. GM was down 30 BP due to a different mix between products and services. 7. Net income $20b. 1. About flat to last year. 2. Diluted EPS $4.18; all-time record. 1. Up 7.5% YoverY. 8. Operating cash flow $26.7b; strong. 2. iPhone: 1. Revenue $52b. 2.

Believes reduction of carrier subsidies and battery replacement program had an impact in number of countries around world. 2. Had a lower number of upgrades than anticipated at beginning of qtr. 3. Global active installed base of iPhones continues to grow. 1. Reached all-time high at Dec.-end. 2. Surpassed 900m devices, up YoverY in each of five geographic segments and growing almost 75m in last 12 months alone. 3. Plans to provide information on iPhone installed base and total installed base on a periodic basis. 4.

Katy, let me take that one. <Sync id=""L198""time=""00:30:11""/>First of all, when we talk about the Services business, it's very important to start from the momentum that we have. <Sync id=""L199""time=""00:30:18""/>As you know, we have set an ambitious target for ourselves to double the size of our business from fiscal '16 to 2020, which implied, at the time, a 19% CAGR. <Sync id=""L200""time=""00:30:33""/>So far, we've been able to grow about 20%. <Sync id=""L201""time=""00:30:35""/>In fiscal '18, we grew 22%, so we are on track to achieve our objective. <Sync id=""L202""time=""00:30:40""/>And it's important to understand what is driving the growth of the business. <Sync id=""L203""time=""00:30:44""/>First of all, it's our installed base. <Sync id=""L204""time=""00:30:46""/>As we just told you, the installed base continues to grow very nicely. <Sync id=""L205""time=""00:30:52""/>It has reached 1.4 billion active devices at the end of December, and really, very little of our Services revenue is driven by what we sell in the last 90 days. <Sync id=""L206""time=""00:31:02""/>The second factor for the growth of the Services business is that, within this installed base, the percentage of users who are paying for at least 1 service is growing very strongly. <Sync id=""L207""time=""00:31:14""/>This is due to several factors. <Sync id=""L208""time=""00:31:15""/>First of all, we're offering more and more services. <Sync id=""L209""time=""00:31:19""/>During the last few years, as you know, we launched Apple Music, Apple Pay and advertising service for our developers on the App Store. <Sync id=""L210""time=""00:31:26""/>All these businesses are growing very strongly. <Sync id=""L211""time=""00:31:30""/>Second, we are making it easier for our customers to transact on our digital stores. <Sync id=""L212""time=""00:31:36""/>We accept many more payment methods today, which are very common in certain countries around the world. <Sync id=""L213""time=""00:31:43""/>We've also increased the distribution coverage for many of these services. <Sync id=""L214""time=""00:31:46""/>We're bringing AppleCare to more points of sale around the world. <Sync id=""L215""time=""00:31:50""/>We are launching Apple Pay in more and more markets and so on. <Sync id=""L216""time=""00:31:55""/>Thirdly, as you mentioned, our subscriptions are becoming a very large portion of our business, and they're growing very well above Services average. <Sync id=""L217""time=""00:32:06""/>And the fact that we are saying that we will surpass 0.5 billion during 2020, we're not putting a specific date during 2020, but I think you've seen over recent quarters that we've been adding about 120 million on a year-over-year basis for a number of quarters now. <Sync id=""L218""time=""00:32:31""/>And this is an incredible staggering number, right, when you think about it. <Sync id=""L219""time=""00:32:38""/>We're also broadening the scope of many of these services. <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:32:41""/>You should take Apple Pay as an example. <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:32:44""/>It started off as the most convenient, most private and most secure way to make a payment in a store or in an app. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:32:52""/>Then, we took Apple Pay to Safari. <Sync id=""L223""time=""00:32:55""/>Then, we started a peer-to-peer service, and we're launching it in new markets across the world every quarter. <Sync id=""L224""time=""00:33:00""/>So we are broadening that scope. <Sync id=""L225""time=""00:33:04""/>And of course, similar to what we've done in the past in the last 3 years we launched several new services, we're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users. <Sync id=""L226""time=""00:33:16""/>And we're really very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us. <Sync id=""L227""time=""00:33:20""/>I think you're referring to the deceleration in the growth rate that we've seen in the December quarter, and I think you're referring back to the growth that we reported in September. <Sync id=""L228""time=""00:33:33""/>I think an important point I need to make and I think it's helpful that you asked the question is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. <Sync id=""L229""time=""00:33:53""/>And as we explained 90 days ago, this amortization of free services in the past was reported under products and now gets reported under services. <Sync id=""L230""time=""00:34:06""/>The reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the amortization of free services is a relatively stable number, which gets applied to our growing base. <Sync id=""L231""time=""00:34:19""/>So this reclassification reduces our growth rate versus the previous classification. <Sync id=""L232""time=""00:34:31""/>This factor, by itself, represents roughly 1/3 of the deceleration that you've seen. <Sync id=""L233""time=""00:34:38""/>We talked about 27% growth in the September quarter. <Sync id=""L234""time=""00:34:42""/>With the reclassification, that growth rate was about 24.5%. <Sync id=""L235""time=""00:34:48""/>So that explains about 1/3 of that deceleration. <Sync id=""L236""time=""00:34:51""/>There are, I would say, 3 factors that explain this difference between the 24.5% to the 19%. <Sync id=""L237""time=""00:35:02""/>The first one is that foreign exchange plays a role. <Sync id=""L238""time=""00:35:08""/>Roughly 60% of our Services business is outside the United States; and as you know, the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months. <Sync id=""L239""time=""00:35:18""/>And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis. <Sync id=""L240""time=""00:35:25""/>The second factor is a well-known issue around the App Store in China. <Sync id=""L241""time=""00:35:31""/>The App Store in China is a large business for us. <Sync id=""L242""time=""00:35:36""/>We believe this issue around the approval of new game titles is temporary in nature but clearly is affecting our business right now. <Sync id=""L243""time=""00:35:47""/>And then thirdly, we are seeing some level of deceleration in AppleCare, which has had very, very strong growth during fiscal '18, where we're starting to lap some of the increase in distribution coverage that we put in place recently and the channel fill of Apple components that happened when we increased the distribution coverage. <Sync id=""L244""time=""00:36:12""/>But in general, we are very, very pleased with 19% growth, and we think that the business will continue to grow nicely going forward. <Sync id=""L249""time=""00:36:49""/>Well, Katy, we've always said that we're very committed to executing our program. <Sync id=""L250""time=""00:36:54""/>We have done almost $250 billion of repurchases from the beginning of the program. <Sync id=""L251""time=""00:37:00""/>But we've also said that we want to execute the program in an efficient, effective, I will say, disciplined manner. <Sync id=""L252""time=""00:37:09""/>And that takes into account also overall market conditions. <Sync id=""L253""time=""00:37:16""/>So that's what we did during the course of the December quarter. <Sync id=""L254""time=""00:37:20""/>We -- our fundamental view remains the same. <Sync id=""L255""time=""00:37:24""/>We are optimistic about our future, and we think there is great value in our stock. <Sync id=""L256""time=""00:37:30""/>And so we will continue to execute the program. <Sync id=""L257""time=""00:37:33""/>We will continue to report at the end of every quarter. <Sync id=""L258""time=""00:37:36""/>And by the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about the next step in our capital return program, which is something that we do traditionally in the spring. <Sync id=""L263""time=""00:38:17""/>Steve, it's Tim. <Sync id=""L264""time=""00:38:18""/>If you look at what we did this past year, we priced the iPhone XS in the U.S. the same as we priced the iPhone X the year ago. <Sync id=""L265""time=""00:38:29""/>The iPhone XS Max, which was new, was $100 more than the XS. <Sync id=""L266""time=""00:38:35""/>And then we priced the XR right in the middle of where the entry iPhone 8 and entry iPhone 8 Plus have been priced. <Sync id=""L267""time=""00:38:45""/>So it's actually a pretty small difference in the United States compared to last year. <Sync id=""L268""time=""00:38:54""/>However, the foreign exchange issue that Luca spoke of in the call and -- made that difference or amplified that difference in international markets, in particular, the emerging markets, which tended to move much more significantly versus the dollar. <Sync id=""L269""time=""00:39:17""/>And so what we have done in January and in some locations and some products is essentially absorb part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year and therefore, get close or perhaps right on the local price from a year ago. <Sync id=""L270""time=""00:39:46""/>So yes, I do think that price is a factor. <Sync id=""L271""time=""00:39:51""/>I think part of it is that, the FX piece. <Sync id=""L272""time=""00:39:56""/>And then secondly, in some markets as I had talked about in my prepared remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed markets. <Sync id=""L273""time=""00:40:09""/>I had mentioned Japan; but also even in this country, even though the subsidy has gone away for a period of time, if you're a customer that your last purchase was a 6s or 6 or in some cases, even a 7, you may have paid $199 for it -- and now in an unbundled world, it's obviously much more than that. <Sync id=""L274""time=""00:40:35""/>And so we are working through those, and we've got a number of actions to address that, including the trade-in and the installment payments, which I had mentioned as well. <Sync id=""L277""time=""00:41:02""/>Well, Steve, we did mention on the call last quarter that the different timing of our phone launches would affect the year-over-year compares. <Sync id=""L278""time=""00:41:17""/>If you remember, our top models, the XS and XS Max shipped during the September quarter, which plays the channel fill and the initial sales in that quarter. <Sync id=""L279""time=""00:41:28""/>While last year, the iPhone X shipped in Q1 in the December quarter but is in the channel fill and the initial sales in the December quarter. <Sync id=""L280""time=""00:41:37""/>So we knew that this would create a difficult compare for Q1 of '19, and this is essentially what happened. <Sync id=""L281""time=""00:41:46""/>It was pretty much in line with our expectations. <Sync id=""L282""time=""00:41:50""/>To give you more color, I would say that the XR is our most popular model, and it's followed by XS Max and then the XS. <Sync id=""L288""time=""00:42:52""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L289""time=""00:42:52""/>I mean, 3 questions there. <Sync id=""L290""time=""00:42:55""/>The first one is a question around conservatism. <Sync id=""L291""time=""00:43:00""/>As we always do, when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're going to fall within. <Sync id=""L292""time=""00:43:06""/>We've done pretty well with that up until the December quarter, right? <Sync id=""L293""time=""00:43:11""/>I mean, we've been -- we didn't miss in years and years. <Sync id=""L294""time=""00:43:14""/>So that's the idea. <Sync id=""L295""time=""00:43:16""/>It's -- there is that specific level of conservatism. <Sync id=""L296""time=""00:43:19""/>We believe that this is the range where we're going to fall within. <Sync id=""L297""time=""00:43:24""/>On channel inventory, as you know, our historical pattern for iPhone channel inventory is that, typically, we increase inventory in Q1 and we decrease in Q2. <Sync id=""L298""time=""00:43:37""/>And we think this year will be similar, and we've exited the December quarter with levels of inventory that we are comfortable with. <Sync id=""L299""time=""00:43:48""/>So that leaves us with the reality that our iPhone performance in Q1, from a revenue standpoint, was minus 15%. <Sync id=""L300""time=""00:43:58""/>And we expect that the key factors that Tim mentioned during the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also have an effect on Q2 starting with the strong U.S. dollar environment. <Sync id=""L301""time=""00:44:13""/>On a year-over-year basis, the negative impact from currency is going to be about $1.3 billion, so that's about -- a bit more than 2 points versus last year's revenue. <Sync id=""L302""time=""00:44:25""/>And so that obviously plays a role. <Sync id=""L303""time=""00:44:28""/>And the macroeconomic environment, particularly in emerging markets, will continue to be there. <Sync id=""L304""time=""00:44:34""/>On the positive side, we expect that we will continue to grow revenue nicely from the rest of the business, which is not iPhone. <Sync id=""L309""time=""00:45:47""/>We do design our products to last as long as possible. <Sync id=""L310""time=""00:45:51""/>Some people hold onto those for the life of the product, and some people trade them in. <Sync id=""L311""time=""00:45:57""/>And then that phone is then redistributed to someone else. <Sync id=""L312""time=""00:46:02""/>And so it doesn't necessarily follow that one leads to the other. <Sync id=""L313""time=""00:46:09""/>The cycles -- the average cycle has extended. <Sync id=""L314""time=""00:46:12""/>There's no doubt about that. <Sync id=""L315""time=""00:46:14""/>We've said several times, I think, on this call and before that the upgrades for the quarter were less than we anticipated due to the -- all the reasons that we had mentioned. <Sync id=""L316""time=""00:46:32""/>So where it goes in the future, I don't know, but I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality, that is the best thing for the customer and we work for the user. <Sync id=""L317""time=""00:46:46""/>And so that's the way that we look at it. <Sync id=""L324""time=""00:47:22""/>Yes, Shannon. <Sync id=""L325""time=""00:47:24""/>I think you've seen that Services gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by a significant amount. <Sync id=""L326""time=""00:47:37""/>Let me start with sequential because I think it's probably most relevant for us. <Sync id=""L327""time=""00:47:42""/>Sequentially, we increased 170 basis points. <Sync id=""L328""time=""00:47:45""/>It's a business that is growing nicely, so we get good support from our scale. <Sync id=""L329""time=""00:47:53""/>Some of these services are scaling quickly, and so we tend to expand gross margins there. <Sync id=""L330""time=""00:48:01""/>And also, we had favorable mix. <Sync id=""L331""time=""00:48:04""/>As you probably know, we have a very broad portfolio of services. <Sync id=""L332""time=""00:48:08""/>Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for Services also because of the way we account for them. <Sync id=""L333""time=""00:48:17""/>For example, you know that on the App Store, we book revenue on a net basis, and therefore, the gross margins tend to be accretive. <Sync id=""L334""time=""00:48:26""/>But we also have services that are very successful that are below the average for the Services business. <Sync id=""L335""time=""00:48:36""/>And so depending on how these separate businesses do in the marketplace, we're going to be seeing some level of movement going forward on Services margins. <Sync id=""L336""time=""00:48:47""/>But you've seen that, for the last 12 months, they've gone up nicely, 450 basis points, and sequentially, they've gone up 170 basis points. <Sync id=""L337""time=""00:48:57""/>But I wouldn't draw necessarily a conclusion on how this Services gross margin is going to move over time. <Sync id=""L338""time=""00:49:05""/>We will report, of course, at the end of every quarter. <Sync id=""L339""time=""00:49:10""/>But important to keep in mind, it's a broad portfolio with very different gross margin profiles within the portfolio. <Sync id=""L340""time=""00:49:18""/>It is important for us to grow gross margin dollars. <Sync id=""L341""time=""00:49:21""/>And if at times we grow services that are at a level of gross margins, which is below average, as long as this is good for the customer and as long as we generate gross margin dollars, we're going to be very pleased. <Sync id=""L348""time=""00:50:05""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L349""time=""00:50:05""/>Shannon, we see huge changes in customer behavior taking place now, and we think that it will accelerate as the year goes by to sort of the breakdown of the cable bundle that's been talked about for years. <Sync id=""L350""time=""00:50:21""/>And I think that it'll likely take place at a much faster pace this year. <Sync id=""L351""time=""00:50:28""/>And so we're going to participate in that in a variety of ways. <Sync id=""L352""time=""00:50:33""/>One of those is through Apple TV, and you're well familiar with that product. <Sync id=""L353""time=""00:50:39""/>The second way is the -- is AirPlay 2, which we have -- as you just pointed out, we have support on a number of different third-party TVs. <Sync id=""L354""time=""00:50:52""/>And we're excited about that. <Sync id=""L355""time=""00:50:54""/>It makes the experience in the living room with people using our products even better. <Sync id=""L356""time=""00:51:00""/>We think that people are really going to like that. <Sync id=""L357""time=""00:51:03""/>Another way is, of course, the -- all the third-party video subscriptions that are on the store. <Sync id=""L358""time=""00:51:09""/>We're participating in this today. <Sync id=""L359""time=""00:51:12""/>And I would guess that, that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle. <Sync id=""L360""time=""00:51:30""/>And then finally, original content, where -- we will participate in the original content world. <Sync id=""L361""time=""00:51:37""/>We have signed a multiyear partnership with Oprah. <Sync id=""L362""time=""00:51:42""/>But today, I'm not really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point. <Sync id=""L363""time=""00:51:49""/>We've hired some great people that I have a super amount of confidence in, and they're working really hard. <Sync id=""L364""time=""00:51:56""/>And we'll have something to say more on that later. <Sync id=""L370""time=""00:52:34""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L371""time=""00:52:34""/>In essence, when we sell a product at a certain price, we make an assumption. <Sync id=""L372""time=""00:52:39""/>We estimate the value that can be associated to providing free service. <Sync id=""L373""time=""00:52:46""/>In our case, it's providing Maps services, providing Siri and providing free iCloud to all the customers that purchase our product. <Sync id=""L374""time=""00:52:56""/>And so we calculate an estimated value. <Sync id=""L375""time=""00:53:01""/>That value gets deferred and gets amortized over the estimated period of time that we deliver the free services. <Sync id=""L376""time=""00:53:11""/>In the past, that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported under products. <Sync id=""L377""time=""00:53:17""/>Now in connection with the new revenue recognition standard, we are reclassifying essentially that amortization from products revenue to services revenue. <Sync id=""L378""time=""00:53:33""/>So total revenue has not changed. <Sync id=""L379""time=""00:53:34""/>We just report that estimated value under the services category. <Sync id=""L380""time=""00:53:40""/>We also reclassify the cost that we need to incur to provide those services. <Sync id=""L381""time=""00:53:46""/>So the gross margin rate of each services is clearly significantly dilutive to the overall Services margin. <Sync id=""L382""time=""00:53:56""/>I hope I've answered that. <Sync id=""L388""time=""00:54:31""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L389""time=""00:54:31""/>I mean, as I said, I mean, essentially, what -- the services -- I said services too is our installed base. <Sync id=""L390""time=""00:54:39""/>So the first driver is growing the installed base. <Sync id=""L391""time=""00:54:42""/>Installed base has grown nicely over the last several years. <Sync id=""L392""time=""00:54:46""/>We've added 100 million in the last 12 months alone. <Sync id=""L393""time=""00:54:50""/>So that's the first step. <Sync id=""L394""time=""00:54:51""/>Then within that installed base, of course, we want to make sure that there are more people that are so interested in our services that, in addition to transacting on those services on a free basis, they also are interested in paying for those services. <Sync id=""L395""time=""00:55:09""/>And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has increased strong double digits. <Sync id=""L396""time=""00:55:16""/>So we want to continue to do that. <Sync id=""L397""time=""00:55:18""/>We want to make it easier for our customers to actually use our services, and so we are accepting more and more payment methods around the world. <Sync id=""L398""time=""00:55:27""/>And clearly, as you said, the idea of adding new services is very important to us. <Sync id=""L399""time=""00:55:32""/>During the last 3 years, we've added Apple Pay, which has been incredibly successful and is a wonderful customer experience. <Sync id=""L400""time=""00:55:41""/>We've added Apple Music, where we now have more than 50 million paid subscribers and continues to grow very nicely. <Sync id=""L401""time=""00:55:47""/>And we've added a very useful service to our developers. <Sync id=""L402""time=""00:55:51""/>We provide an advertising service for developers on the App Store. <Sync id=""L403""time=""00:55:56""/>The way we've added these services in the past, obviously, we're also very interested in adding new services that can provide great value to our customers in the future. <Sync id=""L404""time=""00:56:06""/>And we don't want to get into product announcements here, but obviously, that is part of our strategy. <Sync id=""L405""time=""00:56:11""/>Thank you all. <Sync

quarters. <Sync id=""L192""time=""00:29:40""/>So can you talk about the factors that played into that slower growth? <Sync id=""L193""time=""00:29:45""/>And then appreciate the new disclosure around paid subscribers. <Sync id=""L194""time=""00:29:51""/>But if you compare what you added in 2018 versus what you expect to add over the next 2 years, that implies a slowdown in annual net new subscribers. <Sync id=""L195""time=""00:29:59""/>So should we be thinking about Services as a lower growth segment than what you experienced in 2018? <Sync id=""L196""time=""00:30:07""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L245""time=""00:36:25""/>Just a quick follow-up, Luca. <Sync id=""L246""time=""00:36:28""/>Share repurchases in the December quarter were well below the run rate from the June and September quarters. <Sync id=""L247""time=""00:36:35""/>How much did the weaker quarter play into your ability to carry out the buyback at the same level? <Sync id=""L248""time=""00:36:42""/>And what should we think about as the right run rate going forward? <Sync id=""L260""time=""00:38:01""/>Some have the perception that you priced the new products, the new iPhones too high. <Sync id=""L261""time=""00:38:07""/>What have you learned about price elasticity? <Sync id=""L262""time=""00:38:09""/>And do you feel that perhaps you pushed the envelope a little bit too far and might have to bring that down in the future? <Sync id=""L275""time=""00:40:50""/>I know that you're not giving units going forward, but you said you might make qualitative comments. <Sync id=""L276""time=""00:40:55""/>I was wondering if you have a comment particularly on the ASP on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id=""L284""time=""00:42:10""/>I have one for Luca and one for Tim. <Sync id=""L285""time=""00:42:14""/>Luca, looks like the midpoint of your Q2 revenue guidance implies the steepest Q1 to Q2 sequential decline in iPhone revenues in history. <Sync id=""L286""time=""00:42:27""/>It also implies a year-over-year deceleration in iPhone revenues. <Sync id=""L287""time=""00:42:35""/>And I'm wondering if you can comment about whether that's conservatism, whether you're entering the quarter with a high level of channel inventory, and maybe you can comment explicitly on that, or whether you actually think the macroeconomic conditions are getting worse. <Sync id=""L305""time=""00:44:49""/>Tim, at your September event, Lisa Jackson, an Apple VP, stated the company needed to ""design products to last as long as possible."" And Apple's clearly doing that by helping with the battery replacement program, iOS working on an older range of products, et cetera. <Sync id=""L306""time=""00:45:12""/>But I guess, the question is why doesn't that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for iPhones should continue to extend going forward, in part, because that's almost one of your objectives. <Sync id=""L307""time=""00:45:28""/>And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhone's average replacement cycle might be today and how that may have changed over the last 3 to 5 years. <Sync id=""L308""time=""00:45:38""/>And again, why wouldn't you expect it to elongate over time given some of the aforementioned things? <Sync id=""L319""time=""00:46:58""/>I wanted to ask about the trajectory of Services gross margin, up about 500 basis points, it appears, year-over-year. <Sync id=""L320""time=""00:47:05""/>You talked a little bit about sequential. <Sync id=""L321""time=""00:47:07""/>But what's driving the improvement? <Sync id=""L322""time=""00:47:10""/>Or will it be volatile as we go through the year depending on quarters and mix? <Sync id=""L323""time=""00:47:15""/>Just whatever color you can give us as we start to forecast this. <Sync id=""L342""time=""00:49:39""/>And then, Tim, can you talk a bit about video? <Sync id=""L343""time=""00:49:41""/>You've signed a myriad of deals. <Sync id=""L344""time=""00:49:44""/>There was announcement about their TV app directly on Samsung. <Sync id=""L345""time=""00:49:47""/>So perhaps when this comes out, you'll be multiplatform. <Sync id=""L346""time=""00:49:51""/>I'm just curious how you view the opportunity in video. <Sync id=""L347""time=""00:49:54""/>And I guess, assuming you can just leverage the costs that you've made already, it should be accretive to margin, I would think. <Sync id=""L366""time=""00:52:12""/>I just have a question on the free services. <Sync id=""L367""time=""00:52:14""/>Can you just describe how the math works on that? <Sync id=""L368""time=""00:52:17""/>Is it that the free services are noncash revenue that's getting booked in the services revenue with no cost and the costs come out of products? <Sync id=""L369""time=""00:52:26""/>Can you just run us through what the current state is versus how you were accounting for that before? <Sync id=""L383""time=""00:54:00""/>Yes, you're right. <Sync id=""L384""time=""00:54:01""/>So it's in mixed services gross margin. <Sync id=""L385""time=""00:54:02""/>Got it. <Sync id=""L386""time=""00:54:03""/>And then my other -- my second question is just when you think about growth in Services, you have selling more to existing paid subscription customers or it's the 300 million going to 0.5 billion. <Sync id=""L387""time=""00:54:15""/>If you can just talk, at a high level, as far as when you look at growth going forward, is it about -- what is the mix in terms of selling more to existing users, getting new users or -- and maybe some of the individual services that you see the biggest growth opportunity? information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.

id=""L186""time=""00:31:22""/>Of course, this is our best estimate of where we think we will land. <Sync id=""L187""time=""00:31:25""/>Clearly, we expect to have continued strong growth from the non-iPhone categories. <Sync id=""L188""time=""00:31:33""/>We have great momentum in Wearables. <Sync id=""L189""time=""00:31:35""/>We mentioned that we were up almost 50% in the June quarter or actually over 50% in the June quarter. <Sync id=""L190""time=""00:31:46""/>Our Services business, we set an all-time record in June. <Sync id=""L191""time=""00:31:50""/>And so these 2 categories have become really important and really large for us. <Sync id=""L192""time=""00:31:56""/>And so as we continue to grow quickly, that is going to help us as we go through the year. <Sync id=""L193""time=""00:32:03""/>Keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter. <Sync id=""L199""time=""00:32:34""/>Yes, Amit. <Sync id=""L200""time=""00:32:34""/>It's Tim. <Sync id=""L201""time=""00:32:35""/>I apologize for my voice. <Sync id=""L202""time=""00:32:36""/>I'm suffering from an allergy. <Sync id=""L203""time=""00:32:39""/>But what happened last quarter in China was -- it's a confluence of things. <Sync id=""L204""time=""00:32:46""/>The government stimulus just came in terms of a VAT reduction, a very bold one. <Sync id=""L205""time=""00:32:53""/>We took some pricing action. <Sync id=""L206""time=""00:32:56""/>We instituted our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores and worked with certain channel partners on that as well. <Sync id=""L207""time=""00:33:08""/>And we're seeing a growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem during the quarter. <Sync id=""L208""time=""00:33:14""/>And so when you look at it, each of our categories, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Wearables, Services, everything improved sequentially. <Sync id=""L209""time=""00:33:27""/>So we couldn't be happier with the results or the progress, I should say. <Sync id=""L210""time=""00:33:34""/>I would point out, as I think I had mentioned in my comments, that we actually grew in constant currency for Greater China, and we grew in Mainland China on a reported basis. <Sync id=""L211""time=""00:33:49""/>So there's several things going on there that are quite positive. <Sync id=""L217""time=""00:34:40""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L218""time=""00:34:40""/>I think it's important to start with that 18% in constant currencies, Shannon. <Sync id=""L219""time=""00:34:47""/>Our reported results are on a normalized basis, removing the onetime item from last year, was 15%. <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:34:56""/>Clearly, FX plays a role around the world, 300 basis points of FX impact during the June quarter. <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:35:04""/>In spite of that, it was an all-time record revenue. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:35:11""/>Our installed base continues to grow. <Sync id=""L223""time=""00:35:14""/>It's growing in every geography and it's growing across all our major product categories, and that is very, very important for the Services -- for the Services business. <Sync id=""L224""time=""00:35:28""/>I would say -- I'll give you a bit more color around 2 offsetting factors around this performance during the June quarter. <Sync id=""L225""time=""00:35:37""/>On one side, the App Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially. <Sync id=""L226""time=""00:35:46""/>We had double-digit growth on the App Store in every geography. <Sync id=""L227""time=""00:35:52""/>In China, we saw significant acceleration. <Sync id=""L228""time=""00:35:57""/>As you know, we tend to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles, and the government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter that has helped our performance there. <Sync id=""L229""time=""00:36:13""/>On the other side, AppleCare. <Sync id=""L230""time=""00:36:17""/>I mentioned AppleCare was an all-time record in June so a really strong performance. <Sync id=""L231""time=""00:36:22""/>But our growth has decelerated in AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected because we are comping this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had, we've had significant success during the last 18 to 24 months in really broadening our coverage of AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers. <Sync id=""L232""time=""00:36:52""/>And obviously, as we go through the year, those comps become a bit more difficult. <Sync id=""L233""time=""00:37:01""/>Having said all that, you know that we've given ourselves a couple of targets and we feel very confident about reaching those targets. <Sync id=""L234""time=""00:37:11""/>The first one is that we wanted to double the size of the Services business from our fiscal '16 to 2020. <Sync id=""L235""time=""00:37:18""/>We are on our way there. <Sync id=""L236""time=""00:37:22""/>Paid subscriptions is another target. <Sync id=""L237""time=""00:37:23""/>It's important to us. <Sync id=""L238""time=""00:37:25""/>It's an important way for us to monetize our ecosystem. <Sync id=""L239""time=""00:37:30""/>We set a target of surpassing 0.5 billion paid subscriptions on the ecosystem during 2020. <Sync id=""L240""time=""00:37:39""/>We're already at 420 million now. <Sync id=""L241""time=""00:37:41""/>So we feel confident there. <Sync id=""L242""time=""00:37:43""/>And of course, as you mentioned, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to be launching new services soon. <Sync id=""L243""time=""00:37:50""/>As Tim said, we're starting the rollout of Apple Card in August. <Sync id=""L244""time=""00:37:57""/>And there's 2 more very important services that we're going to be adding to our portfolio during the fall. <Sync id=""L245""time=""00:38:03""/>One is Apple Arcade, which is our gaming subscription service, and of course, Apple TV+, which is our video streaming service. <Sync id=""L246""time=""00:38:14""/>So obviously, these services will help us carry on with the momentum that we have in Services. <Sync id=""L254""time=""00:38:41""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L255""time=""00:38:42""/>So of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. <Sync id=""L256""time=""00:38:52""/>I would say on the positive, we expect to benefit from leverage, as you've seen from our revenue guidance, and from cost savings because, as you know, the commodity environment is fairly favorable right now. <Sync id=""L257""time=""00:39:08""/>On the negative side, the headwind on gross margins on a year-over-year basis from foreign exchange is about 100 basis points. <Sync id=""L258""time=""00:39:17""/>And so we need to keep that in mind, but we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided. <Sync id=""L263""time=""00:40:06""/>Katy, it's Tim. <Sync id=""L264""time=""00:40:08""/>We obviously took into account all of the information that we had and coming out with the guidance, including linearity across last quarter and how this quarter has started. <Sync id=""L265""time=""00:40:21""/>And so we've obviously looked at that in quite much detail. <Sync id=""L270""time=""00:41:06""/>Katy, let me just talk about the new services that we've announced in March and then also about the timing of how we get to revenue, right? <Sync id=""L271""time=""00:41:16""/>We've announced Apple News+, and this is the service that is available for consumers right now. <Sync id=""L272""time=""00:41:26""/>We've announced our channel service, which has also become available a few weeks ago. <Sync id=""L273""time=""00:41:32""/>The other 3 services, the Card is launching in August, the gaming service and the video service are starting in the fall. <Sync id=""L274""time=""00:41:41""/>Keep in mind for all these services, there's a trial period upfront. <Sync id=""L275""time=""00:41:45""/>There's going to be different trial periods, we'll see what they look like. <Sync id=""L276""time=""00:41:49""/>So the road to monetization takes some time. <Sync id=""L277""time=""00:41:53""/>Obviously, all of them will add to our base and will help us with growth rates as we get into next year. <Sync id=""L283""time=""00:42:27""/>It's Tim. <Sync id=""L284""time=""00:42:27""/>In retail, it was quite successful. <Sync id=""L285""time=""00:42:31""/>We got going in a larger way during that quarter. <Sync id=""L286""time=""00:42:36""/>We were pretty much just ramping in the previous quarter. <Sync id=""L287""time=""00:42:41""/>And trade-in, as a percentage of their total sales, is significant and financing is a key element of it. <Sync id=""L288""time=""00:42:50""/>Those 2 things in the aggregate led retail -- the combination of retail and online, we -- to short form that as retail, are Apple Store, led to growth in June. <Sync id=""L289""time=""00:43:02""/>And so we feel very, very good about our trajectory. <Sync id=""L290""time=""00:43:06""/>We are obviously taking those programs and advocating those more widely. <Sync id=""L291""time=""00:43:13""/>And that is at different levels of implementation throughout different geographies because we're working with our carrier partners on those and retail partners. <Sync id=""L298""time=""00:43:57""/>Well, there are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, right? <Sync id=""L299""time=""00:44:02""/>We have other products where people are both purchasing things, they're watching Apple TV. <Sync id=""L300""time=""00:44:11""/>We offer Apple Music on Android, and so there's a series of things that are outside of that. <Sync id=""L301""time=""00:44:18""/>And so we'll see what we do in the future. <Sync id=""L302""time=""00:44:20""/>I don't want to really get into that. <Sync id=""L303""time=""00:44:24""/>But more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way I see it is we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever. <Sync id=""L304""time=""00:44:35""/>We've got new products on the way. <Sync id=""L305""time=""00:44:37""/>The pipeline is full of great new stuff, both on the product and services side. <Sync id=""L306""time=""00:44:44""/>We're very fortunate and work very hard to have loyal customers and to continue attracting an impressive number of switchers. <Sync id=""L307""time=""00:44:54""/>The installed base is growing, hit a new record. <Sync id=""L308""time=""00:44:57""/>That's obviously good. <Sync id=""L309""time=""00:44:59""/>And it hit a new record across all geographies and across all categories. <Sync id=""L310""time=""00:45:06""/>And so this is a really good thing. <Sync id=""L311""time=""00:45:11""/>And we've got the Wearables area that is doing extremely well. <Sync id=""L312""time=""00:45:18""/>We stuck with that when others perhaps didn't and really put a lot of energy into this and a lot of R&D and are in a very good position today to keep playing out the what's next there. <Sync id=""L313""time=""00:45:35""/>At the same time, on the market side, we have emerging markets where we have low penetration. <Sync id=""L314""time=""00:45:43""/>And in -- during the quarter, tactically, emerging markets had a bit of a rebound. <Sync id=""L315""time=""00:45:48""/>In fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. <Sync id=""L316""time=""00:45:55""/>We still declined on a reported basis. <Sync id=""L317""time=""00:45:59""/>India bounced back. <Sync id=""L318""time=""00:46:01""/>During the quarter, we returned to growth there. <Sync id=""L319""time=""00:46:04""/>We're very happy with that. <Sync id=""L320""time=""00:46:05""/>We grew in Brazil as well. <Sync id=""L321""time=""00:46:09""/>We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market. <Sync id=""L322""time=""00:46:12""/>Luca mentioned some of this in his comments, and we think that continues to be a big opportunity for us. <Sync id=""L323""time=""00:46:19""/>And then we've got lots of what I would call core technology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we're placing big bets, and I think we have a big future in addition to the health kinds of things that may fall out of the Watch. <Sync id=""L324""time=""00:46:38""/>And so hopefully, that kind of this gives you a view over the total. <Sync id=""L325""time=""00:46:42""/>And so we're focusing on products and services and there will be some services that aren't hooked and some that are hooked not on current period sales are mostly -- very much services are rarely connected on that today or at least not a high percentage by any means. <Sync id=""L326""time=""00:47:07""/>They're more correlated to the installed base, the active installed base and also the level of transacting customers that are there and the amount per customer, which relates also to the offering that we have. <Sync id=""L328""time=""00:47:37""/>Tim, the China trade situation remains sort of fluid over here and recently -- more recently, you asked for some tariff exemptions. <Sync id=""L329""time=""00:47:45""/>We're not granted those. <Sync id=""L330""time=""00:47:46""/>How are you thinking about the longer-term footprint for manufacturing? <Sync id=""L331""time=""00:47:51""/>And can you talk about any potential alternatives that you've looked at and considered in moving parts of production potentially out of China? <Sync id=""L332""time=""00:47:57""/>And I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L333""time=""00:47:57""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L334""time=""00:47:58""/>I know there's been a lot of speculation around the topic of different moves and so forth. <Sync id=""L335""time=""00:48:05""/>I wouldn't put a lot of stock into those, if I were you. <Sync id=""L336""time=""00:48:09""/>The way that I view this is the vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere. <Sync id=""L337""time=""00:48:15""/>There's a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. <Sync id=""L338""time=""00:48:29""/>And so that's the nature of a global supply chain. <Sync id=""L339""time=""00:48:35""/>I think -- largely, I think that will carry the day in the future as well. <Sync id=""L340""time=""00:48:45""/>In terms of the exclusions, we've been making the Mac Pro in the U.S. We want to continue to doing that. <Sync id=""L341""time=""00:48:53""/>And so we're working and investing currently in capacity to do so because we want to continue to be here. <Sync id=""L342""time=""00:49:05""/>And so that's what's behind the exclusions. <Sync id=""L343""time=""00:49:07""/>And so we're explaining that and hope for a positive outcome. <Sync id=""L344""time=""00:49:20""/>And there's -- Luca, maybe for you, there's been some significant destocking of inventory in the first calendar half of this year in iPhone. <Sync id=""L345""time=""00:49:28""/>Can you comment about the broader channel inventory levels, where you are in your typical ranges, especially given the comment around June iPhone sales being quite strong? <Sync id=""L346""time=""00:49:37""/>And do you expect anything atypical in channel inventory dynamics in the September quarter? <Sync id=""L347""time=""00:49:44""/>Yes, Wamsi. <Sync id=""L348""time=""00:49:44""/>As you know, we're not getting into this topic very much, but I think I can give you some color here. <Sync id=""L349""time=""00:49:52""/>You know that in general, we decreased our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter. <Sync id=""L350""time=""00:50:01""/>That has been traditionally what we've done. <Sync id=""L351""time=""00:50:04""/>This year, we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last year. <Sync id=""L352""time=""00:50:11""/>And that is true in total, and it's true for Greater China as well. <Sync id=""L353""time=""00:50:15""/>So we feel very good about our channel inventory ranges as we get into the September quarter. <Sync id=""L354""time=""00:50:22""/>I hope that helps you with that. <Sync id=""L356""time=""00:50:37""/>The first question is probably for Tim and the second one for Luca, and I'll ask them at the same time so you can pick and choose whichever one you want to answer, first and second. <Sync id=""L357""time=""00:50:45""/>But the first question, Tim. <Sync id=""L358""time=""00:50:47""/>Regarding the installed base comment you've made, which is quite encouraging, but yet when you look at the iPhone revenue year-over-year, the past several quarters has been down. <Sync id=""L359""time=""00:50:58""/>Can you help us bridge the gap of how is the installed base growing? <Sync id=""L360""time=""00:51:03""/>Is it mostly because like secondary users are the new ones coming into the system as people are holding their phones longer? <Sync id=""L361""time=""00:51:12""/>And what does that user typically bring  in with them or something unique relative to what we historically know? <Sync id=""L362""time=""00:51:19""/>And then for Luca, you've been investing a lot, a lot, lot, lot and a lot of these services are now coming to pass, whether it be AppleCare, Apple cloud, all these Wearables, and soon Apple Pay and Arcade. <Sync id=""L363""time=""00:51:32""/>Are we at a point where now, a lot of harvesting is going to happen? <Sync id=""L364""time=""00:51:35""/>Or do you kind of continue these relatively same investments that you've been doing for the future strategy? <Sync id=""L365""time=""00:51:43""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L366""time=""00:51:43""/>Jim, it's Tim. <Sync id=""L367""time=""00:51:45""/>I'll start with your installed base question. <Sync id=""L368""time=""00:51:47""/>Installed base is a function of upgrades and the time between those. <Sync id=""L369""time=""00:51:56""/>It's a function of the number of switchers coming into the iOS, macOS and so forth tents. <Sync id=""L370""time=""00:52:06""/>It's a function of the robustness of the secondary market, which we think overwhelmingly hits incremental customer. <Sync id=""L371""time=""00:52:15""/>And it's a function still in the emerging markets and somewhat developed markets, to a lesser degree, of people new that -- they're buying their first smartphone. <Sync id=""L372""time=""00:52:28""/>There are still quite a few people in the world in that category. <Sync id=""L373""time=""00:52:32""/>And so the reason that the installed base doesn't correlate to the 90-day clock is that what's happening underneath the numbers is switchers are still a very key piece of what's going on. <Sync id=""L374""time=""00:52:48""/>The secondary market is very key, and we're doing programs, et cetera, to try to increase that because we think we'd wind up hitting a customer that we don't hit in another way. <Sync id=""L375""time=""00:53:05""/>And the upgrades, where people are holding on to their device a bit longer than they were, they're staying in the ecosystem. <Sync id=""L376""time=""00:53:15""/>And then you have the people in the new category as well. <Sync id=""L377""time=""00:53:19""/>And so that's sort of the equation. <Sync id=""L378""time=""00:53:22""/>I don't want to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily, mathematically, how the installed base is growing in an environment where the iPhone revenue is declining within a 90-day kind of window. <Sync id=""L379""time=""00:53:42""/>And Jim, on OpEx, obviously, it's very important for us to continue to invest in the business, particularly on the R&D side because we always want to bring more innovation into the market. <Sync id=""L380""time=""00:53:55""/>We want to improve the user experience and differentiate our products and services in the marketplace. <Sync id=""L381""time=""00:54:01""/>So we will continue to do that. <Sync id=""L382""time=""00:54:05""/>There are some types of investments, of course, that are very strategic for us and they will have long-term implications. <Sync id=""L383""time=""00:54:13""/>You've seen the announcement that we made around the Intel acquisition. <Sync id=""L384""time=""00:54:17""/>Very important strategically for us. <Sync id=""L385""time=""00:54:20""/>It requires upfront investment, of course. <Sync id=""L386""time=""00:54:24""/>As you've seen from this quarter and also from the past, we will continue to run our SG&A portion of OpEx tightly. <Sync id=""L387""time=""00:54:34""/>We will -- of course, we'll continue to invest in marketing and advertising. <Sync id=""L388""time=""00:54:39""/>We talked about a lot of new services that we are launching during the fall and Apple Card the next month. <Sync id=""L389""time=""00:54:48""/>Obviously, they will require the appropriate level of marketing and advertising as we launch them to the general public. <Sync id=""L390""time=""00:55:00""/>When you look in total at where we are in terms of our expense-to-revenue ratio for operating expenses, you know quite well that we are extremely competitive relative to other tech companies. <Sync id=""L391""time=""00:55:16""/>So we want to continue to be competitive and at the same time, we will not under invest in the business. <Sync id=""L396""time=""00:56:00""/>We're seeing good interest across virtually everything that we announced at WWDC. <Sync id=""L397""time=""00:56:05""/>I couldn't be happier with the developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier. <Sync id=""L398""time=""00:56:21""/>Lots of interest there. <Sync id=""L399""time=""00:56:21""/>Lots of interest from the watch App Store to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port a iOS app to the Mac. <Sync id=""L400""time=""00:56:33""/>We think this is huge and so great for the user experience. <Sync id=""L401""time=""00:56:38""/>And so you look at all of these and all of the things that I talked about earlier and I couldn't be happier with the reception that we're getting and the work that is going on behind the scenes right now to ready -- for the developers readying their apps for the fall. <Sync id=""L406""time=""00:57:18""/>We don't comment on future products. <Sync id=""L407""time=""00:57:22""/>With respect to 5G, it's -- I think most people would tell you it's -- we're in sort of the extremely early, early innings of it and even more so on a global basis. <Sync id=""L408""time=""00:57:36""/>So we couldn't be more proud of what our lineup is and we're excited about the great pipeline of both hardware and software, and we won't trade our position for anyone's. <Sync id=""L409""time=""00:57:46""/>Thank you, Samik.

think about the September quarter guide, it's implied, I think, up 16% or so sequentially. <Sync id=""L183""time=""00:31:08""/>Historically, at least in that guide has been in the 10% low double-digit kind of range. <Sync id=""L184""time=""00:31:12""/>Just maybe help us understand what gives you the confidence for a better-than-seasonal guide in September either from a geo or product basis would be helpful. <Sync id=""L194""time=""00:32:11""/>Fair enough. <Sync id=""L195""time=""00:32:15""/>That's really helpful. <Sync id=""L196""time=""00:32:15""/>And I guess if I just follow up on China, impressed to see the continued recovery you guys are seeing despite all the headlines that are out there. <Sync id=""L197""time=""00:32:25""/>Just curious what are the few things that are driving the success in China? <Sync id=""L198""time=""00:32:29""/>And how sustainable do you think those changes are for Apple as you go forward? <Sync id=""L213""time=""00:34:06""/>Can you talk a bit about what's going on within Services, some of the puts and takes? <Sync id=""L214""time=""00:34:12""/>I know Luca, you gave us some color in terms of the growth rates in that. <Sync id=""L215""time=""00:34:16""/>But I'm just curious as -- and I know you won't talk about future products, but as you think about the opportunities, you think about what you've got now and in the future and then some of the -- what's been going on with China in that, is there something that could reaccelerate or again the 18% on a constant currency basis is obviously quite strong. <Sync id=""L216""time=""00:34:38""/>But how are you thinking about it? <Sync id=""L247""time=""00:38:23""/>Great. <Sync id=""L248""time=""00:38:23""/>And this is probably for you too as well, Luca. <Sync id=""L249""time=""00:38:25""/>Can you talk about gross margin? <Sync id=""L250""time=""00:38:28""/>The guidance was pretty solid. <Sync id=""L251""time=""00:38:30""/>Obviously, there are various things that are at play here. <Sync id=""L252""time=""00:38:33""/>I know you mentioned the $1 billion worth of top line impact, I think, from currency next quarter. <Sync id=""L253""time=""00:38:37""/>But maybe if you can kind of talk about what went into your gross margin guidance? <Sync id=""L260""time=""00:39:34""/>I'd like to go back to the discussion around strength in China in the quarter and understand what linearity looked like. <Sync id=""L261""time=""00:39:42""/>I asked because there was some industry data around the smartphone market in China that seemed to deteriorate in the month of June, the App Store data deteriorated a little bit in June. <Sync id=""L262""time=""00:39:53""/>And just curious if that's something you saw in the business, and if it at all informs your outlook around the pace of the China business as you go into September. <Sync id=""L266""time=""00:40:30""/>And then just on the App Store, appreciate there's not a lot of detail out around exact timing and even some pricing of the new services. <Sync id=""L267""time=""00:40:39""/>But how should we think about the new services that launched in March impacting the overall Services growth? <Sync id=""L268""time=""00:40:51""/>Does that start to benefit the model in the back half of this calendar year? <Sync id=""L269""time=""00:40:58""/>Or will the impact be more longer term in nature and really show up in 2020? <Sync id=""L279""time=""00:42:12""/>I have 2 of them. <Sync id=""L280""time=""00:42:13""/>First one, on the iPhone trade-in program, how effective was it and what percentage of iPhone sales came from the trade-ins? <Sync id=""L281""time=""00:42:22""/>And are there any other geographies where you're left to roll it out? <Sync id=""L282""time=""00:42:24""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L292""time=""00:43:29""/>Got it, got it. <Sync id=""L293""time=""00:43:30""/>That's very helpful, Tim. <Sync id=""L294""time=""00:43:31""/>And then a follow-up for you, a much longer-term question. <Sync id=""L295""time=""00:43:34""/>I understand we're in the very early innings of the Services growth story. <Sync id=""L296""time=""00:43:39""/>Is there a way to think about it down the road that 3 or 5 years down the road, would the Services growth be focused or will it still be tethered to the hardware of the iPhone? <Sync id=""L297""time=""00:43:49""/>Or do you think at some point down the road, Services would be independent by itself and not really tied to your hardware installed base? <Sync id=""L393""time=""00:55:33""/>I just wanted to start off with the announcement of the WWDC around the independent App Stores for the Watch and the iPads. <Sync id=""L394""time=""00:55:45""/>What level of interest have you seen from developers and how are they thinking about the ability to monetize services independently on those App Stores? <Sync id=""L395""time=""00:55:53""/>And how does it help you position Wearables more formally into the health and fitness category? <Sync id=""L402""time=""00:56:54""/>Got it. <Sync id=""L403""time=""00:56:54""/>If I can just follow up on the China market. <Sync id=""L404""time=""00:57:02""/>One of the things that we're looking at is with these -- going into the new year into 2020, there'll be a lot of 5G phones launching in that market from the Android players. <Sync id=""L405""time=""00:57:12""/>How you're thinking about the competitive landscape there as you enter next year? information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of

early going on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. <Sync id=""L205""time=""00:31:42""/>It's early, but the trends look very good, so I don't want to make a long-range forecast here. <Sync id=""L206""time=""00:31:49""/>We've put our current thinking in the guidance, and you can tell that from the guidance, we are bullish. <Sync id=""L213""time=""00:32:24""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L214""time=""00:32:24""/>Katy, of course. <Sync id=""L215""time=""00:32:26""/>As you said, I mean, at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially. <Sync id=""L216""time=""00:32:37""/>On one side, we expect -- on the positive side, we expect leverage from higher revenue. <Sync id=""L217""time=""00:32:47""/>On the other side, foreign exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we got right now. <Sync id=""L218""time=""00:32:55""/>It's going to be negative 70 basis points on a sequential basis. <Sync id=""L219""time=""00:33:00""/>Also, keep in mind that during the holiday season, we have a higher mix of products revenue than we have in other quarters. <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:33:08""/>And that obviously is dilutive to the company margin. <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:33:16""/>On a year-over-year basis, we're also about flat. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:33:23""/>And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing. <Sync id=""L223""time=""00:33:26""/>The environment is better than it was a year ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id=""L229""time=""00:34:19""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L230""time=""00:34:19""/>Michael, it's Tim. <Sync id=""L231""time=""00:34:21""/>The Wearables have done extremely well. <Sync id=""L232""time=""00:34:23""/>It was an acceleration further from the previous quarters, so we're thrilled with the results. <Sync id=""L233""time=""00:34:31""/>As to what's driving it, it's the totality that's driving it. <Sync id=""L234""time=""00:34:36""/>For some people, it's about fitness. <Sync id=""L235""time=""00:34:39""/>For some people, it's about health. <Sync id=""L236""time=""00:34:40""/>For some other people, it's about communication, and for some people, it's all of the above. <Sync id=""L237""time=""00:34:46""/>And I think the new feature of always-on on Series 5 is a game-changer for many of our users. <Sync id=""L238""time=""00:34:57""/>And in terms of other health-related things that we have going, we will be continuing to build out our health records connection into the Health app, really democratizes the information about people's health, and so they can easily go from doctor to doctor. <Sync id=""L239""time=""00:35:23""/>We've got the research going that I've mentioned earlier. <Sync id=""L240""time=""00:35:27""/>There will be more of those through time. <Sync id=""L241""time=""00:35:30""/>And obviously, we've got things that we're not going to talk about just yet that we're working on. <Sync id=""L242""time=""00:35:36""/>But as I've said before, my view is there will be a day in the future that we look back and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health. <Sync id=""L245""time=""00:36:07""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L246""time=""00:36:08""/>It's a gift to our users. <Sync id=""L247""time=""00:36:10""/>And from a business point of view, we'd like to -- we're really proud of the content. <Sync id=""L248""time=""00:36:16""/>We'd like as many people as possible to view it. <Sync id=""L249""time=""00:36:21""/>And so this allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going. <Sync id=""L250""time=""00:36:29""/>And so we're -- we feel great about doing that. <Sync id=""L251""time=""00:36:33""/>I think it's a bold move. <Sync id=""L252""time=""00:36:35""/>And the price also for those people that are not buying a device in the period of time that we offer this, the price is very aggressive as well. <Sync id=""L253""time=""00:36:46""/>You think about the quality of content that you get for $4.99, and it's amazing. <Sync id=""L254""time=""00:36:55""/>It is amazing. <Sync id=""L260""time=""00:37:32""/>I think we have opportunities, Amit, in both the growth of the installed base. <Sync id=""L261""time=""00:37:38""/>As Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across every category, hit new highs in the last quarter. <Sync id=""L262""time=""00:37:47""/>And we hit new highs in all of our top 20 markets. <Sync id=""L263""time=""00:37:52""/>And so the installed base is clearly a piece of it. <Sync id=""L264""time=""00:37:56""/>Getting the trade-in program going and the secondary market moving has been helpful in that as well. <Sync id=""L265""time=""00:38:07""/>And of course, the -- ultimately, the thing that builds the installed base is to make customers happy. <Sync id=""L266""time=""00:38:16""/>And that's our -- always our top objective is to have satisfied customers. <Sync id=""L267""time=""00:38:21""/>The other thing that is obviously happening is in many areas, the ARPU is increasing. <Sync id=""L268""time=""00:38:30""/>And so as there's more offers out there, I mean, the one that is today getting the attention is on the streaming side. <Sync id=""L269""time=""00:38:39""/>But if you look at the number of services that have been added over the years, it's significant. <Sync id=""L270""time=""00:38:47""/>And people love them. <Sync id=""L271""time=""00:38:50""/>And so it's really both of those. <Sync id=""L272""time=""00:38:52""/>And obviously, finally, getting more people that are enjoying things for free to elect to pay for some of the premium services. <Sync id=""L273""time=""00:39:06""/>So it's sort of all 3 of those. <Sync id=""L278""time=""00:39:34""/>Well, we're not releasing the precise numbers of our Wearables, but it is a really nice try in getting me to say that. <Sync id=""L279""time=""00:39:42""/>The -- what we're seeing in terms of new ads on the watch, I think Luca may have mentioned this in his comments, is about 3/4 of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch. <Sync id=""L280""time=""00:39:57""/>And so we are still and significantly in the build mode there. <Sync id=""L281""time=""00:40:04""/>And so don't think of the penetration as anywhere near a sort of a mature penetration. <Sync id=""L282""time=""00:40:13""/>We got a lot left there. <Sync id=""L283""time=""00:40:15""/>And the AirPods just keep hitting new highs. <Sync id=""L284""time=""00:40:21""/>And I anticipate that will carry over to this quarter too, and we're really proud to add another product up there for people wanting noise-canceling with the AirPods Pro beginning to sell today. <Sync id=""L289""time=""00:40:56""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L295""time=""00:41:19""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L296""time=""00:41:19""/>We had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. <Sync id=""L297""time=""00:41:33""/>And so we feel really good about how we've gotten started there. <Sync id=""L298""time=""00:41:39""/>As you can tell from the numbers, we've significantly improved since the beginning of the year. <Sync id=""L299""time=""00:41:45""/>We've gone from minus well into the 20s to minus 2% last quarter. <Sync id=""L300""time=""00:41:53""/>And if you looked at that in constant currency, we actually grew 1%. <Sync id=""L301""time=""00:41:57""/>And so there's a very slight growth there. <Sync id=""L302""time=""00:42:00""/>We obviously want that to be better. <Sync id=""L303""time=""00:42:04""/>But we feel good about how we're doing. <Sync id=""L304""time=""00:42:06""/>I think it's a combination of things that are -- that have turned things around. <Sync id=""L305""time=""00:42:12""/>On a macro basis, I think the trade tension is less, and that clearly looks positive right now with the comments that we've been reading in the press. <Sync id=""L306""time=""00:42:26""/>Secondly, the products have been extremely well-received there. <Sync id=""L307""time=""00:42:33""/>Third, the things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view, and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have moved the dial. <Sync id=""L308""time=""00:42:46""/>And so it's sort of a -- the sum of all of that. <Sync id=""L309""time=""00:42:51""/>I would also say it's not all about iPhone in China. <Sync id=""L310""time=""00:42:54""/>The Services area grew double digit. <Sync id=""L311""time=""00:42:57""/>We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter or I should say some key gaming approvals. <Sync id=""L312""time=""00:43:03""/>It's not all about quantity but about which ones. <Sync id=""L313""time=""00:43:08""/>We saw that. <Sync id=""L314""time=""00:43:11""/>Also, Wearables, where Wearables are doing so great at a company level, they're doing even better in China. <Sync id=""L315""time=""00:43:17""/>And so lots of positives there. <Sync id=""L320""time=""00:43:44""/>Well, Shannon, we've gone through different cycles. <Sync id=""L321""time=""00:43:46""/>In some cases, our revenue growth exceeds our OpEx growth. <Sync id=""L322""time=""00:43:51""/>In other cases, like fiscal '19, it was the other way around. <Sync id=""L323""time=""00:43:55""/>But our approach frankly is not changing over time. <Sync id=""L324""time=""00:43:59""/>We want to invest in the business. <Sync id=""L325""time=""00:44:03""/>Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience, differentiate our products. <Sync id=""L326""time=""00:44:16""/>We continue to run SG&A tightly. <Sync id=""L327""time=""00:44:19""/>Obviously, if you look at what we've launched during the last few quarters and few years, we launched a lot of new products, and now we're launching a lot of new services. <Sync id=""L328""time=""00:44:30""/>And when we do that, we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services. <Sync id=""L329""time=""00:44:41""/>And that is what you're seeing, for example, in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as we're launching new services right now. <Sync id=""L330""time=""00:44:51""/>And so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches. <Sync id=""L339""time=""00:46:15""/>Toni, thanks for the question. <Sync id=""L340""time=""00:46:18""/>The guidance that we are providing, if you look at it at the midpoint, implies an acceleration of growth from the performance that we've seen during the course of fiscal '19. <Sync id=""L341""time=""00:46:33""/>As I said earlier, foreign exchange is clearly a headwind for us right now. <Sync id=""L342""time=""00:46:39""/>There's about $1.1 billion of negative foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id=""L343""time=""00:46:46""/>So that is something to keep in mind. <Sync id=""L344""time=""00:46:51""/>We feel very good, as Tim said, about the iPhone, the way the new cycle has started. <Sync id=""L345""time=""00:46:57""/>And we do expect an improvement in our year-over-year growth rate on iPhone. <Sync id=""L346""time=""00:47:04""/>Wearables has very, very strong momentum. <Sync id=""L347""time=""00:47:06""/>The portfolio of Services also has incredible momentum. <Sync id=""L348""time=""00:47:13""/>One thing to keep in mind as we look at this guidance range is the fact that we also contemplated the comparison to the launch of the iPad Pro a year ago for iPad as well as the new MacBook Air that was launched during the December quarter last year. <Sync id=""L349""time=""00:47:34""/>So for the iPad and Mac categories, you need to keep in mind that our launch timing is different on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id=""L357""time=""00:48:45""/>Let me cover that accounting issue first. <Sync id=""L358""time=""00:48:49""/>Obviously, we need to make some assumptions around the take rate of our customers on the -- on Apple TV+, right? <Sync id=""L359""time=""00:48:59""/>And we don't want to get into the details of that because we view those assumptions as confidential and competitively sensitive. <Sync id=""L360""time=""00:49:07""/>But you need to keep in mind that we contemplate a number of factors, including the fact that we have family sharing as part of the service, the fact that there are multiple device purchases, the geographic availability around the world, the availability of local content at the beginning of the service, how many people do we have with payment methods on file. <Sync id=""L361""time=""00:49:31""/>So we use all these things to make assumptions around what the take rate is going to be. <Sync id=""L362""time=""00:49:39""/>Obviously, those assumptions will possibly change over time as we get more information on how the customers behave. <Sync id=""L363""time=""00:49:47""/>We haven't launched the service yet. <Sync id=""L364""time=""00:49:49""/>We're going to start serving our customers tomorrow, so we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these different factors. <Sync id=""L365""time=""00:49:57""/>On the bundled question, Toni, we look at each service and decide what's best to do for it. <Sync id=""L366""time=""00:50:05""/>And on the TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for our users, and so that's what we're doing. <Sync id=""L367""time=""00:50:20""/>You can also see that on the other services, we're not doing that. <Sync id=""L368""time=""00:50:24""/>So it's not part of a broader pattern or -- although I wouldn't want to rule out for the future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time. <Sync id=""L369""time=""00:50:35""/>In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they're on upgrade plans and so forth. <Sync id=""L370""time=""00:50:54""/>And so to some degree, that exists today. <Sync id=""L371""time=""00:50:57""/>My perspective is that will grow in the future to larger numbers that will grow disproportionately. <Sync id=""L372""time=""00:51:08""/>And one of the things we're doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things that's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call. <Sync id=""L373""time=""00:51:23""/>And so we're cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis. <Sync id=""L374""time=""00:51:41""/>And we're committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today. <Sync id=""L377""time=""00:52:00""/>Thank you. <Sync id=""L383""time=""00:52:38""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L384""time=""00:52:40""/>Chris, I think that the price moves we've made have been smart and well-received and do show a level of elasticity. <Sync id=""L385""time=""00:52:51""/>But the most important thing by far is the product. <Sync id=""L386""time=""00:52:55""/>And I think we've got the best lineup we've ever had, and the customer response to the product, what the product does for them is really incredible. <Sync id=""L387""time=""00:53:05""/>And the photos I'm getting from many users around the world are just incredible that people are taking. <Sync id=""L388""time=""00:53:12""/>And so I think it's product first and then price sort of falls out of that. <Sync id=""L389""time=""00:53:18""/>And we did decide to be more aggressive. <Sync id=""L390""time=""00:53:24""/>And looking at the results in the early going, I think it was the right call. <Sync id=""L391""time=""00:53:30""/>In terms of emerging markets, we picked sort of locally relevant prices. <Sync id=""L392""time=""00:53:38""/>And in some cases where the dollar had become stronger, we took an exchange rate that would've reflected a while back instead of the current exchange rate. <Sync id=""L393""time=""00:53:53""/>And in other words, we tried to stay as close as we could to a local price point that we knew was effective for that particular market. <Sync id=""L394""time=""00:54:04""/>And those, in addition to the U.S. price that have gotten more of a discussion, have been extremely well-received. <Sync id=""L398""time=""00:54:45""/>We're paying some tariffs today, as you know, some that went into effect pre-September and some others that went into effect in September. <Sync id=""L399""time=""00:54:55""/>So we are paying some. <Sync id=""L400""time=""00:54:56""/>That's been comprehended. <Sync id=""L401""time=""00:54:59""/>But in general, my view is very positive in terms of how things are going. <Sync id=""L402""time=""00:55:05""/>And that positive view is obviously factored in our guidance as well, and just the tone, I think, has changed significantly. <Sync id=""L403""time=""00:55:18""/>And I have long thought that it was in both countries' best interest to get to an agreement that maybe initially doesn't solve everything but solves some things that each party may want and get to a better place than where we're at. <Sync id=""L404""time=""00:55:40""/>And I'm hopeful that that's where we're headed. <Sync id=""L410""time=""00:56:18""/>We're not going to give out projections on it, but I would tell you that we were really pleased with the number of people that entered the trial period. <Sync id=""L411""time=""00:56:29""/>People are just coming out of the 30-day trial period in the last few days or a week or so, and so it's really too early to tell what the conversion rate will be. <Sync id=""L412""time=""00:56:46""/>But I feel like we're off to a good start, and the -- most important of everything, the customer feedback to date has really been incredible, and we're very excited for the future of the service. <Sync id=""L417""time=""00:57:21""/>I think we -- because the Watch is relatively young, we haven't seen enough upgrade cycles to really establish a pattern as yet. <Sync id=""L418""time=""00:57:34""/>And as I've mentioned before, 3 out of 4 customers buying an Apple Watch currently or last quarter, I should say, were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. <Sync id=""L419""time=""00:57:45""/>And so there's still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard. <Sync id=""L420""time=""00:57:53""/>I do think the upgrade market will get larger over time but just don't have a current view as to how often and so forth. <Sync id=""L421""time=""00:58:05""/>On the AirPods, we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro. <Sync id=""L422""time=""00:58:16""/>But I would guess that one, particularly in the early going, will be people that have AirPods today and want to have a -- also have a pair for the times that they need noise cancellation. <Sync id=""L423""time=""00:58:31""/>Thank you, Samik. <Sync id=""L424""time=""00:58:33""/>A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple

id=""L200""time=""00:31:11""/>Congratulations on the quarter. <Sync id=""L201""time=""00:31:13""/>iPhone revenue trajectory did improve, but it still declined 9%. <Sync id=""L202""time=""00:31:17""/>So can you talk about the drivers that will allow you to get that category back to growth and if you think that's something that's realistic to expect in fiscal '20? <Sync id=""L207""time=""00:32:01""/>Great. <Sync id=""L208""time=""00:32:01""/>And Luca, on margins, guidance is consistent with September, but there's a lot going on under the covers. <Sync id=""L209""time=""00:32:08""/>Tariffs could expand in mid-December. <Sync id=""L210""time=""00:32:10""/>There's some impact from the TV+ bundle. <Sync id=""L211""time=""00:32:14""/>You have some big currency and commodity price moves. <Sync id=""L212""time=""00:32:16""/>So can you just talk about the gives and takes that land you at the December quarter gross margin guidance? <Sync id=""L225""time=""00:33:53""/>So Wearables category has been strong, and it's hard to believe it's now essentially the same size as Mac. <Sync id=""L226""time=""00:33:59""/>But related to Apple's initiatives in health care, do you think health-related features are a primary driver of Wearables growth? <Sync id=""L227""time=""00:34:07""/>And maybe conversely, how important is the rising installed base of Wearables and the data that's associated with that to the ongoing innovation within Apple Health? <Sync id=""L228""time=""00:34:19""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L243""time=""00:35:50""/>And then with the strong slate of content in Apple TV+, can you just talk about the strategy behind giving it away to those that are buying an applicable device versus charging for it? <Sync id=""L244""time=""00:36:01""/>And my congrats to Nancy and thank you. <Sync id=""L256""time=""00:37:07""/>I guess 2 questions from me as well. <Sync id=""L257""time=""00:37:08""/>First one, Tim, if you think about the Services business, you're less than $2 billion away from the targets you had laid out a few years back. <Sync id=""L258""time=""00:37:16""/>But I'm wondering if you think about the growth rates you've had in the business over the last several years, the high teens average, I think, how much of that do you think was driven by the installed base growing versus incremental monetization of the installed base? <Sync id=""L259""time=""00:37:28""/>And do you see that ratio essentially flipping or changing as you go forward? <Sync id=""L274""time=""00:39:10""/>Got it. <Sync id=""L275""time=""00:39:10""/>And then if I could just kind of go back to the Wearables discussion, I mean, and especially if you think about Apple Watch and AirPods. <Sync id=""L276""time=""00:39:15""/>Is there a sense or a way to think about what's the attach rate today to iOS devices for Apple Watch or AirPods? <Sync id=""L277""time=""00:39:22""/>I guess I'm just trying to understand, if I think about 900 million-plus iPhone installed base, what kind of penetration do you have at Wearables and how long could this one may be as you go forward? <Sync id=""L286""time=""00:40:47""/>First, Nancy, just want to send you our best wishes. <Sync id=""L287""time=""00:40:50""/>We'll definitely miss you. <Sync id=""L288""time=""00:40:52""/>I'm sure, I agree with Luca, you've been very instrumental over the years. <Sync id=""L290""time=""00:40:57""/>My questions though with regards to China. <Sync id=""L291""time=""00:41:01""/>And I don't know, Tim, if you can talk more about what you're seeing in China, the trends during the quarter, the reception specifically there to the iPhone. <Sync id=""L292""time=""00:41:10""/>Any thoughts on Hong Kong used to be a big market. <Sync id=""L293""time=""00:41:13""/>There's obviously some turmoil there. <Sync id=""L294""time=""00:41:14""/>So if can you just provide some more in China that will be helpful. <Sync id=""L316""time=""00:43:24""/>And then I'm curious, Luca, maybe you can talk a bit about how you think about operating expense growth. <Sync id=""L317""time=""00:43:29""/>It continues to grow significantly faster than revenue. <Sync id=""L318""time=""00:43:33""/>So I'm just curious as to where you're targeting the incremental spend. <Sync id=""L319""time=""00:43:37""/>And then is there a point at which we might just see some leverage? <Sync id=""L332""time=""00:45:08""/>I think this is for Luca, and then I have a follow-up as well. <Sync id=""L333""time=""00:45:12""/>If I look at your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance for revenues on a sequential basis, it's up about 36.5%. <Sync id=""L334""time=""00:45:22""/>Historically, fiscal Q4 to Q1 was up 50% or more. <Sync id=""L335""time=""00:45:27""/>And even last year, given that iPhone is a slower-growing product, you guided for revenues to be up 45% sequentially. <Sync id=""L336""time=""00:45:37""/>So given the enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch and the new Wearables products and the new Services, I guess the question is why is your guidance not stronger for Q1 on the top line? <Sync id=""L337""time=""00:45:59""/>And is that sort of a reflection of conservatism, given that there's a lot of uncertainty in the world and we certainly saw that last year? <Sync id=""L338""time=""00:46:08""/>Or are there other forces at work that we should be considering? <Sync id=""L350""time=""00:47:45""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L351""time=""00:47:47""/>And then if I could follow up. <Sync id=""L352""time=""00:47:50""/>Just on the bundling of Apple TV+. <Sync id=""L353""time=""00:47:54""/>I guess for you, Tim, this is really the first time we've seen a significant bundling of services offering and a hardware offering. <Sync id=""L354""time=""00:48:06""/>And I'm wondering if you view this as kind of a strategic advantage of Apple and whether we might see more hardware plus services offerings -- bundled offerings. <Sync id=""L355""time=""00:48:17""/>And ultimately, to you, do you ever believe that your hardware itself might be offered as a bundled service? <Sync id=""L356""time=""00:48:27""/>And maybe while we're on that, either you or Luca could give us the 30-second tutorial on how we should think about the deferred revenue accounting, approximately how much of the $60 are you going to be deferring and what's your expectation for attach rate on that? <Sync id=""L376""time=""00:51:52""/>And Nancy, our congratulations to you, too, and we're going to miss you. <Sync id=""L378""time=""00:52:03""/>My first question is about pricing and the effect of some of the lower price points for iPhone 11 as compared to last year. <Sync id=""L379""time=""00:52:12""/>And it looked like margins and the revenues did well on that. <Sync id=""L380""time=""00:52:18""/>And it also followed some price adjustments you made in emerging markets last year. <Sync id=""L381""time=""00:52:23""/>And obviously, we've seen some improvement in China as well. <Sync id=""L382""time=""00:52:25""/>So if you could talk about maybe what that tells us about pricing strategy in general and perhaps that you're willing to take a little more flexible approach to drive some elasticity if you think that's going to have a positive effect. <Sync id=""L395""time=""00:54:19""/>As a follow-on, perhaps you could talk about the potential for some of the tariffs that are upcoming. <Sync id=""L396""time=""00:54:28""/>What --

Quarterly revenue record for Retail, powered by growth in online store. 2. Amid the most challenging global environment in which Co. has ever operated its business, AAPL grew during qtr. 2. COVID-19 Response: 1. Contending with COVID-19 since Jan. 2. Before COVID-19 was on the horizon, Co. anticipated that 2Q20 was going to be prolific and energetic period for AAPL. 1. When pandemic did strike, teams succeeded in growing the business in introducing powerful new products and in meeting customers' needs, and they rose to the occasion in terms of meeting broader obligations to communities. 3. At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get Co.'s latest generation of devices manufactured and into customers' hands, worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of AAPL were also sourcing more than 30m masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they're donated to places of greatest need in every region worldwide. 4. While product teams were preparing to launch new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air and new iPhone SE, they were also working with suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5m face shields. 1. Continues to ship more than 1m of these every week to doctors, nurses and medical personnel on frontlines. 5. In a qtr. where Services teams achieved strong growth, which speaks to real durability of Services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center. 1. As Apple News reached 125m monthly active users, Co. elevated trusted information from reliable sources through special COVID-19 vertical. 2. Let customers skip payments without incurring interests on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many families. 3. Worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga, to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV. 4. Services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume as users relied on their devices to stay connected in new reality. 6. In software, at the same time that teams work with great creativity and excitement as Co. prepares to deliver first-ever all-online Worldwide Developers Conference later this qtr., they also worked with same creativity and speed to put together COVID-19 symptom checking website and app in partnership with CDC. 1. As of 04/30/20, app has been installed nearly 2m times and web tool has received over 3m unique visits. 2. This month, to accelerate contact tracing, launching joint effort with Google to enable to use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of virus with user privacy and security central to design. 7. Paired aforementioned programmatic efforts with broader strategy to give back where it's needed most. 1. Made major corporate donations to response efforts worldwide to support global citizen, and new fund for Americans experiencing food and security due to crisis. 1. When tallying these things up and considering ongoing two-to-one match for employee donations, Co.'s contributions to global response are significant, diverse and great source of pride for whole team. 2. Doing what Co. can to help employees, their families, and by extension, their communities, stay safe and well by modifying its operations where appropriate. 1. This extends to retail employees; they're Co.'s face to customers and instrumental part of business, and AAPL is compensating them normally despite store closures. 8. During a qtr. where circumstances evolved by the hour, Co. has been gratified by resilience and adaptability of global supply chain. 1. While Co. felt some temporary supply constraints in Feb., operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward March-end. 9. At this time of social distance, of shuttered schools and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, Co. has seen significant evidence that AAPL's products have taken renewed importance for customers. 1. Teachers and students worldwide are relying on Co.'s technology to teach, learn and stay connected with each other. 2. Co. is in process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including: 1. Tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada, Glasgow, Scotland, and Puerto Rico. 2. 100,000 to city of Los Angeles. 3. 350,000 to New York City. 3. Aforementioned is Co.'s largest educational iPad deployment ever. 4. Since early March, seen unprecedented demand for Pro Apps from students, enthusiasts and creative professionals. 1. Made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90 days for everyone. 2. Reaction has been overwhelming, driving software downloads and usage to record levels. 10. Doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from distance when necessary. 1. With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring, ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure. 2. Many hospitals like Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams. 1. This enables care teams to keep close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment. 3. Key Metrics: 1. Revenue $58.3b. 1. Product revenue $45b. 2. Performance of product business had three very different phases. 1. Based on Co.'s performance during first five weeks of qtr., AAPL was confident it was headed toward record 2Q at the very high end of expectations. 2. In next five weeks of qtr., as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, and demand for products within China. 1. This caused Co. to withdraw revenue guidance in Feb. 2. At that point, demand for products outside of China was still strong and in line with expectations. 3. During last three weeks of qtr., as virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including closure of all Co.'s retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13 and many channel partner points of sales worldwide, saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables. 3.

Global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient. 1. Shown consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19. 4. Continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross section of customers, including all-new iPhone SE. 1.

happened in China, we were having a really good January. <Sync id=""L191""time=""00:29:42""/>The lockdown started there toward the end of January as you know. <Sync id=""L192""time=""00:29:47""/>February, we saw a steep decline in demand. <Sync id=""L193""time=""00:29:52""/>We closed our stores in February. <Sync id=""L194""time=""00:29:57""/>As the lockdown completed in mid-February toward the second half of February, we began to open stores. <Sync id=""L195""time=""00:30:07""/>We opened them on a staggered basis. <Sync id=""L196""time=""00:30:10""/>That took about 30 days until mid-March. <Sync id=""L197""time=""00:30:14""/>And from a demand point of view, we saw an improvement in March over February. <Sync id=""L198""time=""00:30:21""/>And if you look at kind of where we are today, we've seen further improvement in April as compared to March. <Sync id=""L199""time=""00:30:30""/>And so that's China. <Sync id=""L200""time=""00:30:31""/>If you look at the rest of the world, we were doing great in January, the first 5 weeks of the quarter. <Sync id=""L201""time=""00:30:43""/>And we do believe that we were headed toward the sort of the top end of our expectations that we had talked to you about on the last call, that the next 5 weeks were spent sort of reacting and getting the supply chain back up in full force and working through the sharp decline in China that I already talked about. <Sync id=""L202""time=""00:31:11""/>The real thing for the rest of the world happened in March when the shelter-in-place orders went in and the work from home began. <Sync id=""L203""time=""00:31:19""/>For those 2-, 3-week period, at the end of the quarter, we saw a sharp decline in demand. <Sync id=""L204""time=""00:31:26""/>If you now step out into April and look at that, early April started like the end of March, but in the second half of April, we've seen an uptick across -- really across the board. <Sync id=""L205""time=""00:31:42""/>It's not just related to a certain geo or a certain product. <Sync id=""L206""time=""00:31:50""/>We think, by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products. <Sync id=""L207""time=""00:31:54""/>A part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more. <Sync id=""L208""time=""00:32:14""/>In particular for, as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter. <Sync id=""L209""time=""00:32:25""/>And that's customers that are either taking online education or working remotely. <Sync id=""L210""time=""00:32:34""/>And so complex answer to your question but that's what we're seeing. <Sync id=""L215""time=""00:32:59""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L216""time=""00:32:59""/>Well, Shannon, as we said, we manage the company for the long term, right? <Sync id=""L217""time=""00:33:05""/>So we know that the core of the business, the core of the company is innovation and product and services development, so we will continue to invest in our pipeline. <Sync id=""L218""time=""00:33:17""/>We're very excited about what we have in store, and so we will continue to invest there. <Sync id=""L219""time=""00:33:23""/>Obviously, we are aware of the environment, and so we will manage the SG&A portion of the company tightly. <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:33:33""/>We are making new investments in the new services that we launched recently. <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:33:39""/>We -- as you know, we purchased the baseband activities from Intel, and obviously, we want to develop that technology because we consider it's a core technology for us. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:33:52""/>And so we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like to manage the business wisely. <Sync id=""L224""time=""00:34:18""/>Tim, I think I speak for everyone on the call that we're all very appreciative of Apple's contribution during this pandemic. <Sync id=""L225""time=""00:34:25""/>We all appreciate it. <Sync id=""L226""time=""00:34:26""/>Thank you very much for that. <Sync id=""L227""time=""00:34:32""/>No, it's been great. <Sync id=""L228""time=""00:34:34""/>Tim, in past downturns, we have not really seen Apple pull back from investing, and you as a company have largely maintained the product introduction cadence. <Sync id=""L229""time=""00:34:44""/>But given these are unprecedented times and there are a lot of challenges associated with product development during a time when you have a global footprint for such activities and unable to really do a lot of things in person, how should we think about the product development and introduction cadence as we go over the next several quarters? <Sync id=""L230""time=""00:35:05""/>And I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L231""time=""00:35:06""/>Well, we're continuing to operate. <Sync id=""L232""time=""00:35:08""/>And so as you can tell, along with everything else going on, we were able to launch and ship the iPhone SE, the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard and the MacBook Air. <Sync id=""L233""time=""00:35:24""/>And so business continues and the new products are our lifeblood. <Sync id=""L234""time=""00:35:32""/>And so we're continuing to work. <Sync id=""L235""time=""00:35:35""/>Everybody is getting used to the work at home. <Sync id=""L236""time=""00:35:40""/>In some areas of the company, people may be even more productive. <Sync id=""L237""time=""00:35:46""/>In some other areas, they're not as productive, and so it's mixed depending upon what the roles are. <Sync id=""L238""time=""00:35:55""/>But as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that our customers want the products that we've got. <Sync id=""L239""time=""00:36:10""/>They are even more important in these times. <Sync id=""L240""time=""00:36:18""/>As a follow-up, I know you're doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers. <Sync id=""L241""time=""00:36:30""/>But I was wondering, would you consider using the strength of your balance sheet maybe a little differently structured, maybe deferred payments or things like that? <Sync id=""L242""time=""00:36:41""/>And -- or do you think that there could be other steps like bundling that you will consider versus what you already currently do? <Sync id=""L243""time=""00:36:48""/>Well, as you know, we launched the payment plan earlier on Apple Card for iPhone. <Sync id=""L244""time=""00:36:56""/>We're working on doing that for other products as well, and you'll see something on that shortly. <Sync id=""L245""time=""00:37:02""/>So we're very focused on the affordability point. <Sync id=""L246""time=""00:37:07""/>The trade-in programs also are fairly wide across the board and act as both something great for the environment, also something great from a way to get that entry price down. <Sync id=""L247""time=""00:37:24""/>In terms of deferred payments, nothing to announce today. <Sync id=""L248""time=""00:37:30""/>But as you know, having access to the Card, at least in the United States, gives us more degrees of freedom, and that is not using our balance sheet. <Sync id=""L249""time=""00:37:40""/>It's -- but we play a key role in deciding what kind of programs go with the Card. <Sync id=""L256""time=""00:38:29""/>I think there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are and -- for remote work. <Sync id=""L257""time=""00:38:38""/>And it's pretty clear to me that where things will get a lot closer to normal than they are today, obviously, I think many people are finding that they can learn remotely, and so I suspect that trend will accelerate some. <Sync id=""L258""time=""00:38:58""/>I think that's probably also true about working remotely on -- in some areas and in some jobs. <Sync id=""L259""time=""00:39:06""/>And so I think we have significant solutions and products for those -- for all of those groups. <Sync id=""L260""time=""00:39:17""/>On the health area, I gave some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the Watch. <Sync id=""L261""time=""00:39:25""/>You can bet that we're looking at other areas in this. <Sync id=""L262""time=""00:39:30""/>We were already doing that because we've viewed that, that area was a huge opportunity for the company and a way for us to help a lot of people. <Sync id=""L263""time=""00:39:41""/>And so you will see us continue on that. <Sync id=""L264""time=""00:39:45""/>I wouldn't say that the health door opened wider. <Sync id=""L265""time=""00:39:51""/>I would say it was already opened fairly wide. <Sync id=""L271""time=""00:40:25""/>Well, let me answer that, Katy. <Sync id=""L272""time=""00:40:30""/>First of all, on the buyback, as I said, in general, our approach to capital allocation has remained the same for the last several years, and it's not changing now. <Sync id=""L273""time=""00:40:41""/>Keep in mind here, we're talking about just the authorization, right? <Sync id=""L274""time=""00:40:44""/>And when you look at our actual results at the end of every quarter, you see how much we actually do in terms of share repurchases. <Sync id=""L275""time=""00:40:52""/>The $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still remaining from the past authorization that we've received from our Board, right? <Sync id=""L276""time=""00:41:04""/>So it's the total available or outstanding in terms of authorization is over $90 billion. <Sync id=""L277""time=""00:41:11""/>And as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you know that, that is a very adequate amount. <Sync id=""L278""time=""00:41:20""/>And as you know, we will provide an additional update a year from now. <Sync id=""L279""time=""00:41:25""/>So nothing really has changed there. <Sync id=""L280""time=""00:41:28""/>And nothing has changed on our approach for M&A. <Sync id=""L281""time=""00:41:32""/>We've been quite active over the last several years. <Sync id=""L282""time=""00:41:35""/>We purchase companies on a very regular basis. <Sync id=""L283""time=""00:41:39""/>We're always looking for ways to accelerate our product road maps or fill gaps in our portfolio, both on the hardware side, on the software side, on the Services side. <Sync id=""L284""time=""00:41:53""/>So we will continue to do that. <Sync id=""L285""time=""00:41:57""/>And so also on the M&A front, nothing has changed. <Sync id=""L290""time=""00:42:37""/>Amit, it's Tim. <Sync id=""L291""time=""00:42:41""/>If you look at the iPhone channel inventory during Q2, the reduction of it was more than the reduction from the previous year. <Sync id=""L292""time=""00:42:51""/>It's not unusual that we reduce in Q2, and in fact, if you look back on -- generally speaking, in the first half of the calendar year, we reduce channel inventories. <Sync id=""L293""time=""00:43:06""/>During the second half of the calendar year, we generally raise channel inventories. <Sync id=""L294""time=""00:43:11""/>That's a seasonal thing. <Sync id=""L295""time=""00:43:13""/>And I believe -- sitting here today, I believe that will happen this year as well. <Sync id=""L296""time=""00:43:21""/>So hopefully, that answers your question. <Sync id=""L297""time=""00:43:22""/>And by the way, we ended in a comfortable position, so you could conclude from that, that we were within a target range. <Sync id=""L303""time=""00:43:58""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L304""time=""00:43:59""/>As you know, our supply chain is global and so our products are truly made everywhere. <Sync id=""L305""time=""00:44:05""/>And I would focus on that versus focus on one element of the manufacturing process, which tends to get more visibility, which is the final assembly. <Sync id=""L306""time=""00:44:19""/>We have some final assembly in the United States. <Sync id=""L307""time=""00:44:22""/>We have final assembly in China as well. <Sync id=""L308""time=""00:44:26""/>I think you'd have to conclude or at least I conclude that if you look at the shock to the supply chain that took place this quarter, for it to come back up so quickly really demonstrates that it's durable and resilient. <Sync id=""L309""time=""00:44:45""/>And so I feel good about where we are. <Sync id=""L310""time=""00:44:50""/>That said, we're always looking at tweaks, and it's just not something we talk about because we view it as confidential and competitive information. <Sync id=""L311""time=""00:45:00""/>And so we will look at the -- as we get out of this totally, we will look to see what we learned and what we should change. <Sync id=""L318""time=""00:45:47""/>Jeriel, let me take that one. <Sync id=""L319""time=""00:45:51""/>We typically don't give a lot of specifics about our categories. <Sync id=""L320""time=""00:45:57""/>But I've said, as we look into the June quarter, we see 2 distinct trends in our Services business overall. <Sync id=""L321""time=""00:46:08""/>Our ecosystem is very strong. <Sync id=""L322""time=""00:46:11""/>Our customers are very engaged. <Sync id=""L323""time=""00:46:13""/>We are continuing to grow double digits the number of transacting accounts and paid accounts. <Sync id=""L324""time=""00:46:20""/>And so we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter. <Sync id=""L325""time=""00:46:30""/>And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our Music business, cloud services, so we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly. <Sync id=""L326""time=""00:46:41""/>Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are 2 businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter. <Sync id=""L327""time=""00:46:54""/>One of them is Apple Care. <Sync id=""L328""time=""00:46:56""/>Apple Care is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchased our devices. <Sync id=""L329""time=""00:47:09""/>Both these businesses have been affected obviously by the store closures, not only our retail stores but also our partners' points of sale. <Sync id=""L330""time=""00:47:20""/>And obviously, they reduced level of customer traffic because of the social distancing measures, right? <Sync id=""L331""time=""00:47:26""/>And we do expect Apple Care to be affected during the June quarter. <Sync id=""L332""time=""00:47:31""/>The other business which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, on Apple News and the third-party agreements that we have on the advertising front. <Sync id=""L333""time=""00:47:56""/>So these are 2 things that, during the June quarter, will create a headwind for the Services business. <Sync id=""L340""time=""00:48:39""/>I haven't seen what you're asking, no. <Sync id=""L341""time=""00:48:43""/>I have seen a strong customer response to iPhone SE, which is our most affordable iPhone. <Sync id=""L342""time=""00:48:52""/>But it appears that those customers are primarily coming from wanting a smaller form factor with the latest technology or coming over from Android. <Sync id=""L343""time=""00:49:08""/>And so those are the 2 principal kind of segments versus somebody buying down as you're talking about it. <Sync id=""L344""time=""00:49:19""/>We've also seen -- we launched the iPad Pro in the midst of all of this, and the reception there has also been incredibly good. <Sync id=""L345""time=""00:49:28""/>And that's obviously our top-of-the-line iPad. <Sync id=""L346""time=""00:49:32""/>And so I'm not seeing what you're alluding to at least at this point. <Sync id=""L351""time=""00:50:13""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L352""time=""00:50:13""/>What we saw in China for the full quarter, and I'll speak about Mainland China because I think that's the source of your question, we saw strong results in iPad and in Wearables and in Services. <Sync id=""L353""time=""00:50:33""/>And if you look up underneath the full quarter, we saw a strong January and then a significantly reduced demand in February as the shelter-in-place orders and the lockdowns went into effect in China and the stores closed. <Sync id=""L354""time=""00:50:59""/>And then in March, as stores reopened, we -- the recovery began, and then we've seen further recovery in April. <Sync id=""L355""time=""00:51:09""/>Where that goes, we will see, but that's kind of what we've seen so far there. <Sync id=""L356""time=""00:51:17""/>To your question about store traffic, store traffic is obviously up from where it was in February, but it is not back to where it was pre the lockdown. <Sync id=""L357""time=""00:51:33""/>There has been, however, more move to online. <Sync id=""L358""time=""00:51:39""/>And as I'd mentioned earlier in my remarks, the -- it's pretty phenomenal actually. <Sync id=""L359""time=""00:51:48""/>Retail had a quarterly record for us during the quarter, and that's despite stores being closed for the 3-week period around the world ex China and then China was closed prior to that 3 weeks. <Sync id=""L360""time=""00:52:05""/>And that's partly because the online store had such a phenomenal quarter, and that included in China but it was also other regions as well. <Sync id=""L361""time=""00:52:19""/>So there is definitely a move. <Sync id=""L362""time=""00:52:22""/>And whether that's a permanent shift, I would hesitate to go that far as I think people like to be out and about. <Sync id=""L363""time=""00:52:36""/>They just know that now is not the time to do that. <Sync id=""L366""time=""00:53:04""/>I think it plays in every geo, but I would expect to see it doing even better in areas where the median incomes are less. <Sync id=""L367""time=""00:53:18""/>And so we'll see how that plays out. <Sync id=""L368""time=""00:53:21""/>And I expect some fair number of people switching over to iOS. <Sync id=""L369""time=""00:53:28""/>And so it's an unbelievable offer. <Sync id=""L370""time=""00:53:33""/>It's, if you will, the engine of our top phones in a very affordable package. <Sync id=""L371""time=""00:53:43""/>And I think -- and it's faster than the fastest Android phones, and so it's an exceptional value. <Sync id=""L377""time=""00:54:41""/>Chris, we've always been about delivering the best product at a good price, and that fundamental strategy has not changed at all. <Sync id=""L378""time=""00:54:57""/>As you know, we did have an SE for a while. <Sync id=""L379""time=""00:54:59""/>It's great to bring it back. <Sync id=""L380""time=""00:55:02""/>It was a beloved product, and so I wouldn't read anything into that other than we want to give people the best deal that we can while making the best product. <Sync id=""L384""time=""00:55:44""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L385""time=""00:55:45""/>For March, Chris, we saw NAND pricing increase slightly, while DRAM and displays and the other commodities declined. <Sync id=""L386""time=""00:55:56""/>For the June quarter, we would expect NAND and DRAM pricing to remain at this historically low level, while displays and most other commodity prices, we expect to decline.","<Sync id=""L184""time=""00:29:10""/>I hope everyone is well. <Sync id=""L185""time=""00:29:13""/>Tim, you talked about seeing some improvement in the second half of April. <Sync id=""L186""time=""00:29:15""/>So I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a bit more on the segment and geographic basis what you're seeing in the various regions that you're selling in and what you're hearing from your customers. <Sync id=""L187""time=""00:29:28""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L211""time=""00:32:42""/>That was helpful. <Sync id=""L212""time=""00:32:44""/>Luca, unless I missed it, you talked about various puts and takes in the quarter but didn't really discuss operating expenses. <Sync id=""L213""time=""00:32:50""/>I know you mentioned some cost savings on the COGS line. <Sync id=""L214""time=""00:32:52""/>I'm curious how you're thinking about your spending in OpEx given some of the macro challenges that you may be facing. <Sync id=""L251""time=""00:38:00""/>I hope the whole team is staying healthy and safe. <Sync id=""L252""time=""00:38:04""/>Tim, I want to start on a longer-term question. <Sync id=""L253""time=""00:38:08""/>Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might present opportunities for new revenue streams at Apple? <Sync id=""L254""time=""00:38:17""/>And I'm particularly thinking about your past comments on health and augmented reality, but I'm sure there's even more areas of inspiration and creativity coming out of the company. <Sync id=""L255""time=""00:38:27""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L266""time=""00:39:57""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L267""time=""00:39:57""/>And then as a follow-up, the $50 billion share repurchase authorization is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower than the last couple of years. <Sync id=""L268""time=""00:40:08""/>So just any context around the thought process of landing on $50 billion? <Sync id=""L269""time=""00:40:14""/>And then related to that, you have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world. <Sync id=""L270""time=""00:40:18""/>Does the current environment change your thinking at all around M&A opportunities? <Sync id=""L287""time=""00:42:17""/>I have 2 as well. <Sync id=""L288""time=""00:42:19""/>I guess, first off, on the channel inventory, I was hoping if you could talk about how did channel inventory look like in the March quarter because it sounds like it may be below the historical ranges. <Sync id=""L289""time=""00:42:28""/>And then the discussion you had for June quarter performance of iPhones, what are you embedding from a channel building back inventory levels in that expectation? <Sync id=""L298""time=""00:43:34""/>That's really helpful. <Sync id=""L299""time=""00:43:35""/>And could I just follow up? <Sync id=""L300""time=""00:43:36""/>Tim, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about how do you think about Apple's manufacturing strategy and perhaps need for some diversity, especially given everything the company and everyone has gone through over the last 12 months. <Sync id=""L301""time=""00:43:48""/>How do you think about that? <Sync id=""L302""time=""00:43:50""/>And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional fall products that they used to get from Apple? <Sync id=""L313""time=""00:45:22""/>So I want to focus the question on Services. <Sync id=""L314""time=""00:45:27""/>The segment was solid in the quarter in spite overall macro weakness. <Sync id=""L315""time=""00:45:31""/>I can kind of see launch behind it being strong despite product weakness overall. <Sync id=""L316""time=""00:45:37""/>As you kind of look at the rest of the year, do you think that's sustained? <Sync id=""L317""time=""00:45:40""/>Or at some point, does the macro impacts worldwide impact the Services line? <Sync id=""L334""time=""00:48:06""/>Got it. <Sync id=""L335""time=""00:48:07""/>Appreciate that. <Sync id=""L336""time=""00:48:08""/>My second question comes about the overall purchasing decisions consumers are making. <Sync id=""L337""time=""00:48:14""/>So far through April, have you seen increased perhaps downticks across your product line? <Sync id=""L338""time=""00:48:20""/>So for example, somebody might have a shift maybe towards the lower end of the storage mix of certain products. <Sync id=""L339""time=""00:48:28""/>And do you expect that going forward as unemployment uptick and macro impacts kind of layer on through rest of '20? <Sync id=""L348""time=""00:49:53""/>So if I can just start with a question on kind of what you're seeing in China, you mentioned kind of the pickup in activity. <Sync id=""L349""time=""00:50:01""/>But is that driven by more kind of footfall in the stores or what you're seeing relative to online activity and how much of this recovery is driven online? <Sync id=""L350""time=""00:50:11""/>Any thoughts on that, please? <Sync id=""L364""time=""00:52:40""/>Got it. <Sync id=""L365""time=""00:52:41""/>And if I can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand you're seeing for iPhone SE, just given the price point, I'm wondering if you're expecting any change in terms of the geographic mix of where the demand comes from relative to typically what you see for other iPhones in the lineup just given the lower price point. <Sync id=""L373""time=""00:54:06""/>I wanted to follow up with another question on iPhone SE and the decision to bring it back and where it sits within the total iPhone strategy. <Sync id=""L374""time=""00:54:17""/>And I guess coupled with the fact that iPhone 11, you made the decision to bring that at a lower price point, what does that tell us with respect to your approach to iPhone pricing and flexibility? <Sync id=""L375""time=""00:54:30""/>Is this helping to add users and kind of bring people into the ecosystem? <Sync id=""L376""time=""00:54:38""/>And if so, what does that imply for gross margins? <Sync id=""L381""time=""00:55:22""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L382""time=""00:55:22""/>As a follow-up, the follow-up question is on commodity pricing, and I think you had expected to see some commodity price declines through the March quarter. <Sync id=""L383""time=""00:55:33""/>If you could talk about what you expect as you go through the year perhaps in this new environment and again, whether that turned into a tailwind or a headwind for gross margins as you go into the second half. <Sync id=""L387""time=""00:56:09""/>Thank you, Chris. <Sync id=""L388""time=""00:56:16""/>A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple

Amit, it's Tim. If you look at the Apple -- or the Wearables as a category within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, Wearables grew 44%, so it was very strong, as you say. The -- both Apple Watch and AirPods did very well in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch, in particular, 75% of the customers are new to the Apple Watch, and so it's still very much selling to new customers at this point. Yes, that's right, Amit. It's about flat sequentially and, by the way, significantly higher on a year-over-year basis. But on a sequential basis, you're right. On one side, we got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality, but we expect that, that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings. Tom, it's Tim. We are primarily measuring ourselves on the number of subscribers. As you can tell from the way that we launched the product, we started with a very aggressive price at $4.99. And in addition to that, we have our bundle, where if you buy pretty much any device, you're getting a year for free, and so we're very focused on subscribers. That said, our -- the product itself is about storytelling. And we think if we do that well, then we'll find that there will be some number of those that will also be critically acclaimed and we're seeing that with The Morning Show. We're seeing that with Little America and others. The retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double-digit growth in iPhone from a year-over-year point of view. And one of the factors that enabled that was the -- getting to monthly payments on the Apple Card to make it very simple. Of course, that's U.S.-only at this point, but the U.S. is a very key market for us. And so it was an important part of it. Yes. Thanks, Shannon. In terms of China, the results from last quarter and then I'll get into the coronavirus second. For the results from last quarter, we had double-digit growth for iPhone in Mainland China, so that was an important change from where we had been running. We also had double-digit growth in Services in Mainland China, and we had extremely strong double-digit on Wearables. And so really, there were a number of different factors. In terms of the things that customers are responding to, iPhone 11 is doing particularly well there. The product has been very well received with its battery life, and the camera is unbelievable. We also, as you probably know, have certain trade-in programs going and financing programs. These have also been well-received. And so it's sort of the sum of all of this, and we're attracting quite a large percentage of new customers on products like the Mac. 3/4 of the customers buying a Mac in China are new, and nearly 2/3 of the customers buying iPad are new. And so it was a terrific quarter. We had 3 of the top 4 selling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar. In terms of the coronavirus, as I mentioned earlier, first and foremost, our thoughts are with all of those that are affected across the region. And as I've mentioned, we're donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We're also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week. The situation is emerging, and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely. As Luca had mentioned, we have a wider-than-usual revenue range for the second quarter due to the greater uncertainty. I'll talk about supply chain and customer demand some to give you some color. With respect to the supply chain, we do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. All of these suppliers, there are alternate sources, and we're obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss. We factored our best thinking in the guidance that we provided you. With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time. The reopening of those factories after Chinese New Year has been moved from the end of this month to February 10, depending upon the supplier location. And we've attempted to account for this delayed start-up through our larger range of outcomes that Luca mentioned earlier. With respect to customer demand and sales, we've currently closed 1 of our retail stores, and a number of channel partners have also closed their storefronts. Many of the stores that remain open have also reduced operating hours. We're taking additional precautions and frequently deep cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees. While our sales within the Wuhan area itself are small, retail traffic has also been impacted outside of this area across the country in the last few days. And again, we have attempted to account for this in our guidance range that we've provided you. I hope that gives you some color. Yes. As I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment. Most commodities have been declining during the December quarter, and we expect the same to happen in the March quarter. As always and as you probably know, we look at the way these prices move. And at times when we feel it's appropriate, we buy certain commodities in advance. And so we will continue that practice as we go through the year. Katy, let me make a couple of comments here. The 17% during the December quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year '19 growth rate, which was 16%, so we feel very good about the results for the December quarter. As Tim and I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it was a very broad-based growth because we grew double digits in Services across all the 5 geographies. We set all-time records for many, many categories, music, cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store and AppleCare. If you remember, we had set 2 goals for ourselves in the Services segment. First, we set a goal to double our fiscal '16 revenue during 2020, and when we look at it on a run rate basis, we've already achieved that goal with the results for the December quarter. We also set a goal to pass 500 million paid subscriptions during 2020. And given that we are already at 480 million at the end of December, we expect to pass that mark during the March quarter. And so now we are setting a new target for ourselves for paid subscriptions. And so we are now aiming to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. So we feel that the Services business is growing incredibly well. Of course, we have launched new services very recently. For example, Apple TV+ just launched in November. And so while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time, these are contributing to the growth of the Services business. But we feel very happy with the 17%. We don't comment on future products, and so I'll try to sidestep a bit. With respect to 5G, I think it's -- and we're in the early innings of its deployment on a global basis. We obviously couldn't be prouder of our lineup and is -- and are very excited about our pipeline as well and wouldn't trade our position for anybody. I think that we've had some great partners not only in the U.S. but also around the world that were really helpful this quarter as partners. And so I think that probably a part of that is the level of investments they have, and then a part of it is probably making sure that those customers stick with them in an environment where there's a lot of trading back and forth. So I'm optimistic that it will continue. I'm hopeful that the Series 3 will come into balance during this quarter. On AirPods Pro, I don't have an estimate for that for you. I just can't predict when at this point where -- we seem to be fairly substantially off there, and we're working very hard to put in additional capacity. Tim, Apple has a very valuable installed base of users. Can you see a future where Apple can become larger in the advertising market as you build out TV+, given you could have the unique position and ability to drive targeted ads to users without compromising on privacy? I think it's -- I think it is possible to have advertising in a straightforward manner that doesn't encroach on people's privacy. I wouldn't want to conjecture about us in that business. I think for the TV+ business, we feel strongly that what that customer wants is an ad-free product, and so that's not our aversion to ads, it's what we believe that the customer wants. Okay. And Luca, can you just clarify if the Services revenue this quarter had any impact of deferrals associated with TV+ at all? And how can you help us maybe size the impact of the amortization of the content cost associated with TV+ as we think about the next couple of years? Yes. So yes, of course, we launched the service, and so there was a very small contribution to revenue from the deferral. And there was also a contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually paying for the service. When you think about what goes into the Apple TV+ revenue, at this point, there are 2 components: the paid subscribers, these are the customers that pay for the service and we recognize revenue over the subscription period; and then we've got the what we call the Apple TV+ bundle subscribers, these are the customers that buy an eligible hardware device and redeem the offer for a free year of TV+ services. We defer revenue for this offer based on 3 items. The first one is the value of the service that is being provided, the 1-year of Apple TV+. The second one is the number of customers that are eligible for the offer, and the third one is our estimate of the expected number of customers that will redeem the offer. So you need to keep in mind that from our total eligible device sales, you need to make a number of reductions for family sharing, for multiple device purchases and for geographic availability. Also the take rate can also be impacted by the availability of local content, and we also require a payment method on file. So this estimate is reviewed quarterly and gets updated based on actual trends of the offer. And so these inputs provide us with the amount of revenue that we defer for each device sale that then gets recognized over the 1-year period that the TV+ service is provided. And so when you take the combination of pay subscribers and bundled subscribers, you get the Apple TV+ revenue. Of course, because we launched the service very recently, the amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter was immaterial to our results. With regard to the cost of the service, of developing the content, we -- essentially, as we incur these costs, we put them on the balance sheet, and then we amortize them over a certain period of time depending on the type of content that we produce. Again, I want to stay away from commenting about future products. But generally, I think it's important when you think about 5G is to look around the world at the different deployment schedules. And some of those look very different perhaps than what you might be seeing here. And so that's very important. In terms of the price, I wouldn't want to comment on the price of handsets that aren't announced. Yes. I think we felt good about our OpEx results because they were at the low end of our guidance range. But clearly, we want to make all the necessary investments in the business. And from -- in terms of the new services, not only for TV+ but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is a period where we're making the necessary investments in advertising and marketing, and that level of investment is reflected in our OpEx results. And also, as you correctly stated, we completed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business during the December quarter. And so we had -- we reflected the run rate of the expenses related to that business partially during the quarter after the completion of the transaction. And we -- that is a very important core technology for the company, so we will continue to make all the necessary investments also there. There is a third category of expenses that affected the December quarter and is the fact that our revenue was very strong, and we have certain variable expenses, for example, credit card fees that are associated with higher volume and, of course, impacted our OpEx results. I think that -- Michael, it's Tim. With each Apple product that a customer buys, I think they get tighter into the ecosystem because they like -- that's the reason that they're buying into it, is they like the experience, the customer experience. And so from that point of view, I think each of our products can drive another product. I would think in that case, it's more likely that the iPhone comes first, but there's no doubt in my mind that there's some people that came into the ecosystem for the Watch. I think when you look at AR today, you would see that there are consumer applications, there are enterprise applications. This is the reason I'm so excited about it, is you rarely have a new technology where business and consumer are both -- most see it as key to them. And so I think it's -- the answer is that that's the reason that I think it's going to pervade your life, is because it's going to go across both business and your home life. And I think these things will happen in parallel. There are already companies that are deep into the enterprise business that are working on applications for the enterprise. And of course, you can see -- you can go on the store and see thousands of apps that are ARKit-enabled at this time and with even more coming. Yes. I think that the mix helped us both in Q1, and it's helping us with the guidance for Q2. And as you said, some of it is mix of iPhones. The customer response for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max has been exceptional, and that clearly has helped our mix. iPhone 11 was our top-selling model throughout the quarter, every single week of the quarter. And so certainly, better mix within iPhone. The other point that I'd like to point out is that as we move from Q1 to Q2, the proportion of revenue coming from Services increases versus the holiday quarter. And given the fact that Services are accretive to gross margin for the company, we end up getting a better mix from Services as well. Well, I would start by saying that our expense to revenue ratio is incredibly competitive relative to other companies in our sector. There are years when our OpEx grows faster than our revenue, but we've also had years in the recent past where the opposite has happened. We continue to believe that we have a lot of great opportunities in front of us. And just if you look at this past year, we launched many new initiatives, for example, on the Services front, which we want to support with the appropriate level of investment, not only marketing and advertising but also in R&D. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business because we think it's a very important strategic core technology for the company going forward. And I think from the results that you've seen during this quarter and the guidance that we provided during -- for the March quarter, I think we're doing a pretty good job at balancing the level of investments that we are making on the expense front with the level of returns that we get, both in terms of revenue and in terms of profitability that we're getting. Our net income, for example, was up 11% during the December quarter. We have a practice of forecasting the current quarter, and so we've given you the range that we expect for the current quarter and really don't give a range beyond that. Yes. So Japan was down 10% during the December quarter, was primarily due to iPhone performance, which was challenged because there were some regulatory changes that took effect on the 1st of October, where essentially, the regulators decoupled the mobile phone pricing from the 2-year contracts and are capping the maximum amount of carrier discounts that can be made. At the same time, I would say, within a more difficult macro environment, iPhone did incredibly well during the quarter. 6 of the top 7 selling smartphone models in Japan during the December quarter were iPhones. So it was a very strong performance by iPhone in a difficult environment. Also, in Japan, we had very strong double-digit growth from Services, stronger than company average, and very strong double-digit growth in Wearables, also stronger than company average. So we feel very good. Japan is a country where it's starting to -- we've had great success. The customers are very loyal and very engaged, and we have a very strong position there, and we feel we have a very good momentum.","I guess first one for me. On Wearables, fairly impressive to see it's already a $10 billion business for you guys. Can you just touch on the growth that you see on the Wearables side? How much of the growth do you think is coming from first-time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have? Because it looks to us adoption rates are fairly low in your installed base so there should be a long runway, but love to just understand how you see the growth divided between those 2 buckets. Perfect. And I guess, Luca, if you could just touch on gross margins. The March quarter guide, I think, implies gross margins are flat to actually up 10, 15 basis points. It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March, I think, because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening. So what are the offsets that's enabling what looks like a better-than-seasonal guide for gross margins? Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please? Great. So congrats on the launch of Apple TV+. I wanted to know internally how you are gauging success. Is it purely on critical acclaim? Is it on number of consumers that are using the service, contribution of service revenue, et cetera, et cetera? Great. And then my second question is, I think you indicated that last month, you started offering consumers the ability to use their Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis. Can you talk about how that's had an impact on your unit sales for iPhones? Thank you, Tom. Can we have the next question, please? I wanted to go back to revisit China. Tim, can you talk about what you're seeing in the region -- what you were seeing in the region prior to the health crisis? And then can you also update us a bit in terms of your manufacturing strategy, dual sourcing, geographic diversification even within the region just so we have some idea of how this will be managed? Yes, that was really helpful. Luca, maybe if you could just touch on, from a gross margin perspective, the commodity pricing environment and availability. Obviously, there's been some movement on DRAM and NAND. So if you can talk about how you're thinking about inventory levels and managing that going forward. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please? Luca, can you address the modest slowdown in Services growth this quarter, 17% versus 18% in September? Which Services categories accelerated versus where did you see some deceleration in the growth? Tim, as a follow-up, at some point in the future, Apple will launch a 5G iPhone. How big of a demand driver do you view 5G capability in a handset? And what's your view as to what the killer app will be from a consumer perspective? So we're seeing some signs of new spectrum being deployed for 5G deployments and even additional 4G capacity, and it's already having a positive impact for handset upgrades to use that new capacity. Do you get the sense that wireless carriers are getting more incentivized to upgrade handsets to get leverage out of these new network investments? How much might this be helping? And do you think it will continue to accelerate? Okay, great. And then the comment that you made about capacity in your Wearables division with AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 3, what should we think about the time line of when those capacity constraints might be alleviated? And will they come from capacity additions or the natural workout of kind of unit shipments and something on the demand side? Thanks, Kyle. Can we have the next question, please? Congrats on the great results. I had 2 questions. First one, Tim, I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on the overall smartphone market. There's a general view that when 5G phones come out, they're going to be more expensive due to higher component costs. But at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low-cost geographies with phones like iPhone SE. So how do you see these 2 different segments within the smartphone market evolving over the next 1 to 3 years? And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Got it. No worries, Tim. And then a follow-up for Luca. OpEx as a percentage of sales for March looks like about 15% higher than in your prior quarters. Kind of curious, how much of that, as part of it, is driven by some of your Intel modem asset purchases or TV+ in the OpEx? Or how do we think about it on a go-forward basis? Thanks, Krish. Can we have the next question, please? So a slightly different take on an earlier question on Wearables, and that is, what impact do you think Wearables is having on driving people into the Apple ecosystem? You mentioned 75% of watch buyers are new to the Apple Watch, but are many of them new to Apple overall? I'm sure a lot of existing iPhone, iPad or Mac users are going to be Wearables customers, but do you think Wearables bring people into the ecosystem to buy other devices in a material way? Yes. And then I think you recently mentioned that augmented reality will pervade our entire lives. And I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts about how you think it starts to impact our lives most significantly. For example, will the inflection point in AR come from gaming or industrial usage or some other category? In other words, where will the average person kind of first feel the impact of AR on their lives in a significant way? Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question, please? I guess the first question is on gross margins, and you spoke about the favorable mix. Wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. And clearly, iPhone is doing well within the overall mix, growing year-on-year. But if you could talk about what's happening to the mix within iPhone. Is that improving as well and also helping margins? And is there anything else you would point to with regard to the overall mix in margins? Okay. And I guess a follow-on question with regard to OpEx, and it has been growing at a faster rate than revenue for, I guess, largely over the last 3 years or so. Can you set us some expectation with regard to when you get a return on that investment? I understand there are new investments that are happening now. But how should we think about potential leverage going forward? Is there a point in time where the OpEx spending tend to level off and you get some return on that? Or is it just a function of faster revenue growth in the future? Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Just wanted to kind of ask on the iPhone revenue growth and definitely good to see it return to growth. Based on the velocity or momentum you're seeing for the products exiting the quarter, how comfortable are you feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone revenues through the year? And I have a follow-up. Okay. So if I can just maybe then follow up in terms of, obviously, you've returned to growth in most of the regions you report. One of the regions that are declining is Japan, so if you can share your thoughts on what actions you need to take there to return that segment -- that geography to growth. And what are the product trends there? What's probably the headwind that's kind of limiting growth there? Thank you, Samik.

In Australia, we had 5 of the top 6. And in Japan, we had the top 4. Urban China, we were -- iPhone 11 was the top-selling smartphone in the country. <Sync id=""L185""time=""00:29:09""/>And so these are some very different geographies with very different competitive situations and we're doing fairly well. <Sync id=""L186""time=""00:29:18""/>The iPhone SE, it's also clear that from the early data, we're seeing a higher switcher number than we did in the previous year, which we feel very good about. <Sync id=""L187""time=""00:29:30""/>And it also seemed to appeal to some people that were holding onto the device a little longer because they wanted a smaller form factor phone. <Sync id=""L188""time=""00:29:39""/>And so the combination of the smaller form factor and an incredibly affordable price made the iPhone SE very popular. <Sync id=""L189""time=""00:29:49""/>iPhone 11 is still the most popular smartphone, but iPhone SE definitely helped our results. <Sync id=""L190""time=""00:29:57""/>And as we -- as Lucas said in his outlook, we do see that continuing into this quarter currently. <Sync id=""L197""time=""00:30:50""/>I'm sorry. <Sync id=""L198""time=""00:30:50""/>I missed that second question because the audio didn't come through. <Sync id=""L199""time=""00:30:53""/>But I think I got to -- just to the first, and that is production has been affected for Apple TV+, as I think it has for most people. <Sync id=""L200""time=""00:31:06""/>We are working to get restarted. <Sync id=""L201""time=""00:31:09""/>I don't have a precise date yet when we will get restarted, but there will be some impact because we shut down in the March time frame and are yet to really restart in a significant way particularly for those that are shot in the L.A. area given the current status of the virus in this -- and I'm sorry, I missed your -- the second part of your question. <Sync id=""L205""time=""00:31:53""/>We're not updating today. <Sync id=""L206""time=""00:31:55""/>We feel good. <Sync id=""L207""time=""00:31:56""/>We want to take the moment and feel good about achieving the doubling 6 months early. <Sync id=""L208""time=""00:32:04""/>And we do have, still hanging out there, as you know, the subscription number that we're shooting for later in the year at 600 million. <Sync id=""L209""time=""00:32:15""/>So we do have that objective out there. <Sync id=""L214""time=""00:32:34""/>As I said when I was talking about providing some commentary for the September quarter, we expect all the non-iPhone product categories to have a very strong year-over-year performance. <Sync id=""L215""time=""00:32:48""/>So we definitely -- I mean the back-to-school season is clearly this one. <Sync id=""L216""time=""00:32:54""/>And we're very excited not only for the Mac but also for the iPad. <Sync id=""L217""time=""00:33:00""/>We got a fantastic lineup of products, and we know that these products are incredibly relevant especially given the current circumstances. <Sync id=""L218""time=""00:33:11""/>So we expect the performance that we've seen for Mac in the June quarter to continue. <Sync id=""L224""time=""00:33:45""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L225""time=""00:33:46""/>Shannon, the growth that -- we did see growth in Greater China for the quarter of 2%. <Sync id=""L226""time=""00:33:53""/>Currency affected China a bit more than in other places. <Sync id=""L227""time=""00:33:57""/>It affected 400 basis points, and so in constant currency, we would have grown at 6%. <Sync id=""L228""time=""00:34:04""/>As I'd mentioned before, the iPhone 11 has been our best-selling phone and has been #1 in Urban China, and so we're very, very proud of that. <Sync id=""L229""time=""00:34:16""/>iPad was helped in the June quarter there by the work-from-home and distance learning as it was in other geographies, and the Mac also grew strong double digit during the quarter. <Sync id=""L230""time=""00:34:35""/>And Services set a new June quarter record there. <Sync id=""L231""time=""00:34:40""/>We also continue to see extremely high new customer rates on Mac and iPad there. <Sync id=""L232""time=""00:34:47""/>To give you a perspective, about 3 out of 4 customers that are buying the Mac are new in China, and about 2 out of 3 that are buying the iPad are new. <Sync id=""L233""time=""00:34:58""/>And so these are numbers that we're super proud of. <Sync id=""L236""time=""00:35:20""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L237""time=""00:35:20""/>I mean what we wound up -- what we'll wind up with is a common architecture across all of our products, which gives us some interesting things that we can do in products that are -- that it sort of unleashes another round of innovation. <Sync id=""L238""time=""00:35:38""/>And so I don't want to say a lot about it other than we're extremely excited about it. <Sync id=""L239""time=""00:35:47""/>It's something that we've worked on quite a while to get to this point, and we're looking forward to shipping the first Mac with Apple silicon later in the year. <Sync id=""L246""time=""00:36:34""/>I think, Amit, it's a combination of a strong launch with iPhone SE and in some -- probably some pickup because of the economic stimulus that hit different countries at different points in time and probably some of the reopening that took place across the quarter, particularly in May and June, as stores started to reopen. <Sync id=""L247""time=""00:37:01""/>And so it's a combination of all of those. <Sync id=""L248""time=""00:37:04""/>And as you know, we've been having a strong cycle with the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro. <Sync id=""L249""time=""00:37:12""/>And so when you combine the -- a strong cycle plus an iPhone SE launch plus the reopening of the stores, et cetera, I think there were a lot of things that were going in the right direction there. <Sync id=""L256""time=""00:37:56""/>Yes. <Sync id=""L257""time=""00:37:56""/>Let me start with what we've seen during the June quarter. <Sync id=""L258""time=""00:38:02""/>We were -- at 38%, we were down slightly sequentially but up the same amount on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id=""L259""time=""00:38:12""/>And really, the big negative impact that we felt for several quarters now has been the strength of the U.S. dollar. <Sync id=""L260""time=""00:38:21""/>So the foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis was 90 basis points, on a year-over-year basis was 130 basis points. <Sync id=""L261""time=""00:38:31""/>So obviously, that is something to keep in mind. <Sync id=""L262""time=""00:38:35""/>And then the other aspect, I think it's always important to keep in mind, Amit, is that we sell many different products. <Sync id=""L263""time=""00:38:44""/>They have different margin profiles. <Sync id=""L264""time=""00:38:45""/>And so sometimes, a different mix can have an impact on the aggregate level of products' gross margins. <Sync id=""L265""time=""00:38:54""/>And we're very pleased to see the performance of Mac, iPad and wearables, but obviously, it's a different mix. <Sync id=""L266""time=""00:39:04""/>Going forward, the variables are always the same. <Sync id=""L267""time=""00:39:10""/>It's -- the foreign exchange will continue to play an impact. <Sync id=""L268""time=""00:39:15""/>The mix of products that we're going to be selling will have an impact as well. <Sync id=""L269""time=""00:39:22""/>The commodities market has been relatively benign, and we'll see how that plays out over time. <Sync id=""L270""time=""00:39:31""/>As you know now for several years, we've been managing gross margin, I would say, fairly well in spite of some difficult situations like the one with the strength of the dollar, and we plan to continue to make good trade-off decisions between revenue and units and margins. <Sync id=""L278""time=""00:40:35""/>Customers upgrade at different -- at a different pace, and I don't have in front of me the exact installed base data from China. <Sync id=""L279""time=""00:40:47""/>But I mean much like in other geographies, the upgrades have extended some. <Sync id=""L280""time=""00:40:52""/>It extended some during the depths, if you will, of the pandemic in China and the rest of the world and probably, to some degree, is happening still at this point. <Sync id=""L281""time=""00:41:10""/>The key things that we can do is keep innovating, deliver a product that people can't imagine going through life without and obviously keep rolling out these programs that make the front-end purchase be much less. <Sync id=""L282""time=""00:41:30""/>And this is things like the financing and the trade-in programs that you mentioned. <Sync id=""L283""time=""00:41:35""/>And I do feel like those are going quite good in a number of geographies. <Sync id=""L291""time=""00:42:10""/>The installed base is growing, and the new customer numbers that Luca went over in the aggregate are still very high in the -- close to 50% kind of range. <Sync id=""L292""time=""00:42:22""/>And so that, to me, makes the -- bodes well for the future. <Sync id=""L293""time=""00:42:28""/>There's clearly -- as we had indicated, there's some amount of work from home and remote learning that do affect the results of Mac and iPad positively. <Sync id=""L294""time=""00:42:42""/>They probably affect wearables and iPhone the other direction and -- but on Mac and iPad, these are productivity tools that people are using to stay engaged with their work or stay engaged with their school work. <Sync id=""L295""time=""00:42:59""/>And we believe we're going to have a strong back-to-school season. <Sync id=""L296""time=""00:43:05""/>Sitting here today, it certainly looks like that. <Sync id=""L302""time=""00:43:44""/>We -- usually, we've gotten away from talking about channel inventories. <Sync id=""L303""time=""00:43:48""/>But to give you a perspective, sitting here, looking at it, on iPhone, the inventory is slightly less than it was a year ago. <Sync id=""L304""time=""00:43:56""/>And that's -- I'm saying that at a quarter end point, so at the end of Q3. <Sync id=""L305""time=""00:44:03""/>And obviously, iPad and Mac are constrained, and so both of those are less than they were in the year-ago quarter. <Sync id=""L310""time=""00:44:40""/>Well, on the OpEx front, there have been obviously certain things that have been affected in terms of cost reductions. <Sync id=""L311""time=""00:44:53""/>Obviously, travel is a perfect example. <Sync id=""L312""time=""00:44:58""/>The number of meetings that we had internally, some of those costs have been reduced. <Sync id=""L313""time=""00:45:04""/>We've also invested heavily in initiatives. <Sync id=""L314""time=""00:45:10""/>For example, we're really trying to help during very difficult circumstances. <Sync id=""L315""time=""00:45:16""/>For example, we have had a program, for example, where we match our employee donations. <Sync id=""L316""time=""00:45:22""/>We made donations directly as a company around the world to many institutions and governments. <Sync id=""L317""time=""00:45:29""/>On a net basis, I would say probably, the costs have outweighed the savings both during the March and the June quarter, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. <Sync id=""L318""time=""00:45:44""/>From an employee perspective, what we said so far is that here in the United States, most -- the majority of our population will continue to work from home until the end of the year. <Sync id=""L319""time=""00:46:01""/>And then we'll see. <Sync id=""L320""time=""00:46:01""/>I mean we've taken an approach that we try to understand how the virus is evolving over time. <Sync id=""L321""time=""00:46:10""/>We've taken a very cautious approach both with our corporate facilities and with our retail stores. <Sync id=""L322""time=""00:46:16""/>I think what you've seen with retail stores is that we have reopened in a number of geographies around the world. <Sync id=""L323""time=""00:46:25""/>We've reopened here in the United States. <Sync id=""L324""time=""00:46:27""/>We've had to reclose some of the stores here in the United States as the number of cases has gone up, and we will continue to track how the virus is doing. <Sync id=""L325""time=""00:46:38""/>And hopefully, at some point, we're going to get to a point where there is a vaccine or there is a cure. <Sync id=""L326""time=""00:46:46""/>And so we'll make those decisions as we get more information. <Sync id=""L332""time=""00:47:25""/>Well, as you've seen, obviously, we've had a sequential expansion in gross margin for Services, and that was driven primarily by mix, as you said, right? <Sync id=""L333""time=""00:47:38""/>We have a very broad portfolio. <Sync id=""L334""time=""00:47:40""/>And depending on which one of the services does better, then we have an impact on Services gross margins. <Sync id=""L335""time=""00:47:49""/>We like the Services business because it's a recurring type of revenue and the margins are accretive to company margin. <Sync id=""L336""time=""00:48:02""/>We did over 67% this quarter. <Sync id=""L337""time=""00:48:07""/>But we want to offer very competitive services across the board, and the same -- I think I'm going to make the same comments that I made on products. <Sync id=""L338""time=""00:48:20""/>What matters to us is to be successful with everything that we do and provide great products and services to our customers. <Sync id=""L339""time=""00:48:26""/>So the relative success of our products and services in the marketplace will drive, to a certain extent, what our margins are. <Sync id=""L340""time=""00:48:37""/>That's -- the margins are a by-product of our success in the marketplace. <Sync id=""L347""time=""00:49:23""/>I think on the Watch, in particular, is like the iPhone, more affected by store closures because people -- some people want to try on the Watch and see what it looks like, look at different band choices and those sorts of things. <Sync id=""L348""time=""00:49:45""/>So I think as stores closed, it puts more pressure on that. <Sync id=""L349""time=""00:49:51""/>I was -- we did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter. <Sync id=""L350""time=""00:49:57""/>We were going to come out from a -- from the color that we gave you. <Sync id=""L351""time=""00:50:01""/>So we knew things would decelerate because of the closures. <Sync id=""L352""time=""00:50:04""/>So we wound up being very pleased with how we did, but the store closures definitely affect the wearables and the iPhone. <Sync id=""L367""time=""00:51:38""/>Yes, we're -- we take it one quarter at a time, and so we'll give you a color on the December quarter in October. <Sync id=""L368""time=""00:51:49""/>Generally speaking, I think we need to see a vaccine or therapeutic or both, and there's some optimism around that in that particular time frame. <Sync id=""L369""time=""00:52:03""/>And so we'll see. <Sync id=""L370""time=""00:52:04""/>I don't have any information that isn't publicly available there, but I think that would boost consumer confidence quite a bit if it began to happen. <Sync id=""L371""time=""00:52:18""/>And I think that any kind of consumer stock company would benefit from that. <Sync id=""L372""time=""00:52:24""/>And Jim, on the iPhone, I said in my remarks that we launched -- a year ago, we launched the new iPhone in late September. <Sync id=""L373""time=""00:52:35""/>So I was referring to the new product. <Sync id=""L374""time=""00:52:38""/>And I said that this year, the supply of the new product will be a few weeks later than that. <Sync id=""L377""time=""00:53:04""/>I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the penetration of Apple Card users in the iOS installed base. <Sync id=""L378""time=""00:53:11""/>And have you seen any change in the buying behavior of Apple Card users in terms of accelerating spend on more Apple products and services? <Sync id=""L379""time=""00:53:19""/>And I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L380""time=""00:53:21""/>We saw changes in consumer spending as the shutdowns occurred and as the store closures occurred. <Sync id=""L381""time=""00:53:31""/>We could see that across the Card. <Sync id=""L382""time=""00:53:35""/>It affected the categories that you would guess the most, like travel and entertainment, et cetera. <Sync id=""L383""time=""00:53:45""/>But overall, if you sort of pull the lens out on the Apple Card, we're very happy with the number of people that have the Apple Card. <Sync id=""L384""time=""00:53:57""/>We believe, based on what we've heard, that it's the fastest rollout in the history of credit cards, and so we feel very good about that. <Sync id=""L385""time=""00:54:09""/>Okay, Tim. <Sync id=""L386""time=""00:54:10""/>And as a follow-up, now that Apple has Apple silicon for Macs, would you ever consider monetizing this as a merchant silicon vendor? <Sync id=""L387""time=""00:54:20""/>Or is this going to be forever for Apple use? <Sync id=""L388""time=""00:54:26""/>Well, I don't want to make a forever comment but there are -- we're a product company and we love making the whole thing and -- because we can own the user experience in that way and with the goal of delighting the user. <Sync id=""L389""time=""00:54:42""/>And that's the reason that we're doing the Apple silicon is because we can envision some products that we can achieve with Apple silicon that we couldn't achieve otherwise. <Sync id=""L390""time=""00:54:54""/>And so that's how we look at it.","<Sync id=""L169""time=""00:26:30""/>Tim, in light of the economic adversity that you talked about in the prepared remarks, can you just walk us through how Apple's leveraging finance and trade-in programs to make technology more affordable and accessible during this period while also addressing the opportunity to recycle and reuse products and maybe also extend that to how these programs might expand over time? <Sync id=""L170""time=""00:26:56""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L175""time=""00:27:52""/>And then as a follow-up, just specifically to iPhone, the category returned to growth. <Sync id=""L176""time=""00:27:56""/>As you pointed out, the installed base is larger today. <Sync id=""L177""time=""00:28:02""/>Our math would suggest that replacement cycles, in some cases, are elongated. <Sync id=""L178""time=""00:28:07""/>And then you have the affordability element that you just discussed. <Sync id=""L179""time=""00:28:10""/>Does all of that combine to build confidence that we're entering a longer period of iPhone revenue growth after what's been 6 quarters of decline? <Sync id=""L192""time=""00:30:16""/>I have 2 of them. <Sync id=""L193""time=""00:30:20""/>First one, Tim, when you look at the Services business and in terms of your TV+ content production, have the movement restrictions impacted the content production efforts? <Sync id=""L194""time=""00:30:33""/>And along the same path, 4 years ago, your premonition on Services being a $50 billion business in 2020 came sooner than expected. <Sync id=""L195""time=""00:30:42""/>I don't know if you want to make any such forecast 4 years out on how you think Services revenue is going to be. <Sync id=""L196""time=""00:30:47""/>Then I had a follow-up for Luca. <Sync id=""L202""time=""00:31:38""/>Well, Tim, I was trying to see. <Sync id=""L203""time=""00:31:42""/>4 years ago, you made a great prediction that Services is going to be $50 billion by 2020. <Sync id=""L204""time=""00:31:48""/>I wanted to see if you have any update to the prediction 4 years down the road. <Sync id=""L210""time=""00:32:20""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L211""time=""00:32:21""/>If I could just squeeze in one for Luca. <Sync id=""L212""time=""00:32:23""/>With the strong sales in Mac given the shelter in place, do you think the back-to-school season got pulled in by a quarter? <Sync id=""L213""time=""00:32:30""/>Or do you expect the momentum to still continue? <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:33:28""/>Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:33:33""/>I know the revenue was up 2%, and I think Luca talked about record iPad. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:33:37""/>But just curious as to -- given their 5G is a bit ahead, how you're seeing the market play out. <Sync id=""L223""time=""00:33:43""/>And then I have a follow-up. <Sync id=""L234""time=""00:35:04""/>Great. <Sync id=""L235""time=""00:35:05""/>And then can you talk a little bit more about the decision to bring Mac silicon in-house and the benefits that you expect to see or you've seen from vertical integration of acquisitions like the Intel modem business? <Sync id=""L241""time=""00:36:08""/>I have one and a follow-up as well. <Sync id=""L242""time=""00:36:13""/>So first one, I guess, Tim, if I think about the strength you're seeing with iPhones right now, do you have a sense in terms of where is this trend coming from? <Sync id=""L243""time=""00:36:20""/>Is it more replacement cycles getting shorter? <Sync id=""L244""time=""00:36:22""/>Or are we just getting new customers into the iOS ecosystem? <Sync id=""L245""time=""00:36:25""/>Because clearly, these growth rates seem fairly impressive in the context of a pandemic and the upcoming refresh cycle that we have. <Sync id=""L250""time=""00:37:30""/>Perfect. <Sync id=""L251""time=""00:37:31""/>That's helpful. <Sync id=""L252""time=""00:37:32""/>And I guess, Luca, if I could just follow up with you. <Sync id=""L253""time=""00:37:33""/>I'd love to get your perspective on how do we think about the overall 38% gross margins. <Sync id=""L254""time=""00:37:39""/>What do you think are the levers to improve this as you go forward, not really September quarter but over the next 1 or 2 years? <Sync id=""L255""time=""00:37:46""/>And in that context, do you see a point where the product gross margins start to stabilize because they have been trending somewhat lower for the last couple of quarters now? <Sync id=""L272""time=""00:40:06""/>Our team in Asia, recently, we did some survey work on smartphones in China. <Sync id=""L273""time=""00:40:11""/>It showed that there's still a high proportion of the installed bases on 6, 7 and 8 devices. <Sync id=""L274""time=""00:40:17""/>I know you talked about the trade-in programs and promotions that you've been doing there. <Sync id=""L275""time=""00:40:21""/>I wonder if you can tell us whether there's anything else that you're doing to get these customers into your latest technology. <Sync id=""L276""time=""00:40:28""/>What might those customers be looking for? <Sync id=""L277""time=""00:40:29""/>And how should we think about when an upgrade cycle might come on more strongly there in China? <Sync id=""L284""time=""00:41:43""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L285""time=""00:41:43""/>Great. <Sync id=""L286""time=""00:41:43""/>And one more, if I may. <Sync id=""L287""time=""00:41:46""/>Congrats again on the strong iPad and Mac results. <Sync id=""L288""time=""00:41:48""/>That's really impressive. <Sync id=""L289""time=""00:41:50""/>I guess the obvious question is, should we ever think about how much of that might be pulled forward and what might it do to future upgrades in the next 2 years? <Sync id=""L290""time=""00:41:58""/>Anything else you can share on how you think about growth from here or whether there's a hangover period maybe after the back-to-school season or holiday season, that would be helpful. <Sync id=""L298""time=""00:43:25""/>Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit about where you think channel inventory is. <Sync id=""L299""time=""00:43:30""/>You talked about the tightness you saw exiting the June quarter for Mac and iPad. <Sync id=""L300""time=""00:43:36""/>Interested where you think inventory is across major product categories. <Sync id=""L301""time=""00:43:41""/>And then I had a follow-up for Luca. <Sync id=""L306""time=""00:44:16""/>Okay. <Sync id=""L307""time=""00:44:16""/>And then, Luca, I'm interested. <Sync id=""L308""time=""00:44:18""/>Any color you could share about the impact COVID had on OpEx in the quarter, be it work-from-home stipends, less travel, other employee support costs? <Sync id=""L309""time=""00:44:29""/>And also, how the company is thinking about the longer-term opportunity of employees working remotely maybe more permanently and any considerations on how that could influence future OpEx. <Sync id=""L328""time=""00:47:03""/>I have 2 questions as well. <Sync id=""L329""time=""00:47:04""/>I'd like to focus on the gross margin expansion within the Services line, all-time record for the quarter. <Sync id=""L330""time=""00:47:12""/>I'm just curious whether you think that will sustain. <Sync id=""L331""time=""00:47:16""/>I understand within Services, there's a pretty wide range of gross margins by business, and I'm wondering if that should continue to improve. <Sync id=""L341""time=""00:48:45""/>Got it. <Sync id=""L342""time=""00:48:45""/>I really appreciate that. <Sync id=""L343""time=""00:48:47""/>And I wanted to ask a question on the wearables segment. <Sync id=""L344""time=""00:48:51""/>It seems to me that you're categorizing the wearables business as maybe being a little bit impacted by pandemic similar to the iPhones. <Sync id=""L345""time=""00:49:01""/>And it's the first time that wearables hasn't materially upsided in at least a while in recent memory. <Sync id=""L346""time=""00:49:09""/>I guess the drivers of wearables being Watch and -- predominantly Watch and AirPods, what are your thoughts going forward on whether there's a little bit of pent-up demand perhaps that might resume as we get back to a more normalized environment? <Sync id=""L354""time=""00:50:31""/>And I have 2 questions. <Sync id=""L355""time=""00:50:32""/>I'll ask them at the same time, and it's one for Tim and one for Luca. <Sync id=""L356""time=""00:50:38""/>Tim, the coronavirus -- your company has done a fantastic job at overcoming the hurdle. <Sync id=""L357""time=""00:50:43""/>So congratulations to you. <Sync id=""L358""time=""00:50:44""/>As you look forward, say, to the Christmas holiday shopping season and given the economic challenges around the world of where is coronavirus and your product launches and things like that, can you give any commentary maybe how this Christmas, you're looking forward to see maybe some past cycles of Christmas of a line-up? <Sync id=""L359""time=""00:51:03""/>Because it just seems like it's a little bit different, but Apple is really showing a lot more strength coming into this Christmas than maybe some of the past years. <Sync id=""L360""time=""00:51:12""/>And then for Luca. <Sync id=""L361""time=""00:51:13""/>I think today, a quick comment, Luca, that -- you mentioned something about a few weeks later. <Sync id=""L362""time=""00:51:19""/>Was that for like iPhone, iPhone chips or product launches? <Sync id=""L363""time=""00:51:25""/>Or maybe expound upon that. <Sync id=""L364""time=""00:51:27""/>I know things are more difficult but I didn't quite get the commentary. <Sync id=""L365""time=""00:51:29""/>It was in your prepared comments, Luca, about a few weeks later. <Sync id=""L366""time=""00:51:34""/>Let's just do a quick little blurb. <Sync id=""L375""time=""00:52:47""/>Congratulations to you and your entire organization and teams. <Sync
