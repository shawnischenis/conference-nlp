INTC,Q1 2016,2031,5180,2080,"Thank you, Nicole, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release, CFO commentary, and the announcement of our restructuring program. If you have not received all three documents, they are available on our investor website INTC.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by the Q&A. Before we begin let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. And a brief reminder that this quarter we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures following the acquisition of Altera, now our Programmable Solutions Group. Today we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on INTC.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that out of the way, let me turn it over to Brian. Thanks, Mark. Our results in Q1 were in the lower half of the range we set in January and reflect an extra work week in the quarter. Revenue increased year-over-year driven by an expanding business portfolio that now includes the Programmable Solutions Group formerly known as Altera. Strength in our Data Center, Internet of Things, and Programmable Solutions businesses partially offset weaker than expected PC revenues in our Client business. I'll take a minute to review our Q1 results before talking about the restructuring program we're announcing today. CCG revenue grew 2% year-over-year. We saw ongoing declines in the PC TAM, particularly in China and other emerging markets, which also led to greater than anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory. Declines in the PC segment were offset by a richer core mix and a 14th workweek. The Data Center business posted another good quarter, growing 9% over last year on strong cloud and comms service provider demand, partially offset by ongoing softness in the enterprise. The Internet of Things Group grew a remarkable 22% year-over-year, due largely to the performance of the video and retail verticals. In the Memory business, strong unit growth was offset by pricing declines, leading to revenue that was 6% lower year-over-year, and in our Security business, revenue grew 12% as this team continues to tighten its focus and execution. And finally the PSG group, formerly known as Altera, got off to a great start. It delivered a revenue of $359 million, and after adjusting for $100 million in acquisition-related accounting charges, the business achieved mid-single-digit growth. And less than a quarter after the deal closed, we are shipping our first FPGA Xeon co-packaged parts to customers in sample form. These results tell the story of Intel's ongoing strategic transformation, which is progressing well and will accelerate in 2016. We are evolving from a PC company to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected and computing devices. The Data Center and Internet of Things businesses are now Intel's primary growth engines, and combined with Memory and FPGAs form and fuel a virtuous cycle of growth. Last year we achieved record revenue in the Data Center, Internet of Things, and Memory businesses. We delivered a combined $2.2 billion in revenue growth, and made up 40% of our total revenue and contributed the majority of our operating process. Today we announced a series of actions that will build on the strength of those franchises and accelerate our strategic transformation. Through this initiative we will intensify our investments in the products and technologies that fuel the growth in the Data Center, IoT, Memory, and FPGA businesses, and we expect it will result in an even more profitable Client business. These changes will reduce our global employment by about 12,000 positions by mid-2017. We will do this through site consolidation, voluntary and involuntary separations, project reevaluation, and an intensified focus on efficiency across a variety of programs. These are not changes we take lightly. We will be saying goodbye to colleagues who have played an important role in Intel's success. Yet acting now gives us flexibility. Flexibility to continue to invest in those client segments that are growing, including 2-in-1, gaming, and home gateway, among others. Even more importantly, acting now enables us to increase our investments in areas that are critical to our future success. This restructuring program will allow us to expand our investments in the Data Center, the Internet of Things, Memory, and connectivity, even as we reduce our spending run rate by roughly $1.4 billion by mid-2017. This is a comprehensive initiative. It's designed to create long-term value by accelerating the fundamental long-term change already happening at the Company today. We will emerge as a more collaborative productive team with broader reach and sharper execution, and we expect it to result in the highest revenue per employee in the company's history. Last, but certainly not least, we have one additional announcement today. I'm happy to share that Stacy Smith will be taking on a broader new role within Intel and reporting to me, leading sales, manufacturing, and operations. Stacy has been a great business partner and a world-class CFO, and I'm looking forward to continuing the partnership as he brings his leadership, his depth of knowledge, and his breadth into these critically important areas for Intel's future. We expect this transition to occur over the next few months following a formal CFO search that will assess internal and external candidates. Stacy will remain in his CFO role throughout the search and transition process. Congratulations, Stacy, and with that, let me turn the call over to you. Thank you very much, Brian, and I really appreciate the kind words. Revenue for the first quarter was $13.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year. The quarter showed year-on-year growth and was in the low end of the range of our prior outlook. Within this, we are seeing growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Security, and Programmable Solutions Groups, all of which helped offset a weak PC market. First-quarter gross margin of 62.7% was approximately a point higher than our expectations, driven by lower 14 nanometer costs. R&D and MG&A was $5.4 billion, down over $100 million from our guidance. Operating income of $3.3 billion was up 13% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.4%, about seven points lower than our prior outlook. Earnings per share of $0.54 was up 20% from a year ago. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.5 billion, a 2% increase year-over-year. This was below our expectations due to a weaker than expected PC market. Operating profit for the Client Computing Group was $1.9 billion, up 34% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower 14 nanometer unit costs on notebooks, lower overall total spending, and margin improvements in our mobile products. Data Center Group had revenue of $4 billion, delivering 9% growth on a year-over-year basis. Relative to our expectations, we saw weaker enterprise business offset by strength in the cloud segment. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year as we ramp our 14-nanometer server product. Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $651 million, with year-over-year growth of 22%. We saw strength in both the retail and video display segments of our Business. Internet of Things operating profit was $123 million, up over 40% relative to last year. Our Security business had revenue of $537 million, up 12% year-over-year. Our Memory business had revenue of $557 million, up 6% year-over-year. The segment had an operating loss of $95 million as a result of challenging pricing, increased 3D XPoint spending, and startup costs as we ramped 3D NAND in our China factory. The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $359 million. When adjusted for the approximately $100 million of deferred revenue, and compared to Altera's results for a year ago, the business achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth. Operating profit was a negative $200 million. This included over $300 million in non-cast charges for deferred revenue and inventory adjustments, plus certain acquisition related charges. Excluding these charges would result in low double-digit operating margin growth for this business. We generated $4.1 billion of cash from operations in the first quarter. We purchased $1.3 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock in the first quarter. Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $15 billion, down $10 billion from the prior quarter as a result of closing the Altera acquisition. Our total debt is approximately $25 billion, consistent with our prior commentary on the financing plan for the Altera acquisition. As we look forward to the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the mid-point of the revenue range at $13.5 billion. After adjusting for the extra work week in the first quarter, this forecast is in the low end of the average seasonal increase for the second quarter. We are forecasting the mid-point of the gross margin range to be 61%, plus or minus a couple of points. This decrease in comparison to the first quarter is driven by lower platform volumes. Turning to the full-year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits from 2015, down from the prior guidance. We are forecasting robust growth rates in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions, and Programmable Solutions Groups, which we expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing Group. We now expect the PC market to decline in the high single digits in 2016, versus our prior forecast of mid single-digit decline. Our projection of the PC market remains more cautious than third party estimates. We are forecasting the mid-point of the full-year gross margin to be 62%, a one-point increase from the prior outlook, driven by lower platform volumes. Our execution to our strategy is driving growth. We are building on our strong position in Client, and are investing for growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things markets, and disrupted differentiated memory technology. The trends over the last two years demonstrate that we are well into this transformational journey. From 2013 to 2015 the PC TAM declined 10%, yet Intel's revenue grew 5%, and our operating profit grew 14% over this horizon. But as Brian mentioned, we want to accelerate that execution. In order to do that we're going to go through a significant restructuring over the next several months. The goal is to come out of this more agile, more efficient, with more investment in our key growth initiatives, and more profitable. When completed by mid-2017, these actions will result in a 12,000 person workforce reduction, and a $1.4 billion reduction to our spending run rate. Relative to full year 2016, we are now revising our spending guidance down by over $700 million to $20.6 billion. We expect to realize over half of the total workforce reduction by the end of this year. In the second quarter of this year, we are taking a $1.2 billion restructuring charge on the GAAP P&L, with an estimate for the related actions. These actions are significant and we don't embark on this lightly, but we are confident that they will build on the strong position we have across markets, and accelerate the transformation of the Company that is already underway. I would like to end on a brief personal note by saying thank you to Brian for the upcoming new leadership opportunity. Intel changes the world with amazing technology, and I am proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited about the opportunity that's in front of us. With that let me turn it back over to Mark. All right, thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Nicole, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","Sure. I mean, if you take a look at it, so let's step back for a second and just talk about why are we doing the restructuring now, and then we can talk about some of the specifics beyond that. So we've talked about this transformation, that we're moving from a client-centric, you know Intel's been typically known as the PC company, to a company that is focused more and more on a much broader set of products, and really focused around the cloud, right? And the cloud, and all the connected devices that connect to that cloud, and the connectivity that brings those devices to the cloud. And that includes the PC, but it's much more than that. And so what this effort around the restructuring is, is to say, it's time now to try, and we've made enough progress, right? You take a look at it, 40% of our revenue, 60% of our margin comes from areas other than the PC right now. It's time to make this transition and push the Company over, all the way to that strategy and that strategic direction. So that's why we wanted to do it now. Let's talk then about the leadership changes. There's really only been three leadership changes, if we just take the last couple of quarters. We had Doug Davis, he is simply retiring. Those are personal reasons. That has nothing to do with his leadership or direction of the Company. It's IoT. We've talked about IoT as one of our growth segments. It grew 22% this quarter. It's clearly -- his performance in the group is strong. And he's staying until we find a successor, roughly the end of the year, we think, something like that. Kurt chose to leave for some outside opportunities. And the one that Stacy and I have been working for several months, actually several quarters, on what does he do next, how do we growth his both exposure to other parts of the company and also the rest of the company see his leadership style. And so what we wanted to do is, as soon as we'd made the decision, is go ahead and start a search and start looking for a CFO replacement. We wanted to be completely transparent, be very open about that and let everyone know. This is going to be an orderly transition. We are just going to start the search. Stacy is solid in the CFO seat in that meantime, but this gives him a chance to see other parts of the company. If you take a look at the group manufacturing operations, which is everything from purchasing to building construction and all, and sales, it's roughly half the Company and people. And so it's a really good opportunity to see how the real operations of the Company work. Sure, let me walk you through how we're viewing the year. And first let me just put it at the highest level, right? What we're projecting for the year is overall growth, and we think we'll see growth in the Data Center, growth in IoT, growth in Memory that's offsetting some, oh and of course we've added in Altera now into our product family, and so you take that and that's offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in the PC market. Specific to the PC market, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are now expecting that the PC market is down in the high single digits, and when we started the year we were in the mid-single digits decline. The linearity, so first you have to understand, the first half is impacted by the fact that as our customers view of the market came down, and if you recall we had a more cautious view of the market than they did when we started the year. They were bringing down inventory levels, and that impacted us in Q1 and I think you'll see the same impact as we forecast a roughly seasonal second quarter, that we'll continue to see those customers burning off inventory. We think that doesn't repeat in the back half, so it's a little bit of a tailwind. I'd also say, you want to be careful of, we guided to mid-single digits. That's a range. If you are mathematically trying to drive to a specific number there, you may be driving more backend than what we're really anticipating. So just a caution there that that's a range, it's meant to be directional of how we see the Business. All of that said, I just want to say I think Brian and I are very comfortable with the back end and what's implied in our guide, based on everything that we know. So it is absolutely a situation where we are structuring to be able to allow ourselves to invest at a faster rate in those growth areas. If you take a look at it, 2016 to 2015, in the areas of Memory, with our NAND technology, IoT, Data Center, even before this action, we were investing more in 2016 than in 2015 in those areas. This will allow us to, even with the cuts, even with the dollar figures that Stacy has read out on the savings, it's allowing us to invest even more in those segments. And I always want to make sure, it's not just about cutting costs necessarily in the client area. You know, we think that we can become more focused. There are areas of the client space that are growing. 2-in-1s are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. Gaming PCs are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. Set-top boxes are growing, and we are gaining share in the set-top box space. So we're doing very well in segments that are growing in the client space and the PC space. And we are going to continue to double down and focus on those. So it's really a narrowing down and allowing us as a result also to invest more in those growth areas. That's really what we're doing here with this restructuring. And Blayne, just to make sure, if you look at the CFO commentary, just to make sure the financial answer is clear there, the $1.4 billion in run rate savings is a net number. So I just want to be clear on that. That's what we expect to achieve, and that is encompassing the fact, like Brian said, that we'll be increasing investments in a lot of different areas. Correct. Sure. Absolutely on schedule for hitting our committed $800 million, and just like last year we'll shoot to do better than that. Mobile is absolutely continuing to grow for us as a segment, and we're continuing to increase our profitability. If you look underneath the numbers here, you'll see that the profitability within the mobile space continues to improve for us, this year over last year. Yes, you can really see it, Blayne, in the CCG operating profit. That's up over 30%, which is on roughly flat revenues, revenues were up a little bit. And when you parse out the big contributions there, there's some ASP good news, but the really big chunks are the improvement in the margin on our mobile products, and decreases in investments that we talked to you about in the past that were all included in that mobile profitability. So you can, you'll see this play out in the CCG profitability over the course of this year, and you can see it in Q1. Sure. You did a great job explaining exactly why we believe that the Data Center will continue in double-digit growth this year. And if you take a look at the numbers that Stacy has talked about, they incorporate double-digit growth, and for exactly those reasons. We believe we have great products that we are introducing, with the Broadwell lineup. We've started shipping our first Xeon+FPGA samples to customers, which was part of our additionally gaining more footprint and more performance in certain segments of the Data Center. We shipping the Omni-Path Fabric now. Later this year we'll have Silicon Photonics. We've got 3D XPoint starting to be sampled and we'll start to ramp later this year. So we're very confident on our Data Center road map, and we are still absolutely forecasting double-digit growth in that space. Sure, so let me start and then we can just talk about, remember the majority of our Memory space is built into SSDs that are going into the Data Center, so you call those, really those higher-end performance class systems. What we're saying, if you take a look at units, units grew quite nicely year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter for the Memory Group. You're right, we are seeing aggressive pricing in this space. The Memory segment, the NAND segment especially, tends to go in these cycles where there's overcapacity in the industry, and aggressive pricing, and then it shifts back to more normal pricing, and then tight pricing, which is always very positive. So this is just a normal cycle. We think we've done a very good job of structuring the business that we ride through these with a high degree of confidence. If I look forward, we believe the 3D NAND technology that we're just beginning to ramp in our factories today, and we're building out the Dalian factory for later this year startup, gives us a real cost advantage in this space and will allow us to even be more profitable in even these kinds of environments. So we're still confident that this business will continue to grow. We'll ride through this capacity situation within the industry, and our 3D NAND technology will position us very nicely as we move out of this and start up our Dalian factory in China. And the operating margin, Harlan, when you're looking at that, part of it is the competitive pricing environment that Brian is talking about, but there's a big piece of that that is associated with the investments that we're making it 3D Xpoint, and the startup costs associated with the factory in China. And it just points to, yes, it's cyclically a tough time in what we consider a very good business, and we're investing in technology that we think gives us a very strong position as we go forward. Yes, so like we said when we started the quarter, that extra week was that week between Christmas and New Year's. When you look at where that 14th week fell, it's a relatively light, but it certainly had some impact, so I don't want to say none. But it's a little hard to figure it out on any given business. It certainly had some impact on DCG though. In terms of the pricing, it's pretty simple in that it was the growth rate that we saw in the networking segment. So what you would see, with a constant mix we would have seen ASP up in the Data Center, but the networking segment grew 50% year-on-year, which is exactly consistent with our strategy, and so what you see there is strong unit growth offset by a little bit of a mix down. You said own inventory in the channel - Yes, so I would point to two things relative to the overall, what we saw from our customers. One is, yes, we had a 14th week that's going to make our compares different from IDC and Gartner, for sure. But then the second thing is, when you look at the results of our customer base? They would see a weaker quarter, and I think that's because they were catching up to our view of the market and bringing inventory levels down. So we were impacted by two things, I'll put it like that. We were impacted by a TAM that wasn't terribly strong, and the fact that our customers were bringing their inventory levels down some. No. What's going on there is that when you look at the two items that really dominated our CapEx this year, it's 10 nanometer capacity, so it's getting that first production capability in place, and it's the ramp of the memory factory in China. And those are both back end loaded, so that causes the linearity to be off a little bit. I'd say the same answer. When you look at those two items, the majority of what we're spending the CapEx on, 10 nanometer and Memory? Neither one of those is impacted by the restructuring, so we haven't let our foot off the gas one bit on those two things. Sure. A bit of a complex question, so let me try and give you a lot of data that I hope will answer various parts of that question. So first the simple answer. If you take a look at our forecast, we continue to forecast ASPs increasing through this year. So that's absolutely built into our forecast, and we've modeled in things like you described: the weaker enterprise computing, and the difference between the pricing segments. And I always remind people that, let's just start at the very top as, when you take a look at the Data Center, it's not one product. It's a family of products that really spanned from Xeon 5s that sell for several thousand dollars, to the networking processors that are a few hundred dollars at times. But within each one of those families - so whether you have networking or cloud or hyperscale or enterprise computing - our ASPs are increasing, and that's mostly due to bringing in better products, people buying up the ladder in product, and resulting in a higher ASP on average for any one of those segments. So you will see slight shifts in the overall Data Center ASP. We have a boomer quarter like this, like Stacy talked about. Networking is a little bit higher or something like that. But if you take a look inside any one of those segments, ASPs are increasing, and our forecast for the overall segment for the year is an increasing ASP. And it's driven by people buying up the stock, and that's because we're bringing more performance for a better price to those customers. Yes, certainly. We are equally focused on efficiencies in the factory space. There's a little bit baked into the 2016 gross margin. I think you'll see a bit more of it kick in in 2017. And just realize the labor cost in the factories is a relatively small component. The real opportunity for us is some of the other things around capital efficiency, and how fast we convert over processes, and things like that, and that takes a little while to play through. Thanks, C.J. Yes, so John, you nailed it in terms of what's going on with operating profit in Q1. It's just the early cost of the ramp of the 14-nanometer server product. That's what's causing that to behave a little differently from revenue. And back to Brian's point, I would say no, there's nothing in the mix that per se would cause me to have a different view of the overall profit potential of this business. So taking networking as the example, it does have a lower ASP than the Xeon product line does. It also has a very different cost structure than the Xeon product line does. So it doesn't cause us to being a different space from overall operating profit percent. Sure, so again John, that's a bit of a two-sided question. So let me start with the back half, and then we'll move into the first half. First is, no, I'm not worried that the PC will shrink to a point where the scale won't get large enough to fund either the factories or the other innovation. In fact we talked about the restructuring actually makes us more profitable in the PC. That's allowing us to invest even more in those growth areas. Remember also those growth areas are growing, and so they are replacing some of the volume in the factories as they grow. Now let's talk about the PC, you asked how do we take a look at the PC long-term, and how do we make sure we're making the right investments, which to me that's the key, right? That's what we really tried to do with this restructuring, is take a look at the areas that are growing, that we believe we can bring innovation to, that will make a difference to the end-user. You are going to see more investments in 2-in-1s. You're going to see more investments in thin and light devices. You're going to see us push even harder on high-end gaming systems, which are growing at a very fast rate, and they tend to buy up the stack to the very, very top. And then we're continuing to gain share in segments like set-top boxes, which are becoming more and more PC-like with our capabilities, if you think about it from a hardware standpoint. So there are absolutely segments we'll continue to invest and continue to innovate in. There's some very innovative systems in design right now, that bring new functionality and new thinness and lightness to the market for the second half of this year. And we'll do that. What we're going to do is make sure we're doing this as most efficiently, and not doing it spread out across all PCs and all form factors. And that's what we've really tried to do with this effort right now. Thanks, John. You were a bit faint. I think you asked on the restructuring how much of that is cash versus non cash, and how does that play out over the year? Now you're loud and clear, thanks. I would say the restructuring charge is a mix of cash and non-cash, but it's probably, it's more heavily weighted towards cash costs, and it will be relatively front-end loaded on the year, but some of it will extend over the course of the year, and some of it frankly will extend into the first half of next year. Yes, and if you look at the CFO commentary, we actually gave you desktop and notebook. What you'll see is that notebook was pretty flat from an ASP standpoint year-on-year. Desktop was up 6%, so that is one of the [adverse] to profitability. And then the big difference is what happened in phones and tablets. On a year-on-year basis, I think I termed it in the CFO commentary, up significantly as we weaned ourselves out of some of those counter revenue programs that we talked to you about. So that actually had a fairly significant impact on the overall ASP for CCG. You're welcome. Sure, good question, Vivek. First I'll just tell you that, having been raised by Andy Grove, always paranoid about the competition, always driving, and you know that we live or die by the performance of our product. We believe that if you take a look at our road maps, we have strong competitive leadership that should allow us to continue to have the position in the market that we currently have. I think also you have to take a look at some of our strategy that is becoming much much broader than just the CPU. What we're trying to do is really provide top of rack to bottom of rack solutions, that bring -- that work together and bring performance across the whole rack. And that starts with rack scale architecture itself, which is a very unique architecture that will allow people to build racks in a much more denser and lower cost way, through silicon photonics within rack communications. Then we go to 3D Xpoint. And then you have our whole CPU architecture, from networking, storage, up through server. So we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide that whole rack viewpoint, and have everything work together and come together to bring, really, performance that is just unbelievable. And that's what's key to really keeping our position, is to understand the whole rack from top to bottom. And that really is our strategy when you take a look at it. In the other areas, like you said, networking and storage and the telco area? Those are areas that we're gaining share, and as they move to software-defined infrastructure, and basically virtualized infrastructure, it plays right into the Intel architecture, and really what we do best which is general purpose computing. And that same architecture from top of rack to bottom of rack plays out in those areas as well, like in the telco area. So we believe our strategy absolutely will maintain our position in that. But we're always paranoid and we're always realizing we get there by performance of those products. Let me give you some elements of it, and then I would expect we'll have a much more in-depth conversation on that at the next investor meeting. But I'll give you some insight into how Brian and I are thinking of this. First and foremost, we believe there's growth potential here. So from a top line overall company standpoint, we think that there's significant opportunity to grow. And I think we've executed well in terms of growing over the last couple few years, even as PC TAM declined, and that's very consistent with our strategy as invest in the Data Center, in Memory, and IoT, and things like 5G, where we think there's opportunity, and focus our investments in the Client that we've talked about. In terms of the overall model, the financial model for the Company, I've given you this range of 55% to 65% gross margin as being -- most of the data points landing between those goal posts. If you look at it over the last five years, we've very consistently been in the very high end of that gross margin range, so it's more like between 60 and 65%. Last year we were 63%. This year we believe we are at 62%, so that continues. I don't see anything on the horizon that changes that in the near term. And then with these actions that we're taking, when we get to full realization, and I want to stress, we do believe that this will give us an opportunity to reinvest in the business and actually accelerate growth, but if you just look at the cost side of it, it's 2 to 3 points of spending as a percent of revenue when we get to mid-2017, and full realization. That takes our spending as a percent of revenue, even just based on your estimate of 2016 revenue, it's 2 to 3 points, it takes us back down into the low 30s from a spending as percent of revenue. You can do the math from there and see what we think we can achieve next year in terms of overall operating range. You're welcome. No, I'm not going to give that level of granularity of forecasting by quarter and 2017, but I'll say and I want to be clear that the $1.4 billion is all OpEx. That's an OpEx savings number that we think we get to by mid-2017. So just to recap the financial data that we provided you, we get to that level by mid-2017, that's $1.4 billion in savings, and that is a net number, so that's including some reinvestment that we plan to make. We think that's 12,000 positions that get eliminated, which is a very difficult thing for us to go through, but that's what's in these numbers. We think we achieve half of those employment reductions by the end of this year. And overall for 2016 we've brought down our OpEx by $700 million, that is again to get this restructuring program. And we've added in a line that you'll see on the GAAP P&L of $1.2 billion in restructuring charges to achieve that. So beyond that I'm not going to go into any more granular data. I think that should be plenty. And now we want to go have the conversation with the employees and help them understand what this program means. Sure, so let's dissect those. From memory, one, we believe that if you take a look at our typical margins, they're better than cell phone margins on typical quarters. But also it's integral to the Data Center, so it really actually is this virtual cycle that, especially as we move to 3D NAND and then to 3D Xpoint, as we've talked about 3D Xpoint and how that really re-architects how memory and storage is played out in the server rack and in the data center overall, it's a chance to really very uniquely shift that whole infrastructure. So we believe that's actually critical to our strategy in the Data Center. And we'll bring out a product with good margins. Now let's talk about IoT. If you take a look at it, first, it's growing quite well and if you take a look at the Data Center, I mean the IoT, right now, it grew 22% this quarter, and it has PC-like margins, so this is not cell phone chips. They don't tend to be cell phone chips. If you take a look at the segments we're really going after, which are things like automotive, or what I'll call autonomous vehicles, industrial and retail, they tend to be systems that have a fair amount of compute at the edge. They tend to have machine learning capabilities. These are systems and they tend to have a high degree of cons, more and more will move into 5G. But that link also between those products in IoT and 5G, and the 5G infrastructure, we believe also plays into the Data Center, and the whole Data Center strategy, and will be critical that you can provide end-to-end solutions. So, if you're somebody out trying to build whatever that autonomous vehicle is, you need to be able to provide the 5G back end, but also the 5G out on the device, whether it's a car or a drone or a robot, or whatever it is out there autonomously moving about. And Chris, on the margin point, I'd take you back to points that Brian and I have made at the investor meeting and other places, which is, remember, and IoT's the perfect example of this, those businesses lever IP that we create broadly for the company. And so our cost of entry in something like IoT actually is relatively low, because we have the Atom core, we have the graphics, we're investing in the connectivity, we're investing in the wireless weigh in for other businesses. And that's where we really get leverage in this model, and that's one of the reasons that the IoT profit margins have been as high as they have been. Thanks, Chris, and Operator, I think we have time for two more questions. Sure. I would tell you that I'd reiterate what I said, which is it's a mid-teen type of growth rate. You've got to take a look at this over the long haul. The IoT space is similar to the embedded space of old to some extent, and to the FPGA space, where you have, especially where we're trying to go, where you're trying to go into products that require that higher level of compute, the machine learning, and those capabilities. You have a design time, a design in time to win the design, and then you have a ramp for that product. And so those tend to take a little while. Autonomous driving vehicles are good example. If you're out winning designs today, you're winning 2018, 2019 car designs. Those are what are being won today. So as you bring your products to market that's what you are winning. So I'm still believing that over the long-term this will be a mid-teens growth. It will have for the most part PC-like margins. And we've tried to pick the segments that play to our strengths, and also use the connectivity that we believe we're uniquely qualified to bring. Sure. For the reported quarter, the big driver of the tax rate was the discrete item associated with one of the divestitures that we drove out of our Security business, and we got a one-time tax benefit associated with that. Just going back to the strategy, you can see the performance of the Security business both in terms of the revenue growth and their profit growth. I think the team there is doing a really good job of focusing in on a few key areas where we think we have competitive advantage, and then driving them hard. And we've divested a few smaller business and we happened to get a tax benefit on one of them. As we look at the year, so part of it is what happened in Q1. And then the other part is we would expect to have a higher proportion of our profit in lower tax jurisdictions as we work our way through the year. It will bring down the tax rate a little bit. Yes, I'm sure that as we go through this and we finish the project evaluation, there will be some products that we'll exit from, those as they're defined. Murthy, we've brought into the company is doing a complete review of all of our products. And he's going to report back to me in the near future and give me a proposal for what those look like. So we don't have any that are set out today, but at the end I'm sure there is going to be a few that are part of that. No, it does not have any effect on our technology cadence. It has not touched that at all. Stacy talked about even our CapEx and how the CapEx that we're spending this year, which has not moved, is mostly for either the 3D NAND ramp or 10 nanometers. As far as Moore's Law, we are always constantly striving to get back to two years. We've given you a timing that's for 10 nanometers; that's more like 2 1/2 years. We haven't talked about 7 nanometers. Partly it's still in definition and alignment, so we're not sure, but I can truly tell you we're constantly working to get back to two years. And I've tried to lay out that if you look at the history of Moore's Law, there have been anywhere from 18 months to three years in the length of cycles over the time. More importantly what I always remind people is the leadership you have over the competition, which is always what's important, right? All of these are getting harder, and they get hard for everybody. And so you want to make sure also that your leadership gap, what you're able to do relative to the competition, remains constant, as well. Both of those are as important as the other. Thanks, David, and thank you all for joining us today. Nicole, please go ahead and wrap up the call.","Hello. Thanks for letting me ask a question. First and foremost, B.K., if you can go into a little bit more about what led to the restructuring announcement, not only the one today, but there's been significant changes in the senior management over the last three months. So if you could just talk us through some of what's changed strategically in the Company that's led to such a large amount of turnover so recently? Okay, thanks for all those details. My follow-up would be the full-year guidance of mid single-digit growth. When I put that together with the high single-digit decline now that you have in the PC business, I'm having a little hard time seeing how, if you take the seasonality of PCs out of the equation, in large part, what would be the lever that would get you there in the back half of the year, considering that a ramp well into the $15 billion range in revenue seems to be a prerequisite. Are there some moving parts you could describe to us that get you comfortable with that number? Great, thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I really just wanted to follow up on the restructuring. Is it more an effort to make the client more profitable, or are you really trying to drive revenue and redefining maybe more employees than you're letting go? Thanks. And then I know mobile is within Client, but I was wondering if that's a segment that you expect to contribute to growth this year, and if you can just talk about your confidence in reaching the cost savings for the year? Great, thanks. Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I'm trying to see if you can be just a bit more specific on your full-year view. Does the team anticipate double-digits growth in DCG? If I look at it fundamentally, cloud and hyperscale CapEx looks to be up this year. There seems to be a big upgrade cycle in networking with the move to 25 gigabit ethernet. You are rolling out 14 nanometer Broadwell. Can you just be a bit more specific on expectations for DCG growth? Great, thanks for the insights there. And then on the Memory Solutions Group, I mean that's a business that grew 20% last year. I think it was up year-over-year every single quarter last year. Obviously it was down in Q1. You mentioned aggressive price declines. Can you just talk about some of the trends that you're seeing there? Are the sharp declines more focused on capacity or performance optimized SSDs? And then you also mentioned your view on a strong growth outlook for the full-year. So what drives the acceleration from the Q1 decline? Understand. Thank you. Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one on DCG in the quarter, so up 9% year-over-year, but that was with the extra week. Can you tell us what it might have been year-over-year without the extra week, and why did pricing fall again this quarter? Got it, thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to touch on channel inventory. So, you had your notebook and desktop volumes down low single digits year-over-year. I think it's fair to say that PC builds in the industry were down quite a bit more than that. And yet you suggest that you drained out with the channel drain on inventory. What happened with your own inventory in the channel, and how do you see that changing for rest of the year? The stuff you're shipping into the channel. Because it seems like your performance year-over-year is quite a bit better than what the industry was. I mean maybe you did some share gains, maybe it's the extra week, although you just said the extra week didn't amount for very much. So can you explain the differential between your year-over-year unit shipment performance in PCs and what the market seems to be doing? Thanks, Stacy. Yes, thanks very much. Stacy, you're below your run rate on CapEx in Q1, and I know you reiterated for the year, but  curious if you're giving yourself flexibility in case the second half doesn't prove out to be as strong as you are anticipating. Okay, thanks. And then just staying on the theme of CapEx, with the restructuring you guys are talking about site consolidation, and I'm wondering if longer-term there will be an impact to the capital expenditures required to support the business, and by extension, free cash flow. Okay, thank you. Good afternoon, thank you for taking my question. I just have a follow-up on DCG. Thank you for the commentary around the pricing around network. But curious how we should think about the mix shift through, as we go through 2016, and here curious in terms of presumably slowing enterprise and uptick in hyperscale, and what that means to ASPs, and then as you layer in ongoing growth in networking, how we should think about platform versus ASPs moving through the year? That's very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, you outlined the cost savings, but it doesn't appear as though there's really anything on the COGS side. So curious if you see a cost savings on that front, as well. Very helpful, thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting me ask a question. My first one, I wanted to get a little more into profitability within the Data Center Group. You know revenue was down about $309 million sequentially. Operating profit was down $411 million sequentially. I know there's lots of moving parts, you have the extra week of OpEx that might not been fully covered by revenue. And Stacy, you talked about in your opening comments, the 14-nanometer ramp starting to hit there. But with this new narrative of declining ASPs because of mix, I'm wondering if you could tell me how we should be thinking about operating profits in the business going forward? I think it was about 44% in the March quarter, down pretty significantly in the December quarter. Is this change in mix also having an impact on operating profits? That's helpful. And maybe for my follow-up to Brian, you guys gave us your view for the PC market this year. I'm curious, in lieu of the restructuring, how you're thinking about the PC market longer-term. And specifically there's lots going on in the market that you probably can't control, but there's always been this view at Intel that the best use of cash is to invest in the business and to innovate, and innovation drives growth. How do you balance that innovation desire with the realities of the PC market? And how do you think about the structural unit growth of PCs going forward, and do we run a risk at some point that PCs just don't provide the scale that you've talked about in the past, to invest in other businesses like DCG and IoT? Helpful. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Could you just talk about, from the restructuring cost perspective, how much of that is going to be cash versus non cash, and would all the cash outlays happen in the back half of this year? Yes. Perfect, and for the follow-up, ASPs on the client server up 19%. Just talk about how much of that was potentially CPU improvements on notebook and desktop pricing versus the lower mobility that may have had a better part to play there? Perfect, thank you. Thank you for taking my question. Brian, on the Data Center Group there's a lot of headlines from IBM, from the different arms, several lenders, and even from some of your cloud customers like Google who want to try new architectures, and I understand there is no new-term impact, but longer-term, how do you assess the competitive landscape, and especially how do you think it plays out on the compute market, where you are very large incumbent versus the comms market where you are not the incumbent? Got it, thanks for those details. As a follow-up, I know you probably have answered different pieces of this question, but perhaps Stacy, you could help us quantify what Intel started operating margins are this year, or maybe even longer term. Because when I look at a lot of fabless semiconductor companies, they can get towards 20%, 25% operating margins, and when I look at a Foundry, a DSMC, it's able to get close to 40% operating margin. So given those bookends, where should Intel be after all these restructuring actions are taken? Thank you very much. Thanks, just a quick follow-up on the last question on restructuring. So should we assume that total expenses will drop roughly $150 million a quarter from 4Q 2016 to the second quarter of 2017? And then if you could break that out between how much of the savings would be on COGS versus OpEx? That's a very fair response. And then for my follow-up, in terms of the growth opportunities that you are pushing for, IoT, DCG, etcetera, if you look at the margin profile of them, memory and basically cell phone processors, it's substantially below your current margins. My question is why would you want to pursue two markets like that where the margin profile is so much lower than yours? Got it, thanks. Hi, thank you very much. I actually wanted to continue on IoT, Brian. A couple years ago, you had laid out a 20% tailored target for this, then I think a year later you had brought it down to mid-teens, and yes, it grew very strong this quarter, but last full-year it was a 7% grower. So the question is, what's the right way to think about the growth profile for this Business, and what happened in the past? Was it a one year off event, or help us understand the drivers, and why it should re-accelerate, and why the first quarter is not an anomaly? And then a quick follow-up. Okay, thank you, and then a quick follow up. Stacy, what explains such a big swing in the tax rate for the quarter, for the reported quarter, and then for the rest of the year? Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thanks very much. A clarification of the commentary you gave earlier on your restructuring. Will there be any product lines or types of products that you'll be pulling out of in the future, with all the cuts that you're making? Okay. And related to that, does the restructuring affect your longer-term expectations for technology transitions, and in particular are you still hoping to get back to a two-year tick-tock cadence? Great, thanks very much. PRELIMINARY TRANSCRIPT: ""Preliminary Transcript"" indicates that the Transcript has been published in near real-time by an experienced professional transcriber.

INTC,Q4 2015,1834,4172,1702,"Thank you, Sabrina, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's fourth-quarter 2015 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents they're available on our investor website, INTC.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, during this call, we'll be using non-GAAP financial measures and references. GAAP financial reconciliations are available in our earnings material, which was posted on our website, INTC.com, in advance of this call. The forecast that Stacy speaks to today will be on a non-GAAP basis. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. Thanks, Mark. Our results for the fourth quarter were consistent with expectations, and marked a strong finish to the year. Taken as a whole, 2015 demonstrated the benefits of our strategy, which is designed to capitalize on the growing need for the infrastructure powering the smart and connected world. That strategy is also resulting in the evolution of our business model, to focus on three key areas of growth: The data center, the Internet of Things, and memory. Our results reflect that evolution. Revenue for the year was nearly flat, despite a significant decline in PC demand. 2015 was also a year of revenue records and important milestones, and I'd like to take a minute to review some of them with you. Even though the Client Computing Group ended the full year down 8%, we were excited to see that we were able to grow sequentially in the second and third and fourth quarters. As of November, 14-nanometer products made up more than 50% of the client computing volume. And for the year, high end Core i7 micro processors and our K SKUs for gaming both set all-time volume records, leading to a rich product mix. In our security business, we've refocused the organization on end point technology, where we enjoy a solid leadership position, and we've driven material efficiencies, as we fully integrated the McAfee organization into Intel. The results of these changes have been dramatic. On a constant currency basis, security revenue rose 6% for the year, while the organization's tighter focus drove a remarkable 44% improvement in operating income. The IoT group grew revenue 7% in 2015 to $2.3 billion, an all-time record. As the retail, transportation and video segments all saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth. In our NAND solutions group, we introduced a revolutionary new class of memory called 3D XPoint, the industry's first new memory technology in more than two decades. 3D XPoint is a great example of our growth strategy at work, using our technology expertise to innovate and expand into profitably adjacent markets. We think it's a game-changing technology, moving forward. Our confidence in the technology led us to announce in the fourth quarter that we were upgrading our Dalian, China fab to manufacture both 3D NAND and 3D XPoint, with production beginning later this year. For the full year, our memory business grew more than 20% to $2.6 billion, another all-time record. At the same time, the Data Center Group grew 11% over last year to an all-time record of $16 billion in revenue. Macro weakness weighed on enterprise demand and resulted in slower growth than we expected at the beginning of the year. However, DCG's overall performance highlighted the underlying trends driving data center demand, as cloud and communication service providers' revenue both grew more than 20% for the year. Within the cloud segment, 40% of our volume was custom SKUs as we left the year, demonstrating the ongoing value of working directly with the customers to tailor solutions to their needs. Finally, just after our fiscal year ended, we closed our acquisition of Altera. We're thrilled to welcome the talented Altera team to Intel. Combined, our two companies will deliver powerful synergies based on Intel's process technology leadership, and the integration of Altera's FPGAs. Wrapping up, our results over the last year leave me increasingly confident in our strategy. While our outlook for the first quarter reflects some caution about overall demand, particularly in China, we continue to expect solid growth in the business in 2016. Because it provides tremendous return to our shareholders, we will continue to drive innovation and differentiation in our core PC business. This business provides a foundation of IP, and a source of cash flow, but it's not the sole driver of our growth. Our future as a Company will increasingly be a product of the virtuous cycle of opportunities in the data center, memory and IoT market segments. In fact, you can see the impact of that virtuous cycle in our 2015 results. DCG, IoTG and memory delivered nearly 40% of Intel's revenue, and more than 60% of Intel's operating margin in 2015. Additionally, these three adjacent markets delivered $2.2 billion in profitable revenue growth in 2015 alone, and as we look ahead to 2016, we'll continue to build on that strategy. Now with that, let me turn it over to Stacy. Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year, with record revenue at $14.9 billion. We had record revenues in the data center and Internet of Things businesses. Gross margin of 64% was up 2 points to outlook, net income was $3.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year, and earnings per share was $0.74, flat over the same horizon. I would like to provide context behind our full-year 2015 financials, as it provides insight into how we are executing to our strategy. Growth in the data center, memory and Internet of Things businesses partially offset a weaker than expected macroeconomic environment, and a weak PC client market. Overall, revenue for the year was $55.4 billion, which was down 1% from the prior year. The Client Computing Group achieved $32 billion in revenue, and was down 8% for the year. Within the Client Computing Group, we achieved almost $1 billion in mobile profitability improvements over the course of the year, exceeding our goal. The data center business, at about $16 billion in revenue, grew 11%. The memory business, at over $2.5 billion in revenue, grew over 20%. And the Internet of Things business, at about $2.3 billion, grew 7%. Gross margin for 2015 was approximately 63%, down about a point from 2014. Higher unit costs as we ramp 14-nanometer were offset by an increase in ASPs, driven by strong results in the data center business, and a rich mix in the client computing business. Operating profit for the year was $14 billion, down 9% year on year. Earnings per share for the year was $2.33, up 1% from the prior year. In 2015, the business continued to generate significant cash, with $19 billion of cash from operations. We purchased $7.3 billion in capital assets. We paid $4.6 billion in dividends, and repurchased about $3 billion of stock. Total cash balance was $25.3 billion, up over $11 billion year-over-year. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, and inclusive of our other longer-term investments is approximately $6.6 billion. We issued about $9.5 billion of new long-term debt to finance our acquisition of Altera, and in November we announced an $0.08 dividend increase to $1.04 per share on an annual basis, effective in the first quarter of 2016. The acquisition of Altera was completed in early FY16, which means that the 2016 guidance includes the expected results for the FPGA business. As I talk to our guidance for 2016, it is important to note that we have excluded non-cash and one-time acquisition-related charges for Altera. The CFO commentary pre-released before this call and available on INTC.com includes the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. For the first quarter of 2016, the midpoint of the revenue range is expected to be $14.1 billion. This forecast, which includes an extra work week, and the newly-acquired FPGA business, is on the low end of the average seasonal range. This outlook represents a soft start to the year as we remain cautious on the level of economic growth, particularly in China. We continue to believe the worldwide PC supply chain is healthy, with appropriate levels of inventory. Gross margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 62%, and spending is expected to be $5.5 billion. Turning to the full year 2016, we are expecting revenue growth in the mid to high single digits, relative to 2015. This outlook is higher than our previous guidance provided at the November investor meeting. This higher range is driven by the addition of the FPGA business, partially offset by some caution as a result of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Gross margin for the year is expected to be 63%, and spending is expected at $21.3 billion. The capital spending forecast for 2016 is $9.5 billion, up from 2015. As the economic useful life of our manufacturing equipment lengthens, we are extending the depreciable life of equipment in our factories from four to five years. This change in depreciable life drives approximately $1.5 billion in lower depreciation expense for the year. Inclusive of this change, we are forecasting depreciation expense to be $6.5 billion this year, down $1.3 billion from 2015. Our results demonstrate that we are transforming the Company. We are pivoting towards the cloud, with a diversified portfolio of businesses. Client is still the largest segment, but the other businesses now make up about 40% of our total revenue, and 2015 marked the first year where these businesses made up the majority of our operating profit. The data center business is growing fast, and is now a $16 billion business. That growth is being driven by growth rates in cloud computing that were over 40% year on year. Our memory business grew over 20% year-over-year, and is well positioned to disrupt the industry with the launch of 3D XPoint technology. The Internet of Things business grew in 2015, and is expected to contribute more growth this year. And with the Altera acquisition, we expect to broaden our product portfolio in the data center and Internet of Things businesses, and enable even more innovation. Most importantly, we are pivoting towards the cloud, diversifying our client business, and building a strong foundation for long-term growth for the Company. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. All right. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question, and just one follow-up, if you have one. Sabrina, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","Sure. I'll start, Joe. This is Brian. It was the same type of trend we saw throughout 2015, with clients buying up the stack, and you saw it in our record revenue in Core i7 and K SKUs, which are really our top-end SKUs. The forecast for 2016 has us relatively flat in this space, so we don't know if it will continue. But right now, we forecast it at flat, the ASPs, for 2016. And just to add, Joe, so -- there was a client comment. In total, we see ASPs up a little bit in 2016. You can see it in the gross margin recon. It's not -- as Brian said, we're maintaining the client ASP, but we are expecting that server becomes a larger percentage of the mix. So we've got some mix impact, based on what's going on in server. No, the depreciation change was not included in my forecast that I provided back in November. We were in the middle of the analysis. What prompted it was -- we did an in-depth analysis based on the cadence of moving from one process technology node to the next. We talked about that at the beginning of 2015, and the third wave of products. And we completed our long-range planning in the fourth quarter, and that's what triggered the change in the depreciation cadence. I'll also say -- so, just to then tie this out for you, in November I was forecasting a 62% gross margin for the year. I'm now projecting a 63% gross margin for the year. And the difference there is this change in depreciation. So, you can kind of see it in that gross margin recon. Sure, Vivek. It's the same type of trends we saw in 2015: emerging markets slower than the mature markets; US, western Europe looking okay; China and the rest of Asia slow. It was both consumer and enterprise. I'd say it's a little bit heavier on the client side, so the PC side, than the data center side. But we're seeing some of it on the data center side as well. Those are the two big drivers, and it's all the same geography. Sure, and first, let me -- if you'll bear with me, let me just take a second to detangle the 2016 numbers, because with the extra work week, the Altera acquisition, which includes some one-time costs, and the change in depreciation, it becomes a little hard to, I think, get to the bottom of what's actually happening operationally in the Business. If you recall, in the investor meeting in November, Brian and I talked about the fact that we were looking to reduce spending as a percent of revenue by 0.5 points. If you just take all of the adjustments out -- so, you don't adjust for the change in depreciation, you don't adjust for Altera, or anything like that -- we're getting that 0.5 points. When we add all of that in, we're getting a bit more than the 0.5 points improvement from 2015 to 2016, in terms of our projections. So, we feel we're delivering what we committed to; and when you put some of these adjustments on top of it, we'll deliver a little bit more. In terms of the opportunities there, we articulated it, and I'll let Brian come in over the top, but we articulated at the investor meeting, we're still committed to drive spending as a percent of revenue down. We're in the midst of a transformation right now, and so we are going through a period where we're weeding and feeding our portfolio. We're making some dis-investments. But very importantly, we're investing in areas that we think are critical for the long-term growth and health of the Company, and where we get lots of return, i.e., the data center, the Internet of Things, our process technology leadership, the memory business. So, we knew going into this year it would be a time of elevated investment. We're delivering what we committed, but there's more to come in future years. Thanks, Vivek. Sure, CJ. This is Brian. So let me just give you a broad picture of Altera, and where we're at. So, as you said, we just closed. We have just gotten through the employee integration, everybody's got a badge; if you go by, the signs out front say Intel now. Really excited; we're starting to dig in to some of the product road maps. The good news is, we'd been working separate companies on the first of the server chips, which is a multi-chip package, so, FPGA and our Xeon in the same package. That will actually start sampling to select customers in the first quarter of this year, and it will continue to select in limited quantities, it will continue to sample throughout this year, with production in 2017. Our road map will then -- we're still working on our road map beyond that of when do we integrate the full IP into our silicon, so make a monolithic die. We're actually spending an equal amount of time on that same kind of a road map, an MCP, or a multi-chip package, followed by a monolithic die in the IoT space. We feel pretty good about the progress, and we're already, in the first quarter, going to be sampling to the leading-edge cloud guys that you can think about. It's all logic, for the most part, and it's not as much a macro, or adjusting the capacity or anything like that; it's just the ins and outs. As we went from the investor meeting into the actual firm forecast for 2016, the teams just sharpened down all their numbers, and went through it in more detail. I don't think there's anything more to it than that. I'll let Stacy comment if there's -- if he wants to give you any other light on this one. No. Yes, there's a couple things I want to talk about on the Data Center. First, when you compare Q4 to Q4, you're looking at a comparative where Q4 2014 was one of our strongest quarters, as long as I can remember, with very strong -- greater than 20% growth for the quarter. So, that quarter was a little bit of unique, so the quarter-to-quarter comparative is a bit tough. If you take a look at how the second half, which is really Q3 and Q4 looked similar, enterprise actually stabilized from the first half. So, enterprise was weak in the first half, and tended to -- got a little bit more stable in the second half. And what we saw was a normal -- the cloud guys tend to slow down in the fourth quarter, because that's when a lot of the cloud -- they don't want to be upsetting the cloud infrastructure while the holiday seasons are on and people are buying things. And then we continued to see strong growth and strong share gain in the networking and telco side. We're absolutely -- we continue to look out -- and again, we're very careful to not look at this on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We're looking at the long view, and we're very confident that, yes, we'll continue into this double-digit growth in the Data Center. It will continue to be fueled by the cloud in the first side, and then secondly by our growth in telco and networking, as our share grows there. Remember, we entered the year at less than 10% share in that space, and there's a lot of space there for us to grow in the networking and Telco space. Let me just add one thing to the premise of your question. We weren't surprised by where we ended up in the Data Center. If you recall back in November, we talked about Data Center growth rate for the year being in the low-double digits. That's exactly where we came in. Based on what Brian was just talking about, in terms of the strength of Q4 2014, we were expecting this to be a tough compare, and that we'd have growth rates in the single digits. As you said, we kind of went roughly a year or so without a desktop enterprise upgrade, and especially when you combine coming back now with a refresh -- that refresh being Skylake -- the combination of Skylake's great performance and great graphics. We're past the Windows 10 launch, which is another positive in this space. We're hearing very good response, as far as people's interest, the form factors you're seeing. You're seeing all-in-ones; you're seeing classic desktop platforms; you're seeing great graphics; you're seeing OLED displays. Overall, it's just another segment where we think the best computing devices really the computing industry has ever built are going to be showcased. The excitement's there, and we've just got to get past the macroeconomics of enterprises saying -- we're going to do the upgrades. It's not an impact at all, Stacy. This is -- whether we're at 2 years or 2.5 or 3 wasn't going to dramatically shift that life expectancy like this. This is more about the amount of reuse, and the efficiency and speed at which we can do the conversion. And so, both of those numbers have improved. Now, the cycle -- clearly it doesn't hurt to have, from this perspective, the longer node cycle. But independent of that, this is a change that was fundamental to the shift in reuse and rate at which we're able to move the tool from being able to run, say, 14 nanometers to 10 nanometers. And I would also just add -- that's exactly right. The reuse is something that's been shifting over time, and it gives us a lot of economic benefit. I'll give you the accounting answer here, too, which is: If we got to 7 nanometer or 5 nanometer and there was something that caused us to look at the depreciable life, the economic usefulness of the equipment, we would change it. But we're certainly not expecting anything like that. But this is -- we go through this analysis every year. The only thing I would add to finish is: Within the manufacturing side, one of our objectives is to continue to improve on those vectors that I talked about, the reuse and speed at which we're able to do these transitions. And so, we'll be constantly trying to get this to be a longer and longer number, if possible, independent of the nodes, because it just shows that we're becoming more efficient. Maybe I didn't hear you right. Just want to clarify: The extra work week is in Q1 of 2016, not Q4 of 2015. A little earlier than that. So, the background on this is, we go through this every 5 to 7 years. Because we're on a work-week calendar, over a 5- to 7-year period, we get out of sync with the actual calendar. And then we add in a workweek, in order to get back on sync. It's a little -- it's easy actually to quantify the spending associated with that extra workweek, because we've got lights on, and factories running, and we're paying people. The revenue associated with it is a little harder to calculate. When you look at where the week actually falls, it's that week between Christmas and New Year's. Our fiscal year ended, I think, the day after Christmas, and so it's that week between Christmas and New Year's that tends to be a billings week that's dramatically lower than any other week we see during the year. So, some revenue impact; hard to quantify it. The way I'd look at it though, when you look at our guide, and you take out Altera, and you take into account any impact for the extra work week, what you'd see is that the guide for the first quarter is at the low end of what we normally see from a Q4 to a Q1, is how I'd think of it. And then you add Altera back on top of that, and you get to the revenue number that we provided. And just to be totally transparent, the revenue number for Altera in Q1 is on the order of $400 million. So, you can do the math from there. Thanks, Stacy. So, that's actually a great question, John. So, for Q4, the decline, or the decrease in ASP was mostly driven by the much higher growth rate in the networking, as you mentioned, and the fact that the percentage of Atom in networking tends to be a bit higher. If you look at networking as a whole, the ASPs in networking tend to be lower than, say, cloud or enterprise. However, if you look at Q4's networking ASP -- so, if you took out just that ASP, and you compared that ASP relative to prior quarters, it was actually up as an average. So, it has a lower average selling price, but that average selling price is increasing as more people buy -- and as NFV and SDN take off, more people tend to buy up to core, because they're really searching for that performance. We do hope and expect this trend to continue into 2016, as we gain share in networking. The relative strength -- so, then if you take a look at the cloud space and the enterprise space, we expect those to continue on the trends you've seen over the last few years. We don't expect any major shifts there, but we have very strategic plans to continue to grow in the networking, storage, and especially around the telco and networking space, as SDN and NFV really take hold. And you will see a slightly lower ASP from there, but we expect the ASP to continue to increase in that space as we bring more functionality. Does that answer your question? Sure. And a great question. I know there's a lot of moving parts here. Let me just focus in on the depreciation change for a second, and I actually try to be very transparent. In the CFO commentary that was released, you'll see some of this written out, so you can always refer back to it. But the change in depreciation, you're right, in total, is about $1.5 billion. But only about half of that is flowing through COGS, and impacting gross margin in 2016. And that's where you get to the 1 point shift. That really is the primary difference. There's a few other moving parts, but nothing that's material. That's the thing that changed from 62% gross margin forecast that we had in November to 63% gross margin forecast that we have today. The rest of the change in depreciation -- about a quarter of it will flow through OpEx, because remember, all of the spending we do for research and development facilities actually flows through our research and development line, so you see a little bit of a benefit there. And then you have some of it that goes into inventory, and then ships out over time. I'd articulate that what we're seeing -- we have a cautious stance as we start the year. There's a couple of things that feed into that. Units were a little weaker for us in the client segment in Q4. As we worked our way through the Christmas selling season, what we saw is the sell-through all the way to the end customer was a little less than we thought. We made up for that with a rich mix, so that's why we ended up with a pretty good result. But a little -- we're watching that carefully. And then, our team on the ground in China has gotten fairly cautious about what's going on in China right now. And as you know, that's the largest PC market. So, we're just a little cautious on the growth rates there. In terms of from here, I think Brian said it well. We're expecting -- this is the environment as we work our way through 2016. So, against the backdrop of a somewhat weak macroeconomic environment, we expect the year to play out normally from here. I'm not going to speak -- they have not -- they didn't release results for 2015, and so I'm really not able to talk about their results for 2015. I can tell you from our perspective, we didn't see anything that was surprising, in terms of what we've seen about their business levels. We actually expect some revenue growth as we go from 2015 to 2016. I'll give you in total what we expect for Altera. It's a little north of $1.6 billion in terms of revenue. Its gross margin, that as John was saying, is a little higher than the corporate average, so it gives us a slight mix. But because it's a relatively small business against the backdrop of Intel, it's not a big shift in our gross margin. And then we're expecting spending that's at a run rate of a couple hundred million dollars a quarter. In addition to all of that, there will be a bunch of one-time acquisition deal-related costs. There's amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. You'll see all those in the GAAP number. I've excluded them from the non-GAAP numbers I just gave you. No, I think that's actually part of our DNA, is we're pretty rigorous about trying to weed and feed where we invest, and where we disinvest. As you referred to in the investor meeting, I showed an up and down arrow chart, and the magnitude of those shifts was on the order of $1 billion for some of the big movers, as we added investments in some areas, and subtracted investments in others. I'll also say there's a point at which we expect that we get more and more leverage in businesses like the Data Center, as well. I think there's lots of opportunities for us to bring down spending as a percent of revenue, as we go forward. Add anything to that? No. Go ahead. Sure. So, we believe that 2015 ended with, I'd just call it, very healthy inventories. In fact, one of the things we saw was a slight decrease in inventory levels as we exited the fourth quarter. And if you take a look at what we had originally projected, and what would have been more an industry norm, would have been a slight increase in inventories. We expect those healthy inventory levels to extend through 2016; there's no sign that anybody's adding inventory, or not moving off a cautious position on inventory. And that's what's been built into our forecast, as well. To the question on internal inventory levels, I'd just say we ended Q4 with a little more inventory than I was expecting, and a little higher than I'd like. Two drivers there: We saw, as I said, a little bit weaker units was made up for us in rich mix. But a little bit weaker units and we saw yields get better on 14-nanometer, and the combination of that left me with a little more inventory leaving Q4 than I'd like. You'll see it -- if you look on a dollar basis, it will go up in Q1 as a result of Altera. So, Altera will cause the inventory levels to go up some. But when you look at it from a business standpoint, I think we'll work through the inventory we have. And when we get into the back half of the year, we'll bring inventory levels down. Sure. I'll take the accounting question, and then I'll have Brian give you his insight and philosophy on the whole integration. On the reportable segments -- so actually, I do plan to give you full visibility into Altera. It's a relatively small business for us. It doesn't hit the SEC reporting requirement. So, it doesn't come across that threshold. But we just feel strongly that, based on transparency, and the size of the acquisition, we want to give you transparency. So, you will see that in our financials going forward. I'll let Brian answer the integration question. From an integration standpoint, I think what you see -- what you've seen we've done with McAfee is we've integrated it into Intel Security, and you saw the great results that we showed in the fourth quarter. Those are somewhat an example of what happens as you integrate, and you really get the focus on the business on a much higher level. Same thing for Altera; we plan to fully integrate it. It's going to look like a business group, no different than, say, CCG, that does PCs and modems, phones, or DCG that does data center. It's called PSG, Programmable Solutions Group. It reports directly to me, and it will be fully integrated. The sales force at the beginning, because the sales tends to be a bit more technical, and a bit more like a field sales engineering-type role, we're keeping it separate. But that's something we're going to continue to evaluate. But the organization, the engineering -- already in the first two weeks, we've had -- really for me, I'm really pleased with the level of integration and help that we've done to get products and road maps focused and integrated into our internal systems. So, you should expect it to be fully integrated. Thanks, Blayne. Operator, I think we have time for two more questions. Let's see, I think we've got Broadwell Xeon; it's going to launch in the first half here of 2016. So, that will be the first of the 14-nanometer, or the next 14-nanometer in 2016 is that E5 on Broadwell. The rest of them, we haven't put any other dates out there yet -- Skylake SKUs and so forth. There will be some pretty significant costs. It's in the gross margin recon, associated with the startup of the factory in China. And we'll be in production in the back half of the year, but we're just ramping production. I think if you were just looking at a six-month time period, you'd say it's negative, and you can see it in the gross margin. It's a slight negative on the gross margin. It doesn't change the fact that we make these investments, and then we get this, what I would say, tremendous long-term benefit out of making that investment. So, that doesn't -- I don't want you to take from that, that we're somehow less bullish on the transformational capabilities of what the team has managed to pull off at 3D XPoint, because we're actually quite bullish on that. Yes. We said that -- this is Brian, by the way, not Stacy -- that 10-nanometers would be closer to that 2.5 years than the 2 years; that we would continue to strive to get back on 2 years. Some of that was how, as we [still define] 7-nanometers, what the complexity of the technology looks like, whether EUV is ready or not. Absolutely, we're pushing to get back on that two-year cadence. I would just add, please don't take the accounting of the depreciable life to be somehow a signal that we're letting our foot off the gas on process technology cadence and process technology leadership. That's the heartbeat of the Company, and we're driving it; we're driving it hard. The accounting just is looking at how long that equipment is economically viable in our factories, and it's pretty clearly five years, as we go forward. It's absolutely still the target. That has not changed one bit. It's a little early in the year to talk about progress. We have -- I'd tell you that we have a large percentage of that $800 million already, I'll call it, planned out. In other words, we have projects. We know what we need to do, introduce products, align which SKUs are coming, and move products onto that. So, I'd say a large percentage of that is well planned through the year, but it's throughout the year. So, I can't tell you -- I've already got $200 million of it, or something like that, not here in the second, third week of the year. 7360 -- it's out. It's sampling. The customers are going through their validations now at the systems, where they are building up systems and out testing them on networks, and so forth. And as far as the launches of those systems and the announcements, those are always up to our customers, and we don't make sure that we're the ones announcing that. And then, what we've told you is that what's even as important is that we're on a yearly cadence now of our modem technology, and we're very confident on that as well, for the next set of modems that comes out after the 7360. Thanks, Tim. All right. Thank you all for joining us today. Sabrina, you can please go ahead and wrap up the call.","Great. Thank you so much. The client average selling prices went up again for the second quarter. Is that the same trend you saw in Q3, a stronger high end, and what's your assumption for the ASP trajectory going forward? Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, the depreciation change -- was that something you had known about when you talked about the full-year guidance at the Analyst Day, and what was it that prompted you to make that change now? Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for taking my question. First, Brian, you mentioned that there is some uncertainty near term in the broader environment. I was hoping you could provide us some more color around that, if possible, by your different segments, and perhaps by geography? I see. And for my follow-up, maybe for Stacy -- Stacy, can you talk about the leverage in the model? Because if I take your full-year sales growth number, OpEx is roughly about 35%-ish or so of sales, which is in line with what you had given at analyst day. I'm wondering what steps can you take to drive more leverage in the model? As an IDM, shouldn't the goal be to get to at least 30%-plus operating margins? What steps can you take this year to help drive more leverage in the model? Thank you. Thank you. Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess now with the Altera deal closed, curious if you could provide an update on your server chip road map and strategy, as we look into 2016 and beyond? Very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, you provided a $10 billion CapEx budget, and now it looks like it's about $500 million lower at the midpoint. Curious what has changed there. Is that principally capacity on the logic side, as opposed to memory, given what we're seeing in the macro environment? Thank you. Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the Data Center business, it decelerated as the team has expected, but 5% of your growth in Q4 was a bit more deceleration than what we were anticipating. So, I guess two questions: Was it all enterprise that drove the weakness, and do you expect to get back to a double-digits growth trajectory in the March quarter, and is the team still confident about driving mid-teens growth for DCG in 2016? Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then for my follow-up, the team is going to be launching its sixth generation vCore product line for enterprise, desktop, PCs, I think next week. There also hasn't been a refresh of desktop for two years. I guess the question is: What are you hearing from your corporate and enterprise customers as to the potential uptake of these new platforms, relative to the very muted enterprise demand profile that we had last year? Thank you. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to go to the equipment life extension. So, I know you were hopeful that eventually you'd be able to get your node migration trajectory back from three years to two, but this sounds like a fairly permanent change in terms of extending your equivalent lifetime. What should we take from this action, in terms of how you view the potential improvement ability of your node migration trajectory going forward? Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at the extra week that's in Q4. How much of your guidance is actually coming from that extra week? Is it the full -- I guess it would be 7.5% or whatever it is -- or is it less because that week is happening at the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016? How should we think about how that may influence normal seasonality in Q2? Yes, but I think it's like December 28 through January 4 or something. So, how does that -- Got it. Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Brian, the first question I have is on the DCG business. This quarter, the December quarter, you saw a modest drop in ASPs, both sequentially and year over year, which is somewhat of an anomaly for that business. And I guess I understand the mix shift, as cloud grows faster than enterprise. I'm curious: Do you think this was a one-quarter anomaly? Is this something we should expect more of, as networking grows faster in 2016? And within the individual segments, are you still seeing customers buy up the stack? Yes, it does, very helpful. Stacy, as my follow-on, you raised the full-year gross margin by about 100 basis points, but if I do the math, a $1.5 billion decrease in depreciation on a $60 billion revenue stream is more than 100 basis points. In addition, the Altera gross margin was higher than your core. And so I guess I'm trying to understand, what are the offsets? Is 10-nanometer cost coming in higher than expected? If you could help us understand the progression of 10-nanometer cost throughout the year, that would be helpful. Thank you. Hey, thanks, guys. Just another question on the weakness you're seeing: Can you just maybe go into some detail on when it started? Have you seen any stability? Is this just CPUs? And in your full-year forecast, are you implying that we get back to normal seasonality in Q2 through Q4? Okay. Thanks. And then, as far as the Altera revenue, I think you said $400 million. I think that's down like somewhere in the mid-teens or something like that, sequentially. Why the conservative forecast? And then, do you have any forecast for the year for the Altera business? Great. Thanks. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Stacy, one question on the OpEx side, back to that leverage question: You had a very useful slide at the analyst meeting about how you had dis-invested in some areas, and increased investments in another. I guess my net question is: Given that ability to do a substitution in the past, is there any limitation on that going forward? Or if you were going to keep spending more on some of the growth initiatives, is that actually going to be all incremental to the level we have now? I guess my final -- I guess as my follow-up question is just -- any more color you can provide on the channel inventory? You mentioned that the unit demand was a little weaker than you had expected. How's the channel looking right now, and what expectations should we have for your internal inventory, looking into this year? Thanks. Great. Thank you. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Stacy, the roughly $400 million of Altera -- I don't expect you to report it going forward, but just curious, how does that fit into your reportable buckets? Can you just level set us for the first quarter out? And then secondly, could you just talk about how you're integrating or not integrating Altera? I feel like I've heard both. It sounds like you wanted to keep the sales force separate, but just curious, where does that report under, and how much integration are you going to do? Thanks very much. What might we expect in the way of new 14-nanometer data center processor families in 2016? Okay. Great. And my follow-up: With start-up and other charges, do you expect memory output in China in 2016 will be a positive or negative contribution to EPS, and should we expect a positive contribution in 2017 from the China fab? Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot. I just had a question again on the depreciation change. I know, Stacy, you talked about it being due to reuse, but I guess relative to just the fundamental cadence of the migrations, your intent has been to get back on a normal, Moore's Law cadence. I just want to make sure that's still the case. Right. Okay. Got it. And then just last question: So, on the mobile group, at the Investor Day you talked about another $800 million improvement this year in the losses. Is this still the target, and maybe talk about the progress there, and whether we could see any momentum for smartphone this year with 7360? Thanks a lot.

INTC,Q2 2016,1965,4496,1997,"Thank you, and welcome everyone to Intel's second-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment we will hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. Thanks, Mark. Our top-line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook. And profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations. Year-over-year growth this quarter was 3% overall as we transformed Intel into a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices. We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation, as evidenced by results in the data center, IoT and programmable solutions business this quarter. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through these results and their implications. I will start with the Client Computing Group, where we saw a 3% decline in revenue year over year this quarter while operating margin was up 19%. These results were a little better than we expected, as the PC supply chain reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate while the two-in-one and enthusiast product lines continued to grow. We also started shipping our seventh generation core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and our latest LTE modem, known as 7360. Next the Data Center, where revenue grew 5% year over year. Cloud service providers grew 9%, comm service providers grew 10%, and enterprise was down 1%. We achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year. In the data center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack. Average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment, from Adam and Xeon D SOCs at the low end up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end. We continued to gain share in network infrastructure throughout the entire segment, as Intel architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the network to SDN, NFE, and 5G. The significant share gains at the low end of the network infrastructure segment resulted in an overall 1% decline in data center CPU average selling prices. Progress in the data center extended beyond our CPU product lines. Our latest Xeon Phi accelerator, formerly known as Knights Landing, continued to ramp after shipping the first limited production units in December of last year. Xeon Phi revenue grew eight times in the first six months of this year versus all of 2015, gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments. Omni-Path, our high performance computing fabric, was launched earlier this year and has already achieved 30% market segment share of the 100-gig fabric market. In June's top 500 supercomputing list, Omni-Path was deployed in half of the new 100-gig systems, pointing to the performance that this technology brings to the market. This quarter we also shipped our first silicon Photonics products for revenue, the industry's only fully integrated solution. We expect DCG's adjacent product lines, including Omni-Path, Silicon Photonics and ethernet, to collectively grow more than 20% for the full year, and this quarter make up 12% of DCG's revenue. The Internet of Things business was up 2% over last year, coming in below our expectations. We saw growth in the industrial and video verticals offset by an inventory burn after a very strong first quarter. We continue to see tremendous potential in this business. A great example was demonstrated earlier this month when we announced our autonomous driving collaboration with BMW and Mobileye, marking a significant step for the auto industry as we work together to establish an industry standard, open platform for autonomous driving. In addition we're bringing Indian computing technology to power the next generation of BMW's highly autonomous and fully autonomous products, of the door locks to the data center. Our Memory business was down 20% over last year, and fell short of our expectations as a result of a more competitive pricing environment. While we acknowledge the cyclical and competitive nature of this business, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects as a result of the new technologies we're bringing to this market. 568 in Dalion, China started its initial 3-D NAND wafers late in the second quarter, but ahead of schedule. We also remain on track to ship 3-D Cross Point SSDs, branded Optane, by the end of the year, and look forward to delivering this exciting new breakthrough in memory to the industry. The Programmable Solutions Group, formerly known as Altera, delivered great results. PSG grew 12% over Altera's results last year, a strength in [calms], infrastructure and the channel. PSG is on track to ship 14-nanometers, Stratex 10 samples this year. I'm very pleased with both the integration of this business and their strong execution. Our security business was up 10% as a restructuring the team completed last year, and their focused execution continues to deliver results. And finally, our restructuring initiative that we began last quarter is solidly on track. This program is changing where and how we invest in everything from research and development to sales and marketing. In April we announced some important changes to our roadmaps in areas like SOCs and perceptual computing. These changes are accelerating our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and the billions of smart, connected computing devices while increasing the profitability in our Client business. In total we expect this initiative will drive in a net run rate OpEx savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017. Looking ahead, I am very excited about the growing momentum heading into the second half of the year. While we remain cautious about the PC segment and continue to expect a decline in the high single digits of this year, we're expecting our businesses outside of CCG to collectively deliver double digit growth in the third quarter. We are seeing clear signs that our strategy is working, laying a solid foundation for growth built on the Data Center and the Internet of Things business, reinforced by the combination of Memory and FPGA, and bound together by connectivity. With that, let me turn it over to Stacy. Thanks, Brian. In the second quarter we met our financial commitments and made good progress towards our restructuring goals. Our forecast reflects growing momentum as we enter the back half of 2016. Revenue for the second quarter was $13.5 billion, in line with expectations and up 3% year over year. Gross margin for the quarter of 62% was approximately 1 point higher than our expectations, primarily driven by lower platform unit costs. Spending on R&D and MG&A was $5.2 billion, in line with our expectations. We're on track to the restructuring announcement last earnings call, with a reduction of about 6,000 employees in the second quarter. Operating income of $3.2 billion was down 2% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Earnings per share of $0.59 was down $0.03 from a year ago. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.3 billion, down 3% year over year. Client Computing Group operating profit was $1.9 billion, up 19% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower overall spending and margin improvements in our mobile products and higher ASPs in the PC segment. The worldwide PC supply chain inventory levels came down a bit in the second quarter, and as we enter the second half they are at healthy levels. Data Center revenue was $4 billion, up 5% year over year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, down 4% year over year, primarily driven by increased costs as we ramp 14-nanometer data center products. As we enter the second half we expect the enterprise segment of the business to stabilize and the cloud segment growth rate to accelerate. In addition, we expect increasing ASPs as we ramp our Broadwell-based server products. Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $572 million, with year over year growth of 2%. Our security business had revenue of $537 million, up 10% year over year. Our Memory business had revenue of $554 million, down 20% year over year. This segment had an operating loss of $224 million as a result of continued pricing pressures, higher startup costs as we ramp 3-D NAND in our China factory, and an increased 3-D Cross Point spending. The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $465 million, up 12% year over year when compared to Altera's results from a year ago. Operating profit was negative $62 million. This includes about $160 million in non-cash charges for inventory adjustments. Excluding these charges would result in about $100 million in positive operating profit. Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $17.7 billion, up $2.6 billion from the first quarter. Our total debt is $28.6 billion. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer term investments, is negative $5.7 billion. We're projecting to improve this net cash balance over the second half of the year. We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enable us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. This is demonstrated in our Q2 results, as we generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter, purchased $2.3 billion in capital assets and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock. In the second quarter we also paid $1.2 billion in dividends. And as of yesterday's close of market our dividend yield was about 3%. As we look forward to the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.9 billion. This forecast is at the high end of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range to be 62%. Turning to the full year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digits. We continue to expect the overall PC market to be down in the high single digits, and we expect to achieve low double digit growth in our Data Center business. Gross margin for the full year 2016 is expected to be 62%, consistent with our prior outlook. You can see our strategy playing out in our first-half results and our expectations for the second half. We expect above seasonal growth in the back half of the year led by strong growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things and Memory businesses. And for the year we expect that growth in those business will offset the PC market decline, and with the addition of the Programmable Solutions Group, will result in mid-single digit revenue growth. Additionally, we're executing to our restructuring program, which allows us to increase investments in strategically important areas, generate financial returns for our owners, and build the foundation for future financial growth. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Okay. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Caller Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","Sure. I will start and then Stacy can add. This is Brian, Chris. I think it's really a mix of a couple of things. One, we saw in the second quarter, and we project out into the second half, a bit of stabilization of the enterprise side of the market. Enterprise side was down only about 1%, which is a bit more stable than it has been. Second thing is we are ramping our Broadwell E server in the second half of the year. So we expect strong demand. And we typically see an ASP uplift as people buy up in the stock with the new server systems coming out. And we have customers signals that just indicate that there is a second-half seasonal buying patterns kicking in a bit as well. Those three things are the second-half keys. If you take a look at a broader view of this, just overall our view of the Data Center and really the cloud continues to be that the cloud is going to continue to expand. It's going to be driven by the many, many machines that connect to the cloud that drive orders of magnitudes more data than what the average human creates today, and that's getting to the cloud. So there's kind of the short versus the longer-term point of view. Perfect. Yes. So I'm not going to talk specifically about the 7360, because our policy is let our customers announce any design wins that they want to announce when they want to announce them. In terms of the overall impact on financials, when I look at the second half, you will note that we have an above seasonal growth rate in there. The biggest driver of that is what Brian just talked about in the Data Center. So that's kind of the biggest driver. We were kind of below the average annual growth rate in the first half. We expect to be above that low double digits in the back half driven by the three things he talked about that. But in particularly the cloud buying patterns that we've identified with some of those large customers. And then behind that we see an improvement in revenue in Memory and an improvement in revenue in IoT. So those are the big drivers as we go into the back half. John, how about if I start on just the view of the PC, especially into the third quarter, and then Stacy can get into the where is the above seasonal numbers coming from? I think if you look at the second half, we already said that Q2 ended up being a little bit better than what we had anticipated. And we had built the year at the high single digits. And if you take a look at Q2, it ended up coming at kind of the mid-single digit decline. We've tried to be relatively cautious as we look out into the rest of this year and built the year and the forecast around that high single digit number set for decline of the PC. We are carrying momentum out of Q2. So there's still data that needs to be collected on how it looks. But right now we have maintained our cautious view of the high single digits. So just to translate that into seasonality against the backdrop of what Brian just said, which is high single digit decline in the PC business, we're expecting that to play out more or less seasonally, John. We tend to do a little bit better than that because of mix in ASP, but from a unit standpoint should be fairly seasonal. And then the driver is what I just talked about. The Data Center growth rate as we move into the back half should be significantly higher than what we saw in the first half based on stabilization in enterprise, what we see with the cloud customers. And then some ASP uplift as we ramp Broadwell server -- 14-nanometer Broadwell servers into the product mix. There's a short-term and a long-term component to this. In the short term, as I think about the second half, in rough math I would expect a consistent loss in the second half to what we saw in the first half. I think startup costs will be slightly higher. We will see the first production cost play through on 3-D Cross Point, which as you know from watching us over the year, those first production costs tend to be fairly high in any factory when you're starting it up. Offset by the underlying existing NAND business, I think gets a bit better as we go into the back half. So that's the short-term answer. To your longer-term question, and I will turn this over to Brian to talk about the technology, but I think the combination of 3-D NAND and the cost structure we're going to achieve, and then the disruptive nature of 4-D Cross Point, we should have a very good value proposition and a very good overall profit position for the business. John, I would just echo was Stacy said. We're just now starting to ramp our 3-D NAND. So as we go through this back half of this year and into next year, it's really starting to ramp up. We think large cost advantages and good performance position there. And as we said, 3-D Cross Point SSDs start to ship at the end of this year. 3-D Cross Point and DIMMs next year. And so these investments that we are making this year, which we have talked about, are really playing forward those two technologies. So I'm still very bullish on the long-term prospects. The units and the gigabytes continue to grow. Our cost structure gets better and better as we go through the back half and into next year. And then 3-D Cross Point, as we've said, will really, in our minds, change the whole memory storage architecture. So overall relative to expectations we had at the beginning of the year, let's say, it's primarily enterprise driven. And then there's what we commonly use as lumpiness quarter-on-quarter. So to how you asked the question, we actually weren't surprised by the Q2 results. In fact, they came in right in line, actually just a hair above what our internal forecast was. We have, I think, pretty good insight into the large cloud customers. And so we had some good insight into the buying patterns as those customers went from Q1 to Q2. And now as we look at the back half we see several purchasing cycles kicking in for some of the large guys. So we expect that the cloud piece will accelerate as we get into the back half. Yes. Those are two different things. I'll just start with the easy one, days sales outstanding. I'm not seeing anything unusual there. That's just the amount of net billings at the end of the quarter. The average day paid and all of that still looks really healthy. So I'm not seeing anything unusual there. On the inventory side, as I talked to you last quarter, we ended Q1 higher than where I wanted to be. Our yields got better in Q1. Frankly, they got a lot better in Q2 as well. And we under-shipped a little bit in Q1 relative to the units that we were expecting. So we took some actions in the second quarter to start bringing inventory levels down. What you see inside of inventory, it was kind of flattish, right in line with what we expected Q1 to Q2. It was a remixing. So you see some more expensive server parts and some skylight parts going up, and then you see some of the older generation CPUs going down. And as we get into the back half we would expect inventory to click down, and be down pretty meaningfully by the time we get to Q4. Thanks, Joe. Sure. If you take a look at it, there is 3-ish, maybe 4-ish, major segments of the PC that did better and continue to do better than the rest of the segment and overall. Laptops, mobile PCs continue to do better. They did better in the second quarter. Two-in-one devices specifically do -- are doing very well and continue to grow in double digits. And then as you said, we often call it enthusiast gaming. You see our case SKUs in there. And then you saw us also announced the X SKU, which is our new 10-core system that has been selling much, much better than even we anticipated. And so yes, gaming and enthusiast continues to grow at a double digit rate. Let me take the revenue question and I will let Brian take the, what we see in the verticals part. It was not one vertical. If you just look at it, I think our customers got out a little ahead of their skis in the first quarter. If you remember, I think we had a 21% or 22% year-on-year growth rate in Q1. There was a little more inventory out there than we anticipated, and that took some of the -- that was a bit of a headwind as we started Q2. To your question on the back half, we do expect to reacceleration. I had said at the investor meeting that we expect double digit growth in excess of what we had achieved last year. We still expect that. We had a strong Q1, inventory burn in Q2, we expected a strong Q3 and Q4. From a which verticals, the verticals that have been the strongest growing for us, especially in recent, has been industrial and in the security video type applications. Those have been the two real growth. We have a lot of, I'll call it longer-term growth vectors. Retail's a longer-term growth factor. And then you saw, as we mentioned in the call, automotive ADAS section, like the announcement with BMW, some other programs in that space as well. Yes. I would say -- I'd characterize enterprise in the back half consistent with what we saw in Q2. If it stabilizes at that rate, that gives us the ability to grow to the levels that we are projecting. And then for the cloud, yes, you are right. It's what I said earlier. We actually forecasted a pause in purchasing based on what we knew of the customer -- the big cloud players' ordering patterns. And based on the signals we are seeing from them, we do expect a reacceleration in the back half to something more consistent with what we were seeing through the last couple of years. It's what we saw in Q2. We saw it down slightly. And again, it's just what we see of the big enterprise customers' signals to us in terms of what they want to purchase. Thanks, Stacy. Sorry crossover from what to what, Ross? I will be honest. I haven't looked at the data from that lens. But what I'd say, let me just take you back to the answer that I gave, I think it was to Joe's question earlier. That if you look to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year, the enterprise is a bit weaker than we thought overall for the year. And I think cloud will be in line with what we thought. So my guess is that still true. Which quarter it happens maybe a jump ball, but my guess is this still true. But I would like the opportunity to actually go look at the data and I can give you a crisper answer next time we talk. Sure. So first let me start with your question on Data Center. There's a lot in there. So I do expect an operating margin improvement in the Data Center as we work through this year. I think we were kind of around mid-40%s in the second quarter, and historical ranges been closer to 50%, as I expected, that ticks up some as we move into the back half. The big driver there is costs. So the early production on the Broadwell server is fairly expensive. Costs come down as we get into the back half. And as you said, we do expect some ASP uplift in the back half. Overall for the Company what we're seeing, I'll use Q3 as the anchor point, we are seeing some good news in Q3 associated with higher volumes. And then the big offset there is we are seeing 10-nanometer startup costs going up pretty significantly in the back half. So that may be the piece that you are missing in the equation in Q3. That continues into Q4, by the way. We see a little bit more startup costs. If you do your algebra, you are probably coming up with a gross margin for Q4 that's about 62%. So think of that as some good things happen, but we have again an increase in startup costs and we have some of the Dalion costs with the first production of 3-D Cross Point that also kick in a bit more in Q4. You're welcome. Overall we continue to see inventory levels as being very healthy. I think that the PC -- the worldwide PC supply chain has moved towards a stance of being fairly lean and fairly cautious, and we see that continuing. You would typically see an inventory burn in the second quarter. It was little bit less of an inventory burn then what we expected. I think it goes back to Brian's comments that he made at the beginning of the call that from their perspective the PC market was a little better in Q2. So I think they probably just brought down inventory levels a little bit less. I would say for the Company you would expect to see the seasonality, a revenue seasonality for us that's in the high single digits as we go from Q2 to Q3. Our guide is a little higher than that for the reasons that we've been talking about. PC market is probably in line with that, maybe just an inch higher in terms of the overall PC channel. Sure. So we'll talk about that in more depth at the investor meeting, but I'll give you some off-the-cuff comments here. First, to just put it in perspective, the operating margin percent decline that we saw in Q2 had nothing to do with the new products, or the new products weren't driving it. It was the 14-nanometer cost of Broadwell server. And we get in the back half we're going to see an ASP impact associated with that because we think that the performance of that product brings -- enables customers to get a better value proposition by buying a richer mix. So that's why I'm pretty confident we get in the back half, we see the margin snapping back towards that 50% that we've articulated as our long-term goal. We'll talk more about the mix of products and whatnot at the investor meeting. But the one thing I'd point you to is remember, something like networking, which is at atom-based server product that's going in. While it does have a lower ASP than the average within DCG, it has an ASP that's actually been going up and it has a very different cost structure than a Xeon does. So I won't just immediately assume that because it's a lower price segment of the market that it's a margin-hindered segment of the market because that's not the case. Let me take the margin side and then I will let Brian come in over the top to talk a little bit about the roadmap and how we think about that from the customer's perspective. From a -- first off, we haven't forecast 2017 margins. So we will give you the first glimpse of that at the investor meeting and then we put a formal stake in the ground when we get to next January. But I would say that there is nothing that I am seeing in the overall roadmap that for me is a significant headwind as we go into 2017. So we will give you a lot more insight in that in a few months. But I am not seeing anything that has me worried as we go into 2017. I guess what I would talk about is Kaby Lake. One of the things we have learned on 14-nanometers is how to make meaningful performance and improvements, both in the silicon and then with the silicon combined with the architecture. So we said we already started shipping Kaby Lake to our customers and OEMs. We're seeing meaningful performance across all of the various SKUs of Kaby Lake relative to Skylight. Kaby Lake's built off a Skylight core. And as a result, the die size does not significantly grow. So you don't see -- there's no driver in the silicon itself to shift the margin structure of this product. We're able to get the performance and feature enhancements with relatively small silicon increases but good improvement on the silicon -- raw silicon technology itself. So there's not an intrinsic driver that should say, die size got twice as big so margins are cut. There's nothing like that. And it comes in on a process technology that's mature with healthy yields and healthy cost structures. So from that perspective you get a nice performance boost at a good cost structure. Thanks, Matt. So my regional view would say that certain of the -- some North America and Western Europe has been stronger for us for some period of time, and it continues to be the stronger segment for us. As you said, South America, Latin America continues to be weak. We see weakness in Asia, but it did get a little bit better than in the past. And that combined with North America were the two drivers that made Q2 perform better than what we'd modeled in our high single digits. And as I said, I'm being relatively cautious in this and making sure that we put an estimate out there that we are very comfortable with. And that's why we've gone with -- stuck with our high single digit view of the year. Yes. And we are hearing that same thing from our customers. And as we go out and talk to CIOs, we are hearing the same thing. Those cycles, though, can sometimes take -- you will hear them, and then they sometimes can take some time to really kick in. So again, we kind of built that into the cautiousness of the second half and making sure that we know what we are going into the second half with. But we are hearing similar things around the enterprise conversion. It's comfort with Windows 10, ability to make that transition, they're wanting to do it on new hardware. So we haven't really tried to -- we have pretty widespread guess times and models right now on sizing the market, because we are still really learning. We've actually started to ship some sample units to customers already to let them try out and start to learn. Those are to the big COG service providers, is mostly who we're sending those to. You're going to see it enter as SSDs. You'll see those SSDs, both enterprise-class SSDs and also commercial consumer type SSDs. We've demonstrated in several live demonstrations, anywhere from 5 to 7, 8, 9, 10 times improvement in performance, depending on the workload through those SSDs. So you're going to see those be the first implications. When I think about where the big volume will come from, I think it will come in that DIMM form factor. You're going to see it in cloud applications, everything from machine learning, big data, anyplace where you have memory-intensive and where you can do in-memory applications. The 3-D Cross Point is going to be nicely configured for that. It allows you to bring large amounts of storage-like data into a memory-like performance. And that's the real key here. I also believe you will see it in consumer devices. You will see laptops and devices like that. Gaming machines, we think it will have gaming applications where you can preload in a cache-like environment the next level of your game. And so it loads almost instantly as you transition within the game. So there's going to be a variety of those. And actually the more we go and start to play with it, start to give it out to customers, the more types of applications and workloads we're finding that it can be used for. Sure. As I communicated, I think at the investor meeting or in the last six months, our goal is to get back to net cash zero. And one point I had predicted that that would happen in the back half of this year. The combination of business levels being lower from what we thought at the beginning of the year as well as some pretty significant restructuring charges will push that out. So that will happen sometime in 2017, although I do think we will make good progress towards net cash zero as we move into the back half. Today our net debt level is right around $5 billion. So we will take a big chunk out of that as we move into the back half. In terms of -- now that said, we're still generating excess free cash flow. You can see that even in the first half, even inclusive of the restructuring charges we did. And so you can see we did, I think $1.6 billion of buybacks in the first half. And we have a dividend yield that as of yesterday was about 3%. So I think you see us executing to the priorities that we had articulated. Thanks, C.J. Operator, I think we have time for two more questions. Sure. So let's just talk about modems. Really to stay on a leading edge modem, you need to have a yearly cadence of modem technology. And so we have just that, a yearly cadence laid out. We had the 7260 last year. We had the 7360 this year. We have a series of modems out. We've got them built out and planned for the next several years. We haven't publicly stated when we will bring it inside, but clearly we plan to. We will do that when the right point of intercepting the roadmap and getting the right performance off the 14-nanometers is required. Right now I am more concerned about getting the leading edge momentum going for us with the 7360 and then the follow-on in 2017, and really showing that we are a world-class modem company. Sure. So let me try and talk about why I am so confident in growth. We could talk about competition. And we'll see if that does not answer your question. When I think of the cloud, the cloud that we have today is really built on the backs of people. It's your Facebook data, it's your Salesforce data, it's your Twitter data. It's all data that is really across the devices that we pretty much handle day to day. The current estimates are if you look out into 2020, that average person will generate about 1.5 gigabytes a day of data off those devices. Those are going to be all your posts and pictures and all that kind of information. If you take a look at the average autonomous car in 2020, the estimates right now is it will throw off about 40 gigabytes a minute of data. If you take a look at the average autonomous drone doing some kind of scan looking for somebody lost in the forest or scanning a mine, it's going to throw off about 20 gigabytes a minute. If you take something like our replay technology that is filming in virtual reality a basketball game or a football game, it's throwing off 200 gigabytes a minute right now. And as we continue to refine the accuracy of that, that number will likely just grow. So it's that growth in data and the need to both process it at the edge, and then through the data center and into the cloud to be able to store it, to be able to apply machine learning to all of those applications, those all tell me that the cloud is going to continue to grow. It's going to be lumpy. These guys don't build out their data centers in a linear fashion. They go, they build out a big chunk of overcapacity so that they can go then sell that and have expansion space. And they don't build for a while. And so I know people worry about, is it slowing down? But these trends and data that tell me, no, it's not slowing down over the long term. And what you're really going to see is just the buying patterns and the build-outs of the various structures that are going up. As far as competition, there's always going to be competition in this market. I expect it. That's okay. We think of ourselves as competition, in fact. We are built on a model that says we have to build a continuous improvement of our products such that we are replacing ourself with a better cost per performance model over time. And so we know that even if there was no competition, the competition is we've got to build a product that's better and drives replacement as well as growth. And so, I look at the competition as it's welcome, it keeps us better, it's always been out there. There will always be somebody out there. But really what we have to do is build products that are so competitive that people want to replace our products with our new product. That then is one of the best models to use for making sure you stay ahead. Thanks, Vivek. Operator, can you go -- please go ahead and introduce our first questioner --  or last questioner, excuse me. So there certainly is a limit to the amount of overall debt that I'd feel comfortable with, but it's not something that we have articulated externally and it'll vary by the size of the Company and the cash flow. To my philosophy just generally, I'm not a believer in taking on debt to do stock buybacks. You really have not seen us do that. Obviously it's a Board decision, but I'm just sharing with you my view of it. I wouldn't take on debt in order to do buybacks or to do a special dividend or anything like that. You're welcome David, did you have a follow up? Sounds like you're all set, David. All right. Thank you all for joining us today. Operator, please go ahead and wrap up the call.","Thanks, guys. Just a question on the server expectations for the second half. What's given you the confidence that things are going to bounce back so nicely? And for my follow-up, you mentioned you started shipping the 7360. Was that material to Q2 or will it be material to the second half? And any comments on profitability there? Thanks, guys. God afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Stacy, you did a nice job relative to the full-year guidance, kind of giving us your expectation for PC demand for the year. I'm just kind of curious as you look into the third quarter, the guide is sort of the high end of normal seasonal, as you talked about. How would you characterize kind of your view of the PC business going into Q3? And to the extent that it's still a subdued view, is this really confidence in Data Center, or what other parts of the business would drive above seasonal -- or high end of seasonal, sorry? That's helpful, guys. Maybe for my follow-up, just looking at the Memory business. As you guys characterize, tough quarter in the June quarter, you analyze the operating loss, it's a fairly large number. I'm just kind of curious, have startup cost there peaked? Did we have another couple of quarters of startup costs going up in Memory? And I guess more importantly, as Dalion ramps and as you think about Cross Point, how should we think about your profitability goals longer term and what the fall-through on that business looks like as revenue does start to accelerate? Thank you. Great. Thank you so much. I wonder if you could talk about, first the Data Center, the growth, your mid-single digit growth for about three consecutive quarters. And I know you had higher expectations for that a few quarters ago. Can you talk about, is that entirely an enterprise phenomenon, or is that a timing issue around cloud? Just how should we think about the last few quarters of DCG? Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then with regards to the balance sheet, I noticed both day sales outstanding and days of inventory bumped up a little bit. And I hadn't expected that. Can you just talk about what drove that? Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. PC gaming has been a bright spot for the team with growth in the double digits year-over-year range for the past number of quarters. Your desktop ASPs were up again in Q2, maybe due to the strength here. Seems like the graphics guys are rolling out some new products. There appears to be a good pipeline of new games for the second half. So I guess the question is, did the PC gaming segment continue to drive double digits growth for the team in Q2? And how do you see that trending into the second half? Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on the deceleration in the IoT business in June, you talked about an inventory burn. Sorry if I missed this, but what vertical is that focused on? And does the team expect reacceleration on a year-over-year basis as you move into the second half of the year? And if so, what verticals are going to be driving the growth? Great. Thank you. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to verify, on the DCG growth target into the back half, it sounds like you need enterprise to keep getting better into the second half as well as for the cloud and comm side of DCG to significantly re-accelerate to get there. Cloud was up 9% year-over-year. It's good, but that's a significant deceleration. Can you sort of give us a feeling for what you need for enterprise into the back half and what drove the deceleration in the high growth parts of this business into Q2? So what gives you confidence in enterprise will continue to stabilize and that what we saw in Q1 is not a one-quarter blip, given it's been down pretty meaningfully for the last few years pretty consistently? Q2, I mean. Hi, guys. Thanks for let me ask a question. Given that dynamic in the cloud on the enterprise side within DCG, do you still expect a crossover in the percentage of revenues that those two generate in the back half of this year? Or is it pulled forward a little bit, or pushed out, given the dynamics that you've described so far? When you said, I believe at your last analyst meeting you talk about the cloud revenue, the percentage of DCG would be somewhere in the mid-30%s and that would cross over the enterprise-generated revenue in that. And that was therefore viewed as a point of acceleration for the entire group. Wondering, given the slower growth year to date in the business, if that crossover is going to be achieved in the time you expected? Okay. As my follow-up question, sticking with DCG then, is on the gross margin side. It sounds like you are expecting some pretty significant growth, not only in the unit side of the equation in DCG but also in the ASP side. And then you also talked about some of the ASP benefits that might happen in CCG, at least in the PC portion of it. If I put that all together, I'm a little surprised that either mix or ASPs, neither of those are mentioned in your gross margin reconciliation for it to go to 62% in the third quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how those dynamics fit into your gross margin? Great. Thank you. Just a clarification on some of your earlier comments on inventory and PC. You talked about the customers taking down the inventory a little bit less than you had expected in Q2. Can you clarify why they chose to do that? And I guess with the inventory levels right now, where do they stand relative to where you would expect them to be into the third quarter? Okay. As a follow-on to that, maybe you can clarify what you consider to be normal PC seasonality in the third quarter, because I think that's been changing over the past several years. Last year the build into the third quarter was a little stronger. Obviously there were some product launches there. How do you characterize the build this year relative to what we have seen last year and the year before? Great. Thank you. Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess it's kind of a follow-on to the DCG question that Ross had brought up in terms of margins. Does the DCG business, is obviously going to diversify itself some going forward with some of the new products that you're introducing and the networking business taking off. The operating margin percentage is down fairly sharply year-over-year. And I would expect that to ramp back up some as revenue reaccelerates, but maybe Stacy you could talk about what the long-term margin structure looks like from an operating margin perspective in DCG as the business diversified some? Thanks. Great, thank you. That's very helpful. And then I guess to follow up on, that sticking on margins, maybe you could talk a little bit about how adding the third chip on 14-nanometer may affect margins going into 2017 in the PC business to offset some of the 10-nanometer ramp costs you had talked about? I think it's a little bit of a different dynamic than we have seen with the business traditionally with the tick-tock approach. So any sort of broader comments you could give there about margins would be really helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you very much. Thanks. Brian, I know that you remain cautious overall in the PC market. But when you look at some of the third-party data it definitely seems like North America was better. Asia, Latin America, a little mix, I'm wondering has your view, at least on a regional basis, changed at all? The other thing that's been reported is that commercial models have seen some momentum. Windows 10 has been a catalyst. Your view on commercial enterprise, has that improved at all over the last 90 days? Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on Cross Point. You talked about stronger growth expectations looking over the next couple of years. Just curious if you could share what conversations you have had with customers, what use cases you've uncovered? And any thoughts in terms of sizing the market? That's very helpful. And I guess as a quick follow-up. Stacy, can you provide an update on your targeted capital structure here? And at what point with net leverage, net cash we should start to see more aggressive buybacks? Thanks for taking my question. For my first one Brian, I am curious, there are expectations of Intel becoming successful with your 4G modems in the back half. And I'm curious, how's the longer-term visibility around sustaining growth in the business? And just the timing as to when you can bring those products from foundry to your [facets]? As my follow-up, staying on the BCG team, are you still comfortable this can be a double digit growth business over the longer term? And I guess as part of that, what role does competition play into it with all the recent noise around [Sofbang and Bangar] presumably putting more resources into it. I understand there are no near-term implications, but just longer term how do you think about growth and competition in DCG? Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. Just following up from the earlier round. Can you give us some feel for your attitude to total amount of debt? You have a goal of net cash neutrality, but do you have an upper limit on the total amount of debt you're willing to carry? Might you choose at some point to repatriate overseas cash to bring down debt or pay dividends and stock purchases? Great. Thanks so much.

INTC,Q3 2016,2158,2962,4329,"Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's third-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, INTC.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; Stacy Smith, our Executive Vice President of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations; and our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Swan. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from all three of them followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Also, a brief reminder that this quarter we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on INTC.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. Thanks, Mark. Q3 was an outstanding quarter, which produced records in a number of product lines, and serves as evidence of our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices. As a great proof point, third-quarter revenue grew 9% over last year to an all-time record of $15.8 billion on broad-based strength across our businesses. I'd like to take a minute to share a few of the highlights with you now. I'll start with the client computing group, which had a stellar quarter. This team's focus on delivering an annual cadence of innovative new products, improving product costs, and driving operational efficiencies contributed to a remarkable 37% growth in CCG operating margins. The client computing group's revenue grew 5% over last year, but just as importantly, DCG is playing in a direct and impactful role in our transformation. In the data center group, revenue grew 10% year over year to a record $4.5 billion. We saw the growth segments of the data center group accelerating at a rate above our forecast. The cloud service provider segment was up 32%. In the [com] service provider segment, we continued to grow at a faster rate than the market, 16% growth, as the market converts to NFE and SDN and demand for our products increase. In addition, non-CPU adjacencies across DCG grew an impressive 34%. This category includes our new omni-path high-performance fabric, which is leading in performance and gaining design-win momentum. It includes our Silicon Photonics and our Xeon Phi, all of which began their ramps this year. However, enterprise revenue was down 3%, trending below our expectations of a roughly flat year over year. As a result, DCG revenue growth for the full year will likely be in the high single digits. Another key growth opportunity for Intel, our Internet of Things business, grew 19% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record of nearly $700 million. We saw strength across the board in retail, video, and transportation segments. Revenue in our memory business was approximately flat year over year. 3D NAND production at the Dalian factory is ramping ahead of schedule, with yields matching those of our other production facilities. We continue to see industry enthusiasm building for our ground-breaking new memory technology, 3D Crosspoint, and we're making steady progress toward bringing it into production. Intel's programmable solutions group, formerly Altera, was up 6% on strength in wireline, industrial, and broadcast segments. I'm very pleased with the integration of Altera into Intel. We continued to execute against our [deal thesis], and PSG has produced three consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth compared to Altera's results after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges. In the third quarter, we began sampling our Stratix 10 product, Intel's first FPGA produced on our own process technology, and also, the industry's first and only 14-nanometer FPGA. We are shipping our first co-packaged parts for the data center and are continuing to see opportunities for design wins with PSG products across many of Intel's businesses. PSG's results show the tremendous progress and execution. The Intel security business was up 6% over last year. Last month we announced that we will sell 51% of Intel security to private equity firm TPG, and establish a jointly-owned, independent cybersecurity Company named McAfee. This transaction will position McAfee to invest as an independent Company while allowing Intel to continue to participate in McAfee's success and growth. Intel's transformation continues and the restructuring program that we've announced in April remains on track. I'm really proud of the work our employees are doing to accelerate our strategy. A change of this magnitude is hard, and going through it has again reinforced just how talented, committed, and resilient this team is. And finally, I'd like to welcome Bob to the Company as our Chief Financial Officer. He brings a wealth of leadership experience to Intel, and his financial acumen and strategic insights will be an asset to the Company. At the same time, I'd like to thank Stacy for an outstanding nine years as CFO. He's been a great partner, and I'm excited to have his leadership in manufacturing, sales, and operations moving forward. Wrapping things up, I'm very pleased with our results in the third quarter. We introduced exciting new products, delivered strong financials, and continued to realign our resources to our strategy. The progress we're making leaves me increasingly confident in our transformation. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy. Thanks, Brian. In the third quarter, we achieved record revenue of $15.8 billion, and also achieved $5.1 billion in operating income. Revenue growth of 9% year over year is driven by solid growth across the client computing, data center, and Internet of Things groups. Gross margin at 64.8% was higher than expected, and up 3 points from the second quarter. Operating income grew 18% from a year ago. Earnings per share of $0.80 were up $0.14 from a year ago. The client computing group had revenue of $8.9 billion, up 5% year over year During the third quarter, we saw strengthening of demand and an inventory build in the worldwide PC supply chain. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating profit growing 37% from a year ago as revenue increased, costs came down, and investment levels declined. The data center group had record revenue of $4.5 billion, up 10% year over year. In the third quarter, we continue to see robust growth in the cloud segment of the business, which grew over 30% year over year, partially offset by a 3% decline in enterprise segment over the same horizon. The data center group had operating profit of $2.1 billion, down 1% year over year, as we increased investments and ramp Broadwell, the first 14-nanometer server product. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $689 million, growing 19% year over year, driven by strength in our retail, video, and transportation segments. Operating profit for the business was $191 million, up 27% year over year. Our memory business had revenue of $649 million, down 1% year over year. This segment had an operating loss of $134 million as a result of start-up costs for our China factory and costs associated with 3D Crosspoint. The programmable solutions group had revenue of $425 million, up 6% when compared to Altera's results from a year ago. Operating profit was $78 million. Our security business had revenue of $537 million, up 6% from a year ago. In the third quarter, we announced a newly formed, jointly owned, independent cybersecurity Company called McAfee. The transaction values the business at approximately $4.2 billion, and at deal close, we expect to realize a pretax gain on this sale of roughly $500 million when the transaction closes in the second quarter of 2017. The costs associated with the transaction are factored into our restructuring and spending guide. Post deal close, we will own 49% of the new Company. We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enables us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. This is demonstrated in our third-quarter results, as we generated $5.8 billion of cash from operations, purchased $2.5 billion in capital assets, repaid $1 billion in commercial paper, repurchased approximately $500 million of stock, and paid $1.2 billion in dividends. As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $15.7 billion, roughly flat to the third quarter. This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter, as we expect the worldwide PC supply chain to reduce the inventory. Since the last earnings call, our view of second-half 2016 revenue has increased, as a result of strength in the client computing and Internet of Things groups, partially offset by weakness in the enterprise segment of the data center. We are now forecasting the midpoint of the fourth-quarter gross margin to be 63%. Spending is expected to be approximately $5.2 billion. Intel is in the midst of a significant transformation. We are focusing on being more efficient, investing in higher growth segments, and with the McAfee transaction, we are focusing our business on core strategic areas. Given that, I would like to provide a little more context on each. We are on track to achieve the run-rate savings and employment reductions associated with the restructuring program announced earlier this year, and in fact, we are moving faster than we anticipated. In addition, the deal involving the Intel security group, which was announced in the third quarter, will result in additional restructuring charges, a pretax gain, and reduced spending levels in 2017. As a result of those restructuring charges, and the increased mix of retirements and European severances, we are increasing the restructuring and other charges forecast by $700 million to $2.3 billion. The majority of the remaining restructuring charges will be realized between now and the middle of 2017. We are on track to the original restructuring and focusing our business on core strategic areas. This is allowing incremental investments in critical areas like the data center, Internet of Things, and memory. The overall impact of the announced reductions, Intel security group transaction, and reinvestment is that we expect our 2016 spending as a percent of revenue to be down almost 1 point versus 2015, and we expect to achieve another 1 point reduction in 2017 as we accelerate our transformation. In the third quarter, we achieved record revenue and strong operating profit. But since this is my last earnings call, I would like to take the opportunity to provide some historical perspective on how the Company has changed over the 10 years since I've been attending these calls, which I really think shows the transformation of our business. Ten years ago, virtually the entirety of our business was tied to the PC market. Today, we have a diversified portfolio of growing businesses with roughly half of our profits coming from the data center and Internet of Things businesses. We are also a different Company in terms of how we look financially. Ten years ago, our revenue was approximately $35 billion with a gross margin of 52%. In 2016, we're on a path to almost $59 billion in revenue with a gross margin of 63%. Over the past 10 years, we've increased our dividend from $0.40 per share to $1.04 per share, and we've repurchased about $55 billion of stock. Looking forward, Intel is positioned with technology leadership, an amazing workforce, and significant market opportunity as we power the cloud at the heart of all of these smart and connected devices. I am excited about how we're positioned for growth and my next role in the Company, and about the leadership, experience, and continued focus on driving long-term shareholder value that Bob will bring as CFO. With that, let me turn it over to Bob for a few words. Thanks, Stacy, and thanks, Brian. I am both excited and very honored to be joining the team at Intel. The Company has had a profound impact on the world with industry-leading technologies, it has a great business model driven by Moore's Law, and an outstanding balance sheet. Additionally, I'm inheriting a top-notch, world-class finance organization. It's an extremely exciting time in the Company's history, as we transition from a PC-centric Company to one that powers the cloud in billions of smart connected devices. I am looking forward to the journey. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark. Okay. Thank you, Brian, Stacy, and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and a follow-up if you have one. Jonathan, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","Sure, and I would agree, we're not going to raise the flag and say everything's good again. If you take a look at this quarter, what we saw was an increased strength in the areas that have been strong in the past. So definitely the mature markets were a bit stronger. The one that was probably a little bit of a shift is China, it was a little bit better than we had forecasted as well. Enterprise was again strong. Consumer was better, but it's still not back to where we consider it -- where we'd like to see the consumer side. And it was a good mix between desktop and mobile products, laptops, and two-in-ones and devices like that. So it was an increase in what's been strong in the past is really what drove the growth for this quarter. Stacy, maybe -- this is Brian. Maybe let me help you just think about the data center from a larger perspective, right. As Stacy said, what you have to really take a look here is the growth areas that we said we were going to continue to grow in, the cloud service provider, the telco space, the networking and storage, networking specifically is some of our fastest growing areas of the data center. And in the adjacencies, which are all new, emerging markets for us around things like Silicon Photonics and Omni-Path fabric and all, all of those are growing at or above what we had forecasted. And doing quite well. And as Stacy said, across each of those, our ASPs are both increasing. And if you take a look at that, even if you go down to like an Atom server, the Atom-based server, yes, their ASPs are lower, but the margins are still quite healthy down there because their costs are quite a bit lower. So you've got to keep all of that into perspective as you look at the mix that goes across these. What happened this quarter is that we had anticipated the Enterprise to go from that low single-digit decline to roughly flat, and it just hasn't -- the enterprise market hasn't shored up there yet. We're working on tactics to shore that up over the next couple quarters, and we're still very convinced on the long-term path of -- that those growth areas that we described are going to be what drives the data center. Sure. I think there's two parts to this. Certainly a certain amount of the enterprise weakness, right, that has occurred over the last few years is certainly driven by movement of those enterprise applications to the cloud. And we're very comfortable. It doesn't really matter for us, from a product definition or product performance standpoint, whether it goes -- those applications go to the cloud or whether they stay in the enterprise. That said, there's several enterprises that we are in talks with that all want to grow their own private clouds, and they're really looking at how best to do that, when do they do that. So I think it's more the customer feedback we're getting that gives us some confidence that the enterprise side, with their own private clouds, will continue to see some improvement. It's not going to be a growth area, though, so don't take this as I'm saying, Stacy, that this is going to be a growth segment. What we're saying is, given what we're seeing from customers, we should see some level of stabilization or less of a decline. Didn't show up this quarter. We'll have to take a look at that as we move through into 2017. Sure, so first, to your first question, I 100% agree with what Stacy said. And I expect that these growing segments, that's why we focus on them so much and will be the dominant as we move out into the later parts of this decade. Your question on accelerators really is what you're asking when you take a look at GPUs and things like deep learning. The first thing you have to separate out is things like is-- are you talking about the deep learning on the learning portion or the scoring portion? So we don't look at accelerators as cannibalistic, because you still have to have a Xeon system with those when you go to actually do the implementation of the deep learning application. The second thing we tell you is that we actually had worked over the last two years or so to really implement a much broader collection of accelerators, when you think about these. If you want to think about the rates of performance of each one of these, you have FPGAs which are accelerators, and we see those accelerators go into everything from networking devices to machine learning applications. Those have high levels of flexibility that can be programmed on the fly, but maybe not quite the performance. Then you have GPUs. GPUs do have, as you say, good accelerating performance in certain linear algorithms. Those are quite good, and we have our Xeon Phi in that space. And then the highest performance area are ASICs, where they're very workload-specific and designed around the algorithm specifically, and you saw our applications of Nervana. We also did an acquisition of Movidius earlier this quarter. Those are all very specific workloads around machine learning that are ASIC-driven and even give higher performance. So we look at those accelerators as being enhancing this growth. You sell a Xeon typically with that so it doesn't cannibalize the business. We believe we have the lightest really offerings of these accelerators from FPGAs through the Xeon Phi and then into ASIC-driven devices. Yes, this is Brian. Just having managed CapEx in this Company for years, you really have to take a look at our annual guidance, because literally, within the quarter, or quarter to quarter, the tools will push out. We'll try to always be more efficient and/or you'll have these kinds of one-time upside as things combine, come together. So we expect our annualized run rate for this year to be the $9.5 billion or so that we forecasted, and don't expect that quarterly run rate to be indicative of Q4. I'd tell you it's some mix. We had some indications from some of our partners that there was some inventory building tied to various SKUs. We're also watching the sell-through as it goes all the way through the OEMs and out into the retail sectors. So it's never a guess on our part. It's always some combination of that data set that is what the OEMs tell us, what we see in retail and our discussions with retail, and even just our own -- we go out and collect that data in the retail space of what people are doing, what's the basically population density at a place like Best Buy? How many people are out there buying PCs versus something else in the store? We compile all that data to give that forecast. But like Stacy said, we're not talking about a major shift in the inventory. We're talking about a couple of days. But a couple of days when you ship 1 million units a day is a big number when you take a look at the ASPs in 1 million units a day. So it doesn't take a big swing. We're not talking weeks here; we're talking a couple of days. Yes, it absolutely did. We tried to talk about the numbers in the preview to the start of just showing you by segment there, cloud, telco, networking and storage, and then the adjacencies. They all grew at or above our forecast. Those are still, as we talked about earlier in one of the questions, growing in a percentage of our overall data center business. So they weren't quite enough to offset the 3 percentage decline in the enterprise side. But absolutely, that was the story for the quarter. We're quite happy, and I think our thesis of what continues to drive their growth is holding. When we go out and talk to our partners and customers about what's driving cloud growth, what's going to drive the networking and storage requirements out in time, we start to look at devices like autonomous cars and the IoT network in general, all of those things are driving large requirements into those data centers in those growth segments. And so that's what gives us the comfort that, yes, this will continue. And our forecasts are holding in those spaces. I'll start with the first and then I'll let Stacy talk about the margin. Absolutely first, as we said and I think Stacy said a couple minutes ago as well, at our Dalian, China factory, we are now running wafers. The yields are quite good; they're as good as our existing factories. So you'll see that factory now ramp through the first half, roughly, of next year, and as most of that spending will occur in that same time frame as far as adding the equipment to facilitate that ramp. From there then, it's just purely just running the volume and continuing to grow in that space. That's primarily 3D NAND. Again, we believe we have cost performance that is quite good relative to the rest of the market. With the 3-D Crosspoint, we are in the process of shipping samples now to customers by the -- as we go through this quarter, we'll ship thousands of samples to customers. We're targeting to start or to finish qualification at the end of this quarter, and that ramp really starts -- it's really a 2018 ramp for that product. So you'll see, again, the revenue and, hence, the costs go down on 3-D Crosspoint as we go into next year as well. Hey, just a correction. The team here just caught me on. I think I had my years off. So on the 3-D Crosspoint, it will be qualified at the end of this quarter. We're shipping thousands of samples to customers. We're shipping samples already. We'll ship thousands through this quarter. And it ramps in 2017. I think I said by mistake 2018. I'm sorry, I'm just -- too many years that we're talking through here. So ramp in 2017, revenue growth in 2017, samples, thousands in the fourth quarter and qualified at the end of the quarter. Sorry for that confusion. Sure. So I think I heard all of your questions. But I think your question is -- you can correct me if I got it wrong, A, how much of the enterprise slowdown that we saw is being driven by cannibalization, basically, of people waiting for Purley, aka Skylake platform? And then what are the real features that we're looking for that drive Skylake performance? Did I get that right? So first, it's always very difficult for us. If you take a look at Broadwell, the Broadwell platform, the performance is quite good. What we find is that each one of these generations, as long as you stay on this cost-performance curve, people are willing to go buy those that are running these cloud platforms quite quickly. And so we're seeing demand for Broadwell from the cloud service providers, from the networking and telco side, and quite strong. So we don't think we see -- if we were going to see performance-based cannibalization, you'd see it in those real high-level performance sectors first actually, I would think. So we don't see that. On the Purley platform, we're actually starting to sample those products already to some of the leading-edge customers. And they're seeing not only just an overall TCO performance advantage that we typically see with each one of these, but this also continues our integration of things like the Omni-Path fabric. It has more integration of the Silicon Photonics. So it's those adjacency functions that are quite strong as you -- and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these. There will be a second generation of Purley that includes 3-D Crosspoint. It allows pooling of memory, and then there will be future ones that allow additional pooling of things like FPGAs. So each one of these now adds some additional features across the rack that really helps in the overall system performance. First, I do want to recognize that our OEM partners are putting out some great products, and I think you're going to have to take a look at this and really ask -- that's a pretty interesting scenario and I'm very hesitant to this. But typically, Stacy's right. If ASPs go up across the board at the system level, it tends to float all boats. So our OEM partners would see an increase. We'd see an increase. The other partners within that infrastructure would see it. We really more think of our pricing, though, as value-based. So as we bring out new products and bring out new features, we make sure that the value-based pricing is there and that people are either getting more value for the same price or quite a bit more for a slightly increased price. So I think that's such a unique scenario, as it just over, across the board, all of the sudden one day prices go up, actually, we wouldn't necessarily flow through that ASP to our end partners because we didn't necessarily drive that from a new features. If it happens with our 10-nanometer launch and it's because of features, then we do add those. So we do it based on what value we provide to the end user and our OEM partners. Probably the best example of that is the gaming space. We continue to see -- we put out the [case] SKU, a 12-core monster, and we wonder how many people are going to go buy it and we find we're sold out. So I think that's an example where, quote, our ASPs go up but it's really a mix function. Otherwise, it's going to be -- we always just do pricing based on value and features that we bring. Operator, I think we have time for two more questioners. Yes, sure. So I'm trying to make sure I really think about what question you're asking. From a -- can we sustain the double-digit growth? We absolutely believe that we can, and we've tested that with our -- the deals that we see on the plate going forward. So we've forward tested that. And we've looked at our product road maps and what we're bringing out. And we've got products like Atlas Peak and Atlas Peak 2 that are coming that are Broxton-based products that are quite strong and quite capable in this segment, and priced and designed right for that. The segments are going to continue to believe -- be, we believe, the video analytics segment; that continues to go well. There are other segments of the industrial segment that we believe will continue to grow on machine automation, machine factory automation, think of it as factory automation. The retail segment will continue to be an area where it continues to grow. And then automotive, and you saw us make deals, for example, this quarter with BMW on autonomous driving, which is a little further out. But that's just an example. You'll also see products from Land Rover and a variety of other OEMs that are a mix of everything from autonomous driving programs to in-vehicle infotainment-type systems. And those systems are quite -- we're thinking of them more and more as servers on wheels, as you start looking at all of the adjacencies too. They're needing connectivity. They're needing storage. They're needing Silicon Photonics for moving the infotainment, basically the graphics video around the system. They use FPGAs for accelerators, like we talked about earlier. So when we look across those segments and we test it out, we do believe we can continue that. Those are also high compute areas, and it's what gives us the confidence in the margin functions as well. They tend to reuse a lot of our intellectual property from the PC segment and carry that down over into it. That's one of the real strengths of Intel's integrated device manufacturing business model. And so the amount of investment required to bring those to market are less than if you start from scratch and that's your only product. That's what gives us the confidence in the margin space as well. Sure. So I think you really want to think the modem space as really an annual cadence. I think that's what it's taking us a while to get to is to get to that annual pace. But we really believe we're on a clip now. As you said, the 7480 is now qualified. As you said, it's qualified at AT&T there. We typically go then out and around the world. So you'll see it at many of the same places that the 7360 got qualified, in Europe, in China, other parts of southeast Asia. So those will be ongoing now. And you should just think about we're really targeting modem technology advancements on that annual basis, and typically, you're right; they get qualified in the third and fourth quarter of the year before. And then customers start to roll out those devices, typically, more towards the second half of the following year. So you should see these things start to show up in devices in the second half of 2017. And you should just think about that from this business from here on. We should come out with another series next year at this time with the 2018 target. That's really our business model for the modems moving forward.","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. First question on DCG, you took the number down for Q4. Curious how we should think about contribution from enterprise looking into 2017, when you think that could stabilize. And then as you start to think about greater contributions from hyperscale and networking, is that 10% to 15% sustainable or should we be thinking high single digits going forward? Thank you. Hi, CJ. This is Stacy. So, let me take the first part of that question. So yes, as we just said on the call, what we're seeing in the data center is very strong growth rates in the cloud, very strong growth rates in networking and storage, as those areas become virtualized and our products extend into those areas. And then we saw some weakness in the enterprise in Q4 -- or Q3, and that's what we're expecting for Q4. I think we're going to hold off on providing a forecast for 2017 at this time. We would normally provide that to you in January, and then have a much more in-depth conversation in the investor meeting in February. Okay. Very helpful. And on the PC front, given the volatility there, I wouldn't expect you guys to put the flag down and say that we've completely stabilized. But curious what trends you can speak to in terms of growth, perhaps, in emerging markets and what that speaks to in terms of the trajectory for unit demand from here. Operator, please go ahead and introduce our next questioner. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, DCG revenue's up 10% year over year. Operating profit down year over year. I know you had highlighted some increased investments. But we also have cloud growth and networking and some of the other non-CPU stuff that's been growing as well. How should we think about that change in the growth drivers in terms of impacting the margins over the last year? And how should we think about the likely margin trends for the business as we go into next year? I'll take that, and then Brian may want to talk about more of the longer term. It's not a driver in what we saw in the third quarter. There really are the two issues. We have been very consciously increasing investment there. We see a tremendous long-term opportunity, so that's been an ongoing process for us. But then the thing that really kicked in this quarter is they're ramping their first 14-nanometer server product, which is Broadwell for the server market, and that -- those first products coming out on that product line are fairly expensive. To the mix question, it doesn't really drive things probably as much as you would expect. We have very strong product margins across the portfolio of server products in the enterprise or in the data center, ranging from enterprise to storage to networking. And in fact, when we look at the server ASPs, we actually saw ASPs up across the board in every one of our server categories, so NP, DP. And so it really is a mix impact of what you see happening this quarter, where it was a little weaker on enterprise and a little stronger in places like networking. Thank you. For my follow-up, I'd like to touch on the last point you just made. So enterprise is, like you said, disappointing this quarter. But let's be honest, enterprise has been in decline for years. Why would it stabilize? What would it start growing? Why is the -- I know we probably talked about this before, but why isn't the cloud grout that we're seeing in the enterprise indicative of that cloud growth? I don't understand why we should expect that business to ever turn around. Can you give us some color on that? And just on a tactical basis, Stacy, to reinforce, our forecast now for the data center for Q4 also is not including improvement in this segment of the business. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question and before I forget, thanks and good luck to Stacy in his new role. Thank you. So first question is, again, staying on the data center theme, can you quantify the enterprise mix in DCG now? And is that required to be flat in order to maintain the double-digit growth in DCG or can it actually start growing double digit if the growth in other areas remains at this current pace, just because of the mix effect? So let me take a shot at the quantification question. And again, I think we'll -- Brian talked about this bullishness on the long term for the data center, but we'll hold off on specific CAGRs and 2017 forecasts to both earnings and then the investor meeting. On the -- I think you're referring back to what I showed a year ago, which was the size of the enterprise versus the size of the data center for the -- or size of the cloud for the server segment of DCG and that we were heading towards a crossover between those. Again, we'll update that explicitly come February. But based on what we've seen this year with really robust growth still occurring in the cloud, so again, this quarter over 30% and a weaker than expected enterprise, I think that crossover point pulls in. And then I think you have a phenomenon that says the cloud portion of the enterprise becomes so big and continues to grow at a fast pace that we can certainly maintain a robust growth rate, even if the enterprise segment is not growing to slightly weak. And as my follow-up, a longer-term question. I think there's a debate in the industry that computation is becoming more parallel with this growth in deep learning and machine learning, which benefits products like GPUs more than CPUs. I'm wondering, would you agree with that and do you think this parallel computing market is incremental or cannibalistic for Intel? Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on gross margins. In your Q4 guide, you have memory and higher factory start-up costs on 10-nanometer working against you. But I was curious when you would expect these items to fade and potentially provide a tailwind to gross margins. So this is Stacy. That's a good question. So typically, on the shape of start-up costs, you would expect that 10-nanometer costs go up in the back half of this year, as you're seeing. They stay high into the first two to three quarters of next year, and then they start to fall off in the back half of next year. So I'll just stick with that for now and then leave it to Bob to show you the start-up cost trends, as he thinks that that's important. On the memory costs, what you're seeing is really two impacts. One is the start-up costs associated with Dalian, or China, factory for memory, and then some of the first wafers coming out for 3D NAND and 3-D Crosspoint. And I'd expect that that starts to get better into next year. Hard to pick the quarter, but it should become a tailwind as we get into 2017. Okay. Great. As my follow-up, I have a question on CapEx as well. Based on your annual guide, I think the implied Q4 number is close to $3.5 billion, which is clearly a pretty big number. Should we take this as a new normal for Intel, or is this a one-off quarter where you're spending aggressively in both the core business and in memory and that the quarterly run rate going forward should revert to somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range? Thank you. I think if you go back to the guide at the -- I think we probably talked about it some time prior April, that I pointed to Q4 as probably being a pretty high CapEx quarter. And it's the combination of where we're at in purchasing the first production set for 10-nanometer and where we're at with the memory factory in China. So I think you're seeing some lumpiness here. I wouldn't run rate that out. Very helpful. Thank you so much. Thanks, Toshiya. Hi, guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question is just relative to what's embedded within PCs for the calendar fourth quarter. It's getting a little bit more difficult to track because of CCG, including the mobile. And if you look at the volume growth in the September quarter, it was clearly above normal seasonal trends for the core PC business. How much below seasonal do you think PCs will be in the calendar fourth quarter, and how are you guys thinking about the inventory channel management in Q4? I'd say from an end-market standpoint, it's pretty seasonal. And then from our business, it's the impact that Brian and I both talked about, which is we saw some strengthening of demand in the third quarter. We saw some refilling of the pipeline, which was lean coming in. And then in Q4, we're expecting seasonal end demand but some depletion of inventory pipeline. And it doesn't take much. If you think about the size of the PC market, you're down to changes in inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain that are measured in days or certainly less than a week of inventory that shifts around. Got it, and then, guys, maybe as my follow-up, all year long, you guys have been giving what's turned out to be conservative gross margin guidance by quarter. You've been beating that guidance, in part, this quarter helped by all the PC volume. But I'm just curious, as you look at the calendar fourth quarter, I understand the headwinds coming from memory and 10-nanometer start-ups, but what about some of the tailwinds from14-nanometer? You're going into a period now where you're reaching mature yields in PCs on 14. You should start to be reaching mature yields on servers for 14. How much of a tailwind is that? And are we looking at another quarter of conservative guide on the gross margin line? I can only say I'm sure Bob will do a better job of forecasting gross margin than I have done., I highlighted for you the two big items from Q3 to Q4, which is the things that are worth a point, and it's, as stated, the increase in 10-nanometer start-up costs and what we see going on in the memory business for the elements that I saw. Yes, I think we'll see some slight benefit associated with 14-nanometer. I also think we'll be down a little bit in terms of PC volume, but those are all relatively small impacts to the gross margin forecast. Thanks, guys. Thanks, John. Hi, guys. My first question's on the CCG side of things. Specifically, in the third quarter, you talked about the ASPs year over year in desktops and notebooks and then overall. I think the ASPs were up 6% in CCG, but the desktop and notebook side were both well below that. Is that just the contra revenue still in there? Or is there anything we can read through onto the mobile business, given those differences? Yes, that's a great question. So yes, you -- and we published what we saw happen in notebook and desktop ASPs. The piece that's missing, and it's relatively small, but it has a fairly big impact on the average is that within the phone and tablet products, we saw relatively less volume in Q4, so we got -- or Q3, sorry, we got some mix effect. And that ASP is up dramatically on a year-on-year basis as a result of the abatement of the contra revenue program. So that's the missing piece you need to get to the overall platform ASP math. Great, and as a follow-up, switching over to the OpEx side of things. Stacy, in your script, you mentioned about the OpEx to revenue improving by about 1 point this year, year over year, and then again, another 1 point next year. Can you just walk us through a little bit about what that means, either from a linearity perspective or an absolute dollar perspective. Any more color would be appreciated. Sure. I'd be happy to do that. So let me just -- let me take you all the way back to -- because I think this gets very confusing, because we obviously had the restructuring program in place. We now have the spinout or the divestiture, excuse me, of the Intel security business. The timing of those things will play out differently over the course of next year. So I just thought it was best to clean all of this up and give you one metric for the year that summarizes everything. And so starting with restructuring, it's on track. When you look at the savings that we've already generated this year, really the only adjustment to the spending guide that we've made when we started the restructuring is the fact that profits and revenue is up, and we have some profit and revenue-dependent spending. You can see we're over three quarters saving on the order of $700 million. You can think of that as an annualized run rate of a little north of $1 billion of savings that then rolls into next year. Then we'll get some incremental savings. We throw McAfee into the mix here, and we're going to make some reinvestments, as we've talked about in some of the areas that are important, think of data center and IoT and memory. And so when you add all that up, to just give you an all-in number that captures the full calendar 2017, what we're expecting is that from the starting point of 2015, we're down about 1 point in 2016, and then we should be down on the order of another 1 point next year in 2017 with all of this all in, the restructuring, McAfee, and the reinvestment. I hope that helped. Yes, that did. Thank you and congratulations on your new gig. Thank you, sir. Thanks, guys. Just on the PC, you guys were pretty much first to call the inventory burn in Q1 of this year. In terms of your call for inventory burn in the PC channel for Q4, is this reflected in your order book? Is this what your customers and channel partners are telling you? Or is this you guys think that, hey, things were a little too good in Q3 so they have to ease up a little bit in Q4? I would just add, the order book is much less meaningful than it used to be, because in many cases, we hold inventory at a hub at our customer's location. The cancellation policy is such that they only pull demand when they need it. We have policies to make sure we're not creating false incentives for them to take demand they don't want. So while we do have some indication of what they want, it can change on a daily basis. Got it. Great. And then for my follow-up, a question on inventory. So sales were up over $2 billion, but your inventory only went down a little bit. Can you just comment on why that happened and where utilization rates are going? What you feel comfortable as far as inventory levels go, does it worry you at all? Yes, it came in pretty much right where I was expecting, Chris. What we saw is a reduction in CPU inventory in the third quarter, and even within that, a pretty sizable reduction in first-generation 14-nanometer products being replaced by second-generation 14-nanometer products. So that played out as expected. And then we saw some increases in other areas in inventory, non-CPU areas. And then, we're still on track. I was looking at the -- what we're expecting from a sales standpoint, and what we're expecting from overall builds and yields and everything else, we're still on track to have inventory come down in Q4, which is what I signaled on the last call. Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to circle back on DCG, just when you look at the way September played out and as you look into December, was enterprise really the only area that changed? And I'm just trying to understand. You talked about mix, the networking. Was there any difference. You had also talked about lumpiness in cloud. Did that all play out as you expected? Thanks. And then just on the [non-volatile group] you've been spending a lot of money. Another big CapEx in Q4 here. Can you just talk about when the capacity additions could lead to revenue? And then as you look at the operating margin of that business, when could it be a positive contributor? Let me -- I'll hit on the margin, but I do want to do a shout-out to the China factory team. I was just out there and Brian was being a little humble. The yields on their first production material matched the yields on the mature production facility, which is a phenomenal result for a factory. So they're doing quite well. In terms of the overall margin, if you look at the -- let's just focus on Q3. What we saw in Q3 is an improvement in the underlying NAND business being offset by increased start-up costs associated with Dalian, China, and some increased costs associated with 3-D Crosspoint. As Brian said, when we get into the first half of next year, those products are ramping. And so we should start to see pretty significant improvements in the overall P&L because that headwind, if you will, goes away and we have a very competitive, very cost competitive product line that we're selling in the marketplace. Thanks. Hey, guys, thanks for the question. Welcome, Bob, and congratulations on your guys' PC number. Do you guys think that there is some cannibalization here of Broadwell from those waiting for the release of the Purley platform next year? And also, how do you guys view the value prop for Purley? You guys have a faster interface there, more pins and IO. But do you think there's some killer feature there that makes Purley much stronger than typical platform ramp? Yes. I'm just trying to gauge if there could be a reacceleration in DCG around Purley. Great. Thanks for that. And then a lot of discussions that I've had with the channel recently have been fairly positive around PC ASP increases next year. And part of this is the mix towards enterprise as consumer mix down. But others are pointing to an inflection in ultrabooks, thin and light. So let's say we got a massive ASP increase in laptops, like they're up 10% or something like that. What fall-through would we expect for CPU ASPs? 100% of that. I mean -- (multiple speakers) So first let's -- it's ASP, it all flows through. And if I can just add, the way we would see that is actually with a mixing up. We don't raise our pricing. But the way you articulated this, if it's a bunch of high-end notebook ultrathins, thin and lights, we would see a mixing up of our overall demand. And in fact, it is one of the phenomenons that we've been seeing. I think we've done a good job of creating a differentiated product line. And this quarter, we saw great sales of I-7s and notebooks. And so I think it's consistent with what you're seeing in your channels. Great. Thanks for the detail. Thank you very much. My first question is, I think you had said at the spring analyst meeting that the enterprise would be a little bit less than half of DCG this year, revenue-wise. Can you right-size us on what enterprise will be as a percentage of DCG just in the fourth quarter? This is Stacy. I think I took a stab at this earlier, but let me just reiterate what I said. To be clear, I was talking CPUs, enterprise server CPUs. And so if you take the slides that I showed back a year ago, we've seen robust growth rates in the cloud. We've seen less-than-expected growth rates in the enterprise. So if anything, we've pulled in those crossover points. Beyond that, we haven't given a new percentage, and that would be something that we would logically talk about when we give the longer-term perspective to the market in this coming February investor meeting. Got it. Okay. And then I want to ask a question on the mobile losses. I know that you don't break out MCG anymore. But I think I asked you last call about feeling good about this $800 million improvement in losses this year. That would get you to roughly a loss of 2.2 to 2.3 in the former MCG. Can you talk in light of the iPhone win, can you talk maybe how you think about the degree to which you could get further improvement in that number next year? Thanks. Sure. So first off, let me just say as is our standard practice, we don't talk about our customer -- what technology they use inside their products in this space. So I'm not going to confirm or anything on a particular win. But I'll take you back to the mobile loss here. So as you got right, we no longer have a mobile segment; we haven't for a while. We had articulated that in 2015 we expected to improve the loss by $800 million. We actually ended up closer to $1 billion. We said, hey, based on everything we know of what's going on with contra revenue and investments and margin improvements and all of that, that we'd expect something on the order of an $800 million improvement in 2016. Everything I know from there would say we're on track or exceeding that, just because we know that as we've gone through our restructuring, we've made some further disinvestments. We've, as you just heard earlier, our volume's a little lower, our contra revenue's looking a little lower, the product margins all look good. So I'm not seeing anything that would say it's smaller. If anything, it's going to be bigger in terms of the overall savings. And I do just want to reiterate, it's impossible for us to detangle it going forward. Where you really see this is in the CCG operating results, and as we started this call, they had phenomenal operating margins this quarter. And everything went right. They had revenue growth. They saw unit costs coming down. They're making, I think, prudent disinvestment decisions. When you add all that up, they become a real cash and profit driver for the Company. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the IoT business, it's good to see the reacceleration in growth. Can you just talk about the sustainability of the double-digits year-over-year growth trends and the sustainability of the 20%-plus operating margins on a go-forward basis? I know you mentioned broad-based strength across the verticals. Maybe you can just also talk about some of the product segments that are powering this growth. Great, and then thanks for the insights there. On the cellular modem front, obviously the team is driving good success here with the 7360 this year. Looks like you guys are continuing to drive the road maps. I notice that your next-generation platform, the 7480, was just qualified at AT&T just this month. This was actually about the same time last year that you guys qualified the 7360 at AT&T. Now that it's qualified, can you just help us understand when should we expect 7480 to show up in mobile devices? Would this be 2017, and any other color you can provide us in terms of other global carriers that you've qualified this new chip set with? Thank you. Great. Thank you all for joining us today and, Jonathan, please go ahead and wrap up the call.

INTC,Q1 2017,2455,3714,1166,"Thank you, Crystal, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. And finally, I'd like to draw your attention to a change we've made to our guidance practices for the current quarter and full year. Beginning with today's earnings release for the first quarter of 2017, our business outlook will speak only as of the date of our quarterly earnings releases, bringing our practices in line with virtually all of our peers. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. Thanks, Mark. The first quarter marked a great start to the year. Coming off both Q4 and full year records in 2016, Q1 revenue was up 7% over the first quarter of last year, a record Q1. And operating margin was up 20%. It was another milestone in our transformation from a PC-centric company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Average selling prices or ASPs grew meaningfully across our PC, data center and IoT business, reflecting the market's demand for performance and our segmentation strategy. And our memory business set an all-time record revenue. At our investor meeting in February, I outlined our strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I also detailed our top 4 priorities for the year: growing the data center and adjacencies; ensuring a strong and healthy PC business; growing IoT and devices; and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. That's the framework we're using to measure our success throughout the year, and I'd like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far. First, the data center and its adjacencies. DCG grew 6% year-over-year despite a headwind resulting from a 14-week first quarter last year. The cloud service provider revenue was up 18%. The comms service provider segment was up 12%. And enterprise was down 3%, while non-CPU adjacencies grew more than 20% across all of the segments. Data center microprocessor ASPs were up in total across every product line, underscoring the market's demand for performance to transmit, aggregate and analyze data. We're also on track for midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake microprocessor. Skylake delivers significant performance gains across a wide range of workloads. For example, Skylake will include AVX-512 extensions that will deliver a 2x improvement in floating point operations per clock over the current generation, a gain that will have an especially high impact on HPC and artificial intelligence workloads. And last month, we announced the formation of the artificial intelligence product group, bringing together all of our AI hardware and software assets and all of our AI engineering expertise across the company into a single group to accelerate our development of a full stack of AI solutions and explore novel approaches that will shape the next generation of AI products. Second, a strong and healthy client business. Our annual cadence of product innovation, combined with a thoughtful segmentation strategy, continued to produce strong mix, which drove higher ASPs. This trend, along with our ramping modem business, drove revenue up 6% and operating margin up 60% over last year. Our expectations for the PC unit TAM haven't changed since we last talked with you. We're expecting a mid-single-digit percentage decline in the unit TAM. Our ASPs, however, are trending ahead of expectations and are contributing to our slightly higher revenue expectations for the full year. Third, we've highlighted the importance of growing the IoT business as we drive and benefit from the rise of billions of smart and connected devices. IOTG revenue was up 11% year-over-year, where we saw strength in our industrial, video and automotive segments. We also announced our intention to acquire Mobileye, a highly profitable, fast-growing leader in computer vision for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The transaction will combine mobilized expertise in computer vision with Intel's expertise in high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and connectivity. Together, we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and services opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud-to-car solutions faster and at a lower cost. And finally, we emphasized the execution in memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 55% year-over-year in a tight supply environment; while Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continues to ramp 3D NAND production and is delivering outstanding product yields. We also shipped our first Optane SSDs for the data center and our Optane memory solution, which is available online now and in PC OEM systems later this quarter. In our Programmable Solutions Group, revenue declined 7% over the last year after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decline was due to a weakness in the data center and comms segment, partially offset by growth in industrial and auto and consumer. We also announced an important pilot program with Alibaba cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, for our cloud-based FPGA acceleration service. We're making good progress against our 4 top priorities for the year and our transformation goals. We're improving the profitability and health of our PC business. At the same time, our investments in the data center, IoT, memory and FPGAs are paying off with significant combined revenue growth. These are purposeful investments that will position Intel for years to come. At the same time, we recognize that there is an opportunity and responsibility to be more focused and efficient as a company, a goal we can achieve without compromising our most important investments: our transformation or our future. Focus was one of our objectives in establishing McAfee as an independent cybersecurity company just weeks ago, and it is with efficiency in mind that we're making an important commitment to our owners today. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which I expect to reach no later than 2020. Following a 1 percentage point improvement from 2015 to 2016, we forecasted an additional 1 percentage point improvement in spending in 2017, and we're now expecting to do a little better than that. While we expect revenue growth to play a role in achieving these targets, hitting this goal will require spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities. To sum up the quarter, we're off to a good start and executing well against our priorities. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, a powerful segmentation strategy and growing profitability in our client business. We're growing our data center, IoT and memory businesses as customers see data as a competitive advantage and look to Intel as a partner that can help them create, analyze and unlock the value of massive and growing flood of data. And finally, we are committing ourselves to a set of important new productivity goals intended to create value for our owners. With that, I'll hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Brian. 2016 was a record year for Intel, and 2017 is off to a strong start. We executed on several important milestones in the quarter. We delivered on innovative product and technology road maps across the business. Fab 68 in Dalian continued its impressive ramp. And Intel's transformation continued with the planned acquisition of Mobileye for autonomous driving and the sale of the Intel Security Group. Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $3.9 billion, up 20% year-over-year. And earnings per share of $0.66 was up 22% year-over-year. Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. First quarter operating margin was 27%, up 3 points year-over-year, and gross margin came in at 63%, up 0.5 point year-over-year. Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year-over-year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program. Let me touch briefly on our segment performance. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We continue to see the worldwide PC supply chain operate at healthy levels. Client ASPs were up 7% year-over-year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong. This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG&A allocations. The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.5 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of technology development and SG&A cost, higher product cost as we transitioned to 14-nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year-over-year, driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit for the business was $105 million, down 15% year-over-year from increased investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and technology development spending. Our memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year-over-year, with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations. This segment had an operating loss of $129 million largely driven by costs related with 3D XPoint and start-up costs for our memory capacity. The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. Operating profit was $92 million, flat year-over-year after adjusting for acquisition-related impacts. Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million, and operating profit was $95 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter. Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress: first, invest in our business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In the quarter, we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations. We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock. In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $235 million of pretax gains. At quarter-end, cash and other long-term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 million. Total debt was $25.8 billion. Today, we announced an increase in our share buyback authorization by $10 billion. Currently, we have approximately $15 billion authorization. We expect to continue to offset dilution from our stock-based programs and opportunistically reduce our outstanding share count over time. Now let me turn to guidance. First, some context. First, while we see strong momentum in client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of revenue for the year, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third-party analysts. We feel great about our annual cadence and product innovations with new product launches planned this year, including Skylake for data center, 8th Generation Core, 64 Tier 3D NAND SSDs and further extensions to our Optane product line. Second, we continue to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year and our Fab 68 in Dalian ramping to be able to supply higher demand levels. Third, the data center business has solid momentum with the midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake processor. And fourth, as I indicated earlier, we completed the sale of the Intel Security Group. We expect to realize a pretax gain of approximately $375 million and a tax liability of approximately $850 million. This results in a GAAP tax rate of 39% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in the second quarter. And last, as Brian talked about earlier, we are committed to increasing efficiency as a company, and we are making an important commitment to our owners today. We expect to reduce our spending as a percent of revenue by 2 points from 2015 to 2017, and our plans are to continue to drive efficiencies in how we operate the business over time. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which we expect to reach no later than 2020. As a result, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $60 billion and our EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $2.85 per share. As we look to the second quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year excluding Intel Security and up 6% including Intel Security. We expect operating margins to increase by 3 points year-over-year; gross margins to be up 1 point at approximately 63%; and spending to be approximately $5.2 billion, flat year-over-year. We expect our spending as a percent of revenue to be down 2 points in the first half of the year versus last year as we make solid progress in increasing efficiency in the company. We expect EPS to be approximately $0.68, up 15% year-over-year. We feel good about where we are 90 days into our 3-year journey. We exceeded our expectations for Q1 and increased our profit expectations for the full year. At the same time, we are investing in the future by expanding our TAM from $45 billion to $220 billion. We are already seeing an impact with our growth-oriented businesses up double digits collectively as we continue to transform the company from a PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud. With that, let me turn it over to Mark. All right. Thank you, Brian and Bob. (Operator Instructions) Crystal, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","Brian, I'm curious on the data center growth. The growth rate is now below 6% in Q1. Are you still committed to the high single-digit growth rate for this year? What will drive it? Is it just some pause ahead of the broader launch of the Skylake servers? If you could just give us some more color about why the growth rate is below trend right now and what will help it get back to trend later in the year and over the next few years. Sure, Vivek. So the simple answer is, absolutely, we're still committed to the high single-digit growth for the year. If you take a look at it, as Bob and I both mentioned in the call, when you take a look at Q1 comparatives, one, Q1 of last year was 14 weeks. This year, it's a normal 13 weeks. So you add that 1 extra week, that's a couple of percent that you're competing against on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, Q1 tends to be our lowest quarter in general, if you just look at our seasonality, in the year for overall revenue and output and growth in that business, in the data center business. And so as we look out and we see, as you said, the ramp of Skylake in the second half, as we see the normal seasonality, we are absolutely committed to that high single-digit growth rate for the rest of the year. That's helpful. And as my follow-up, the very rich mix in PCs, ASPs were up very strongly, how sustainable is that? And are you seeing any effect of competition from AMD's product launches? Sure, I'll start. Bob may want to jump in. Each quarter, we come in here and say we're a little concerned about the sustainability of those high ASPs, and we continue to have that. So we always forecast, if you take a look at the -- what we forecasted for the remainder of the year, we've forecasted a slight decline in ASPs as we move through the year. Now that said, we are continuing to improve our road map. We're continuing to pull in products. And the demand for those high-end, high-performance products from 2 in 1s, gaming, high-end workstations continues to grow faster than we are even able to project. So right now, we've forecasted a slight decline through the rest of the year. And we -- but we had strong demand for it in Q1. And I -- and we really believe that's a function of our products and our road map. From a competition standpoint, we're not seeing anything unusual right now as far as -- there's always some level of competition in this market, but -- and I'd tell you, for Q1 and our forecast for Q2, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary from what we normally see. Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian, is the -- in the -- with the ASPs being a little bit stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect full year revenue to be up $0.5 billion versus where we were 90 days ago. And I would say one of the contributors to that is kind of how we saw ASP trend in the first quarter of the year. Sure. So I'll start. First, I thought it would be good to give you a little background, right, why we do we come out and commit this now and kind of what's our thinking behind this. And part of it is we had good progress, brought down spending as a percent of revenue about 1% for 2016. We're a quarter in, and we're seeing good progress in our efforts along 2017 of taking it down another -- slightly more than 1% as we look at this year. And so we just really took a look at do we think we can maintain that progress and continue to drive efficiencies while driving growth. The growth we've expected is what we talked about in the analyst meeting back in February, which is that mid-single-digit type of growth for the overall company. And that's kind of where we're at from a growth perspective. And then the cost reduction and the efficiencies are driving the rest of it. Yes. And I would just say that the -- we kind of -- our focus is on growing the earnings performance for the company in the short, medium and long term. And what we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was, over the next 3 years, low single-digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and EPS growing faster than operating income. And that's the -- against that, we're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short, medium and long term. So the 30% target is consistent with kind of the 3-year plan, and we know that there's opportunities for us to be more efficient as we go forward. Yes. On the depreciation, we kind of implied in our guidance really no change on a depreciation through course of the year. And what that assumes is roughly $2.5 billion additional CapEx from memory in the year. In terms of profitability, for this year, when we talked to you at Analyst Day, Rob kind of laid out a plan where the Core 3D NAND would be profitable in the second half of the year, but our losses for the business would still be roughly in line with where we were in 2016. And that was a function of really 3 things: good performance on 3D NAND, continuing to ramp Dalian and continuing to invest in our Optane product or 3D XPoint. So those dynamics have us breaking even for the core business in the second half of the year, and we said that near the end of 2018, as a whole, the memory business would be profitable. And to the first quarter, growth was stronger than we expected, and performance out of our fab was even better than we expected. I just wanted to go back to the DCG growth and into your outlook in June, flat or slight growth overall, is your expectation the DCG would be similar to that? And then as you look out the whole year, you talked about cloud growth. I know tough compares with 18%. Just curious, you're -- since you've been shipping early to these customers, what would be the time frame that you would actually see some benefit from Skylake? Sure. So I'm not exactly sure I completely understood your slight growth. What we said is we're -- for DCG as a business, we're in the high single-digits growth rate. So we're absolutely committing to that. We talked about the 6% in Q1 and how, as we go through the year, we'll continue to grow. From the standpoint we've been sampling Skylake to the cloud guys now for some period of time, in fact, backed into latter half of last year, but you really don't see the ramp of Skylake in volume at any of the customers, whether it be the cloud guys or the rest of the enterprise and networking and all until the second half. That's really when the volume kicks in on the server side. And that's absolutely what we had forecasted, and there's no change in that forecast whatsoever. And then maybe if I could just ask, I know you don't break it out anymore but just your view on your modem product this year and next. And if you could also maybe opine about your foundry strategy and opportunities there. Sure. I can start with the modem, and Bob can talk about -- I'm not going to break it out financially. Bob can talk about -- jump on top of this. But for us, on our modem, it continues to gain momentum. We've talked about our one large customer, but we continue to get other interest in it. We are on schedule to bring our next-generation modem into production and customer qualifications this year. And really, looking out over time, we have the next several series of modems over the next few years from an LTE perspective, and then we're already working on and believe we're leading, if you looked at our output from MWC back in February as well, on the 5G side, which is both at the modem and back through the base station. And that, we believe, is really the differential that we're able to provide in the communication space, is in a space like 5G where the modem and the base station and backhaul is so integrated and so important, we're able to provide that end-to-end solution. From a foundry perspective, we continue to talk to several large customers, and as we're able to, we'll talk about volumes and launching of new products. But for right now, we're just saying we're continuing to invest and grow that business. Yes. And the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. As you'll remember, because our first launch client really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue growth for CCG will -- particularly because of modem, will have a relatively easy comp. So that's a contributor to growth in the first half. And as Brian said, we -- the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year. But given the products we have, we feel relatively good about where we are. So I'll start, Stacy. I think you have to take a look at where we're at. You're kind of asking a couple of questions. So first, from the growth standpoint, our position about investing and continuing to really drive growth is absolutely still just as strong as it was back in February at the Analyst Day. And I'd tell you, Q1 is a great example of that with year-over-year growth, another record quarter coming off a record year. And raising the year and forecasting another record year. So I feel very good about the investments we've made, both short term, medium term and long term, to drive that growth. That said, Bob and I have both been looking at now how do we do that and also at the same time, become more and more efficient. And what we've looked at now is that our performance and becoming more efficient in 2016 and taking about 1% out of our spending as a percent of revenue was very successful. We understand how we did that. As we looked at our first quarter performance and what we believe we can take out for the rest of 2017 is another percent of spending as a percent of revenue, slightly more actually. And then I think one of the things that Bob's really brought in as the CFO is new ways of thinking and new looks at how to continue that trend. And so taking 1% a year or so out of our spending as a percent of revenue is something we think we can go and accomplish while driving that growth. And that is the effort that we've spent over the last couple months really digging into those details. And that's why we felt like it was important we came out now and really said, yes, we are committing to that. We understand the details behind it. And we've got a history now that tells us we can say it with confidence. Yes, I would -- Stacy, we kind of provided a long-term outlook of 40% to 45% operating margin for DCG. Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earlier, high single digits and at the lower end of that range, of the 40% to 45%. In the first quarter, just to be clear, the 9-point drop in margin, 7 points of that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business, and we've indicated it will be first on 7-nanometer and a fast follow on 10-nanometer. As a result, it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our SG&A allocation. So 7 points of the 9 decline are simply a result of how we allocate costs to the business segments. I think in terms of going through the course of the year, the things that are going to change, as Brian indicated, we got strong product offering coming out in the second half of the year. We expect ASPs to improve as we go throughout the year. As you know, the first quarter is always the lower end of margin seasonality -- from a seasonal perspective. And we expect product costs to improve as we continue the transition from 22- to 14-nanometer. So it's in line with our long-term expectations, no change; our outlook for 2017, no change. The biggest fundamental driver to margin performance is simply the success of the data center business in terms of growing, in terms of being a bigger chunk of the overall business, in terms of being a beneficiary of leading-edge technology that bears 7 points impact because of the higher burden of our allocations on the business. So we feel good on where we are for the quarter and where we're positioned for the full year. Yes, that's true and that's reflected in our 40% to 45% and our improvement throughout the course of the year. Yes. I mean, our expectation is the operating margins for DCG will improve by quarter throughout the year. Again, it'll be a function of the normal seasonality of the profitability of the business. It will still bear a significant chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs. But you may remember that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated, I think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to second half. So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from lower costs. And then the third thing, higher -- yes, the real fundamentals of the business are higher ASPs with good product with an outstanding performance and getting better and better yields on our 14-nanometer product going through the fab will be benefits to the profitability of the business. The lowest point Q1 expectations, it'll grow each quarter throughout the year, and we would expect full year operating margins, despite higher absorption, higher burden from our indirect costs, at roughly 40% for the year. Sure, John. I'd tell you that the increase in CapEx that you're seeing this year is something that we kind of see as unique. But my guess is that we'll have to continue it for maybe 1 year more or so as we continue to build out that memory factory. But look, if you take a long-term view, I don't expect us to run these kinds of CapEx levels. I -- we'll always make good investments. So in a place like this where we think we have differential technology like 3D NAND and our Optane/3D XPoint, I'm going to look for ways to invest that have a positive NPV. But from this current view, we probably have another year and then probably go back down to what we'd consider a more normal rate. Sure. So we don't break out revenue on specific products like Phi, but Xeon Phi does continue to ramp and grow from a product standpoint. We have some additional products that we'll launch in the second half of this year around Xeon Phi from Knights Mill. And from an FPGA or other accelerators, we continue to get several of the large cloud providers, networking providers who are continuing to use our FPGAs. But again, we don't break out on a -- by customer standpoint. But we still are committed to our 6% roughly growth on the PSG business this year. Q1 was down just because of some unique -- there was some extra buying in the latter half of last year around some cloud. And the networking guys are typically down in the first quarter. So it hit its forecast, but it's down year-over-year. We think we'll recover that as we go through the rest of the year from an FPGA. And then as we go out through the second half of this year, the first of the products comes out in silicon from our Nirvana acquisition, which is another form of AI acceleration. We'll get that first silicon. We'll start to work with customers, and you'll see that come in 2018 as an additional accelerator adding to our full AI portfolio. The -- there's 2 dynamics on our total pool of indirect costs that are going on for the company. One is our SG&A indirect costs are coming down. Brian referred to that earlier about the progress we made on direct spending overall coming down another 1 point plus during the course of the year. And second, our R&D costs, particularly as it relates to Moore's Law for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, goes up a little bit. So during the course of the year, our overall costs will be roughly flat that we'll be allocating to the businesses. And DCG will get a larger portion of that than it has historically, roughly impacting the business by 7 points because of its bigger size and because of the decision to have it be a beneficiary of Moore's Law sooner than it has historically. So separate out again and remember we're making the large investments in Dalian. So from a pure 3D NAND perspective, we said it goes breakeven and beyond in the latter half of this year. So for next year, our standard NAND business will be profitable. 3D XPoint plus the Optane product is additional investments we're making. We said that that's in the second half of next year it goes to breakeven. And the overall business does as well. We haven't gotten any more granular than that for right now. Yes. I think first quarter, a little bit over, I'd characterize it primarily in the round. I think for first half, we're basically implying $10.6 billion of OpEx, and we're committed to our $20.5 billion for the first -- sorry, for the full year. So $10.6 billion in first half drops to $9.9 billion in the second half, and there's really 2 primary drivers to that. One is, as you alluded, the exit of McAfee will be roughly $300 million out from the first half run rate. And then secondly, just the completion of our previously announced restructuring programs will continue to bear fruit on lower OpEx in the second half of the year. So first half, $10.6 billion; second half, $9.9 billion; McAfee exit, continued execution and feel good about full year of $20.5 billion. And just a reminder, that $20.5 billion takes another roughly 1%, slightly more, out of our spending as a percent of revenue. So that's all baked in. I don't know if it's rounding or not. I'd say $0.5 billion of revenue upside at kind of roughly gross margin dynamics of the business will fall through an additional $0.05 of EPS. So we feel great about that. I think the dynamics of more the business is in the second half. ASPs will improve for data center. As Brian alluded earlier, we've assumed that ASPs will decline a little for the client business and the fast growth of memory and modem will have a negative mix impact on gross margin. So I think when we take that all together through the year, we felt a fairly consistent 63% with all those puts and takes throughout through the course of the year. And Q1 was where we expected; Q2, consistent with Q1 and full year. Just on the capacity that you're building in Dalian, can you say what percentage increase you're getting? Or is it directly correlated to the revenue growth that you're seeing in the memory group? Percentage. So a, yes, the growth in the memory business that goes through the rest of this year is largely driven by the ramp of the Dalian factory along with some assumptions around strong ASPs as demand continues to outpace supply the market in general. And so if you take a look from here on, in fact, 2017 by then, as we go out into 2018 and beyond, Dalian will continue to be the driver of growth of that business. I guess another way to phrase the question is what's the bit growth? Most other memory companies give a projection of what their bit growth is. Yes. I don't think we've actually ever given a bit growth. So that's not a public number. We can take a look at that for next quarter as to whether we want to start adding that to our normal distribution. But what we've always talked about is growth of the business from a profit or revenue standpoint and overall growth, partly because, remember, more and more of that business will become things like 3D XPoint/Optane, and bits will be a little bit different there, right? Not all bits are going to be created equal. That's a very differentiating technology. It's really got performance of DRAM-like devices with NAND non-volatility and pricing in between. And so those bits are a bit different than, say, typical NAND bits, and I wouldn't want to just lump those all into a standard number. So we need to think about how we'd really go and present this to you if you want to think about it from a bit standpoint. And that -- it's around 5% of the business this year, but as you go out into next year and beyond, it becomes a larger and larger percentage as we see more and more products, especially in the data centers, use the Optane technology. Right. And maybe if I could ask that question, too, of Optane. When would it transfer to China? We haven't talked about a transfer date to China yet. That hasn't been made public right now. Right now, Dalian is 3D NAND.","I guess, first question, in terms your targeted 30% OpEx ratio by 2020, would love to hear what kind of revenue assumptions you're making as part of hitting that. That's very helpful. I guess, as my follow-up, was hoping to take a look at memory and here, would love to hear from you as to how we should think about layering in depreciation from Dalian this year, next and when you would expect to turn a profit on the operating margin line. First, I wanted to ask again about this 30% spending target. You guys just had an Analyst Day like 2 months ago. It seems like something that probably should have been talked about then. So what's changed in the last 2 months that means you need to roll the target out on today's call? And how should I try to reconcile that target with some of your other commentary at the Analyst Day where you were fairly gung ho about the need to invest to fund growth? Got it. For my follow-up, I'd like to ask about DCG margins. So they were 35% this quarter. It doesn't sound like there was anything structural like the warranty charge that hit last quarter. This sounds like the drivers around allocation and everything else we've discussed. But it's still quite a bit lower than I think most would have expected. How should we think about that margin profile trending through the year as the Skylake parts ramp? And do you think, for the full year, you'll actually be within the data center margin targets that you provided at the Analyst Day? But those allocation charges aren't going to go away anytime soon. It sounds like they're going to hang around for a while if you're talking about 10 and the 7-nanometer. Bob, maybe just a follow-on to Stacy's question, just some clarification around the allocation charges. The 7 points in March, does that represent a peak? Or do we run into a situation where as absolute costs for 7 and 10 go up throughout the year, you could see op margins in DCG continue to be down just because the percent doesn't change but the dollars are going up? And that clarification's helpful. And then, Brian, as my follow-up, one of the strengths of your model is just the free cash flow that you can generate, which enables you to reinvest organically back in the business. And you're clearly doing it this year on the CapEx front with CapEx up over 20% year-over-year. I guess what I'm trying to understand is should we be thinking of CapEx this year as sort of the new norm with rising capital intensity, investments in the memory business, maybe optionality around foundry? Or is the $12 billion this year sort of something that we should think about as being an above trend or particularly high spending year? Any color on that would be helpful. Can you give us some idea within data center of what revenues you're currently seeing from Xeon Phi? And also, you mentioned acceleration services at Alibaba. Can you fill us in on any other key customers adopting Xeon Phi, FPGAs or any of your other accelerators? I just wanted to clarify your answer to John's question. So in terms of the $300 million year-over-year burden on DCG operating margin that's due to the cost allocation, is that sort of a fixed number going forward? Or does that absolute number get better through the year? And then as a follow-up, I -- so I just wanted to clarify. So the NSG, so you're expecting to still lose money into the first half of next year. And is that what you're saying? Or are you saying that for the entirety of the year next year you'll be profitable? Wanted to ask the first one on the OpEx side of things, and I applaud the 30% target. It's good to see that commitment. But I wanted to focus a little bit more in the near term. In the first quarter, it was about $100 million above what you had guided. In the second quarter, it's a bit above what I expected, too, especially given McAfee. So could you give us a little color on why it was a little bit higher in the first quarter and where we are in the restructuring benefits and the McAfee benefits? If you can do anything to size either of those in the near term, that will be helpful. I guess my follow-up then switches to the gross margin side of things. It's staying solid, and I might be at the risk of a rounding error in this question as well. But considering that you raised your revenues and ASPs were a big portion of that, usually that's a pretty good follow-through. So the fact that you're keeping the gross margin guide for the year flat at 63%, are there any incremental offsets to the goodness that the revenue and the ASPs would generate? Or is it in fact just rounding? Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us. Crystal, please go ahead and wrap up the call.

INTC,Q4 2016,2520,5169,1705,"Thank you, Janelle, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's fourth-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you have not received both documents, they are available on our investor website, INTC.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on INTC.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation. And finally, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be hosting our annual investor meeting, here at our Santa Clara headquarters, on Thursday, February 9. If you have any questions about the event or logistics, please contact Investor Relations. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. Thanks, Mark. I'd like to cover three things with you today before handing off to Bob: a brief review of our results for the year, an update on the transformation of the Company, and a look ahead at 2017 and Intel's future. First, the review of our results. Q4 was a strong finish to a record year in which we increased revenue 7% and net income 9%. The Client Computing Group, Data Center Group, Internet of Things, and Intel Security all grew in 2016, with DCG and IoTG setting full-year revenue and volume records. The acquisition of Altera added 3 percentage points to our overall growth rate. In the Data Center, cloud service provider revenue grew 24%, while enterprise revenue was down 3% for the full year. Additionally, we are very excited that Com Service Provider revenue grew 19%. And across all of our customer categories, adjacency revenue grew an incredible 21%, with strength in ethernet controllers, Omni-Path fabric controllers and switches, and network ASICs. IoT revenue was up 15% for the full year, driven by strength in the video, retail, and industrial segment. In Q4, we launched new Apollo Lake and Kaby Lake product, and we won key designs in automotive and video. Our Memory business finished the year with record quarterly revenue, while full-year revenue was down 1%. This was an investment year for the memory business, but NSG operating margins improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter. We're now shipping 3D NAND from our Fab68, and we just qualified our first 3D cross point-based Optane SSD, which we expect to ship for revenue in the first quarter. And our 3D cross point memory DIMMs are sampled to Data Center customers. The Client Computing business achieved impressive results, driven by strong execution and higher ASPs, as customers bought a richer mix of Intel Core product. This was also a breakout year for CCG's wireless communications product line. Our 7360 LTE modem ramped into high volume and we shipped record Wi-Fi units. I'm very proud of the Client Computing business, and what this team has delivered in 2016. Our strategy of delivering consistent product leadership, segmentation, and differentiation paid off. We achieved record i7 units, and overall core mix in 2016. And Client Computing revenue was up 2% for the year, despite the declining PC market. The Programmable Solutions Group was up about 7% on a non-GAAP basis over Altera's 2015 results. PSG saw strength across many segments, with particular strength in compute and storage. The Programmable Solutions business sampled the industry's first, and only, 14-nanometer FPGAs this year, known as Stratix 10. This product line has the largest demand pipeline in Altera's history. The integration of Altera into Intel was an important milestone in what was a transformative year for Intel. This team did a great job of meeting integration objectives, while continuing to deliver new products and grow the business. In 2016, we took other important, and in some cases difficult, steps to position  the Company for future success, improve the alignment of our resources to our strategy, and accelerate our transformation to the company that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Our restructuring initiative focused on our investments on the product and technologies that will fuel our growth. And that work, combined with improvements in 14-nanometer costs, drove a 30% operating margin improvement in our Client business. Our decision to establish McAfee as a separate, independent company was another transformative move. This transaction will give McAfee the flexibility to invest independently, tighten our focus, and allow Intel to share in McAfee's future success as the market demand for world-class security product continues to grow. And finally, looking ahead to 2017 at Intel's future, I am confident we are making the right investments to compete and win, not only in the segments where Intel is strong today, but also in new areas that are poised for growth driven by the emerging flood of data. By 2020, the average person will generate about 1.5 gigabytes of data per day, while smart and connected devices of the future will produce data at many times that rate. Autonomous cars, for example, will generate about 4,000 gigabytes of data each day. The resulting explosion of data is creating tremendous opportunity. But data alone isn't valuable. It is the transmission, aggregation, and analysis of the data that results in value and impact. Intel will play a central role in those steps because our products are key to turning raw data into high-value insight and information. Our investments in advanced research and development are making this all possible, while significantly expanding our TAM at the same time. These investments are creating opportunities in segments from autonomous driving, where we are uniquely positioned to be the compute engine in the vehicle and the data center; to 5G where we are building on our momentum in 4G to establish leadership; to artificial intelligence, where we are providing the industry's most complete range of products to accelerate all AI solutions, from the edge to the data center. We are already seeing signs of progress. In autonomous driving, we are winning key designs like BMW, Delphi, and Baidu. In 5G, we are leading in the definition of standards, prototyping, and field trial. Our Network business saw strong growth as infrastructure moved to Intel architecture in anticipation of 5G. Our design wins and network virtualization innovation position us for leadership share in the wireless access market. Other proof points of our progress include important partnerships with AT&T, SK Telecom, Korea Telecom, and Verizon, and the announcement earlier this month of the industry's first global 5G modem. Finally, in artificial intelligence, we believe we have the industry's strongest product portfolio. Intel processors power well over 90% of servers deployed to support machine-learning workload, and we are winning the vast majority of AI solution, based on strong product performance and customer value. Wrapping things up, I am very pleased with Intel's performance in 2016. We have important work to do in 2017, as we continue to transfer the Company but the progress we have made leaves me increasingly confident in Intel's growth and Intel's future. And with that, I will hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was an outstanding quarter. Revenue was up 10%, operating income was up 11%, and EPS was up 4% year over year. Revenue set an all-time record at $16.4 billion, and operating income was $4.9 billion. Fourth-quarter operating margin was 30%, flat year over year. Gross margin, at 63%, was down 2 points, primarily driven by a couple of one-time events related to product warranty cost, and long-term IP agreements. Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, up 4% year over year, and down 2 points as a percent of revenue. Earnings per share of $0.79 was up $0.03 from a year ago. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $9.1 billion, up 4% year over year. During the fourth quarter, the worldwide PC supply chain remained healthy, and we saw some inventory burn during the quarter. Client ASPs were up 7% year over year, and core mix was at an all-time high as a result of the success of our segmentation strategies, and strength in gaming and high-end systems. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating profit growing 30% from a year ago, as the business continues to benefit from lower spending, richer product mix, and continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit costs. The Data Center Group had record revenue of $4.7 billion, up 8% year over year. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see robust growth in the cloud and com service provider segments of the business, which both grew approximately 30% year over year, partially offset by a 7% decline in the enterprise and government segment over the same horizon. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.9 billion, down 14% year over year. Operating margin was impacted by the two one-time items I referred to earlier, and the ramp of 14 nanometer on our server products, which we expect to generate continued cost improvements over time. Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $726 million, growing 16% year over year, driven by strength in both retail and industrial segment. Operating profit for the business was $182 million, up 37% year over year. Our Memory business had a record revenue of $816 million, up 25% year over year, with strong demand for Data Center SSD solutions, with demand signals outpacing supply. We have made great progress ramping Fab68, with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectation. This segment had an operating loss of $91 million, largely driven by cost associated with 3D cross point, and start-up costs for our memory capacity. The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $420 million, and operating profit was $80 million. Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $550 million, and operating profit of $103 million. Turning to the full-year 2016, revenue grew 7%, operating margin grew 11%, and EPS grew 9%. Operating margin percent improved by 1 point, while gross margin was approximately 63%, flat to 2015. Spending was $21 billion, or 35.4% of revenue, down 1 point from 2015, primarily from the restructuring programs we began earlier in the year. Operating profit for the year was $16.5 billion. Earnings per share for the year was $2.72, up $0.23 from the prior year. In 2016, the business generated record cash from operations of $21.8 billion. We purchased $9.6 billion in capital assets, paid $4.9 billion in dividends, and repurchased about $2.6 billion of stock. Total cash balance was $17.1 billion, down $8.2 billion. Total debt was $25.3 billion. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is approximately negative  $2.3 billion. Now let me turn to guidance. First, some context. First, our guidance assumes a stable macroeconomic environment, but we have taken a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third parties, particularly in our outlook for the emerging markets including Russia, China, and Latin America. Second, for the Data Center, we continue to expect similar growth rates in the cloud and com segment, but we are not expecting an improvement in enterprise. This gets us to an expectation of high-single-digit growth in the Data Center business. Third, as a reminder, we have one less week as a result of the inclusion of an extra work week in 2016. And last, we have assumed the Intel Security transaction will close in Q2, and our full-year guidance reflects one full quarter of the Group's consolidated results. We have lots of work to do to close this out, and in the event the close happens at the end of the second quarter, we would update our full-year guidance by approximately an additional $500 million of revenue, and $100 million of operating income. As we look forward to the first quarter of 2017, we are forecasting a midpoint of the revenue range at $14.8 billion, up 7% year over year, and down from the fourth quarter. This is at the lower end of our seasonal range and reflects an expectation of lower Core brand mix, and ASP coming off a strong holiday-selling period for gaming and other premium PC systems. For the first quarter, we expect operating margin percent to increase 4 points, year over year, gross margins to be flat at approximately 63%, and spending to be $5.3 billion, down 1%. We expect EPS to be approximately $0.65, up 20% year over year. Turning to the full-year 2017, we are expecting revenue to be roughly flat. Revenue is expected to grow in the low-single digits, after excluding the Intel Security Group from both years. We expect operating margin percent to be up 1 point year over year, with flat gross margins, and direct spending as a percent of revenue, down 1 point versus 2016. Let me provide a bit more detail on our year-over-year direct spending. Our restructuring plans are on track, including reducing our headcount by approximately 15,000 heads and generating gross savings of $1.6 billion. We are reallocating investments from CCG to higher growth segments, and are continuing to invest in areas that extend our leadership position in Moore's Law, and expand TAM opportunities, such as memory and autonomous driving. We anticipate the net benefit of these actions to result in an additional point of improvement in direct spending as a percent of revenue, in 2017. We expect EPS of approximately $2.80, up 3% year over year. In 2016, we had a fairly significant gain from our ICAP Portfolio. Our 2017 guidance assumes that we'll have gains roughly in line with 2016 levels. The capital spending forecast for 2017 is $12 billion, up $2.5 billion from 2016, as we continue to ramp our memory capacity. In closing, 2016 started out slow but finished strong. Our CCG business is focused and executing extremely well in a declining market, and provides the scale that is required to advance Moore's Law, generates significant cash flows, and enables investments for growth. Our growth-oriented businesses were up 15% collectively, as we continue to transform the Company from PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud. We are excited about our plans for 2017 as we continue with our transformation, and we look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in February. With that let me turn it over, back to Mark. Okay. Thank you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Janelle, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","Yes, Chris, the CCG performance -- a couple dynamics that are driving the kind of record margins. One, higher ASPs on the strong mix that Brian referred to. Secondly, real strong unit cost. It has been on 14nm for a while, so we expect that to continue. And then, constrained investments in the CCG business as we focus more on investing heavier in the higher growth businesses. Real good performance, and those are the dynamics we are expecting in 2017. On the DCG front, good in Q4 and then project forward. Nice ASP performance in the quarter, as we migrate from Haswell to Broadwell, and as we think about Skylake in 2017, we expect that to continue. Unit costs in DCG is a little bit higher, because we are coming off great unit cost performance on 22nm, but as we migrate to 14nm. In the earlier stages of that cycle, unit costs are a little bit higher. And then we are increasing our investments in DCG on a year-over-year basis. So, dynamics are relatively good. The one, I referred to it a little earlier, but in terms of Q4, we had a couple one-time items that really weighed on the profitability or operating margins of DCG that we think are well-bounded, and do not expect to continue into 2017. And just quickly, one we entered in a long-term cross-license agreement and patent-purchase agreement particularly in the com space in the quarter. And DCG was impacted by a portion of that cost in the quarter. But secondly, and a little more significant, we were observing a product quality issue in the fourth quarter. We had slightly higher expected failure rates under certain use and time constraints, and we established a reserve to deal with that. We think we have it relatively well-bounded with a minor design fix that we are working with our client to resolve. So those two, one-timers in the fourth quarter weighed on DCG margins, and we do not expect that to continue in 2017. This is Brian, I can start, and then Bob can add in. If you take a look-- Bob mentioned in his portion of the talk, of, hey, we have taken a slightly more conservative view of 2017 than third parties for what we see the overall PC unit market as. And we had extremely strong, I mean, record Core i7s, just record Core mix in the fourth quarter, that as we look at Q1 and we look at 2017, we've factored a little bit of caution into that as well. Those two things put us in the PC market at a unit level in the mid-single-digit decline. That is better if you went back a year ago we were in the high single-digit. Depending on how you looked at it, and where you counted some the 2-in-1 devices. So it is starting to get better, but I don't think we are back at a zero unit or positive unit. But as Bob said, what we have been really focusing on in that space is how do you make money? How do you sell up? How do you do better business performance in that kind of market? And we are comfortable that we can continue that into 2017. Chris, the only thing I would add is, we think it -- as Brian said, our outlook is a little more conservative than the third parties. And, our view is, that is probably the right posture, and the right caution to have as we go into the year. Obviously, the team has done a great job in adjusting its cost structure for a more cautious outlook, and then, we will see how it plays out during the course of the year. Thank you. Let me start, and then, again,  Bob can jump in on this one. As we said, we took a look at the 2017 view on Enterprise to be relatively equivalent to what we saw in 2016. Which says that Enterprise continues to decline. I think that is certainly some of that is that it's moving to a public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than, I think, we expected. It also has been a little bit slow about developing private clouds, and we are working with several partners like Microsoft Azure and others, around the private cloud segments, as well, for the Enterprise. But if you take a look at the long-term, we still see this as the growth engine and still getting into that double-digit regime. Remember, for us, Enterprise is now less than 50% of our overall Data Center business. And areas that are growing even faster, or as fast as cloud in most cases, are the networking and storage space, which we have very low market share in still, and it is a great opportunity for us. And in the emerging areas like Silicon Photonics, Omni-Path fabric, Rack Scale Design and 3D Xpoint. And those areas are really, what we've always forecasted to be the growth engine of the Data Center group as we exit and go towards the back half of this decade. So, for us,  our view is, this is a -- anytime you're going through a market transition, you're not going to get the cloud-to-Enterprise mix perfect. And this is an anomaly right now, that we've forecasted, we think, accurately and adjusted for it the way it is. But our long-term growth was actually based on other factors, and we are still very confident in those growth areas. I don't know if Bob wants to add -- Nope, I think you -- that's perfect. Nothing to add. Thanks. Sure. Yes. It's mostly, if not in almost every case, all mix shift. And it's, our customers buying up. A great example was the K SKUs. The Enthusiasts, the 10 Core Systems that we've put out there -- they far and away exceeded our original sales forecast. So people are out there buying 10 Core gaming systems. So we do believe that market -- that Enthusiast market will continue. We factored a little bit more caution into this, as we go into the 2017 and the first quarter. Some of that seasonality, holiday, people tend to by a lot of gaming systems. And some of it is just how much more can people buy up? And so, how much more growth in ASP can we see? But, we don't see a decline or anything of the average ASPs. And, the only thing I would add is, as we think about the full-year. The second-half comps get a little tougher on ASP, because of the strong ASP performance throughout the course of 2016. So, that's probably the only dynamic that I would add. Sure I'll let Bob talk about the McAfee financials and how that affects OpEx. It gets a little complex with Q1 -- end of Q1 target there. But let's just talk about it in general. What we've always said, is that we were going to go through the program that we went through at the middle of last year, which we called [ACT] just  continued through the end of last year, 2016 and we said would be completed about the middle of 2017. We always said there would be some mix between taking that to the bottom line, and reinvesting it in those growth areas. And so, as we have done acquisitions like Nervana, for artificial intelligence, we want to invest in those businesses now, bring them onto our silicon, integrate them into our software stack. And so, we are going to make those kinds of investments in key areas. We said the key areas around Data Center in general, we have Rack Scale Design, we have 3D Xpoint, we have artificial intelligence, around IoT, and we are making a big bets around autonomous driving. And so, you see us making the investment in HERE -- the investments with BMW. And that's really, when you take a look at autonomous driving, and why are we doing that? It is around Data and Data Centers, again. Remember, every one of those high-definition maps is going to require data centers, they are going to require small data centers at the edge. So, it's all around, are we understanding and managing how data is going to flow in that system? And then memory itself. And we are going to go make those investments around 3D Xpoint, and really bring that and 3D NAND to market in a big way. And so we will balance between those, and I think you will see some mix of bringing it to the bottom line. But, if I can invest, and think I can turn that into additional profitability in the future, I'm going to go do that. The only thing I would add, is just to maybe make it a little simple for people, as we look at our full-year guidance that we gave, and then we extract out three-quarters of McAfee. At the macro level, we are looking at low-single-digit growth, and mid-single-digit EPS growth. So, that is kind of the year-on-year, apples-to-apples dynamic. On direct spending itself, we will be down roughly -- our guidance implies we'll be down roughly $0.5 billion year-on-year. And that is just a function of three things; one, continued benefits from the restructuring actions that we took in 2016 and continued to execute on in the first half in 2017; secondly, obviously the direct spend of McAfee kind of goes away; and third, as Brian mentioned,  during this transformation, we continued to make investments in the higher-growth businesses. We will continue to invest in 5G and ADAS, and then we will continue to invest in Moore's Law as we bring 10nm to life in 2017, and continue to invest in 7nm. So net-net, the implications of all that for direct spending was 1 point down, as a percentage of revenue in 2016, and another point down, as a percentage of revenue in 2017. And then the only thing I would add, is in terms of the milestones that we employ during the course of the year, for these big bets, we'll continue to build milestones in to make sure those bets that we are making are turning out in the medium- and long-term, the way we expect. Sure. I would tell you that we always look at this environment and say, there is going to be a competitive risk in the environment. And we are always focused on, really, our own product roadmap and making sure we have the highest-performance product. So, when we look at 2017, we still believe that our product roadmap is truly the best ever it's been. And, as we look at the Kaby Lake, and as it really ramps up through 2017, where it came out, really, just at the end of 2016, and now we'll ram with many more SKUs and higher-performance products as we go into 2017. And then, we showed at CES, the first working 10nm Cannonlake product, which we are still planning to ship by the end of this year, and really ramp into 2018. We still believe that our roadmap and our leadership will continue to give us the performance the customers want and desire. And so, that did not necessarily factor into that more cautious forecast. That forecast was really much more a function of where we think the PC market really is over all. First, in essence, the guidance year-on-year doesn't really anticipate any dramatic change in our share count. I think philosophically, our approach is to offset dilution from our comp-base programs, so all else equal, share count relatively flat year-on-year. I think, the one thing worth noting is -- in our ICAP Portfolio in 2016, we had a fairly significant gain, and what I indicated in the prepared remarks is we expect, roughly in 2017, that gain to be inline with what 2016 generated. I think in terms of implied share count in our guidance, it is essentially flat year on year. Yes, in terms of the type of cost, maybe two-fold. Yes, people and yes, technology/Moore's law, at the macro level and that expresses itself in higher depreciation year-on-year. In our guide, our depreciation is up quite a bit, and a portion that will flow through direct spending. Again, on a more macro basis, at the risk of maybe repeating myself, we are investing more in DCG, and in particular, bringing some of these adjacent products that Brian referred to, to market. We continue to invest in memory, and particularly in the 3D Xpoint product, and we continue to invest in IoT. So those three businesses are getting a disproportionate share of the investment, because those are the businesses that we have seen really strong growth in 2016, and we are counting on continued growth in 2017. The second area, and again, we talked about this a little bit, but we see real opportunities in autonomous driving that play to our strengths and our capabilities. And we will -- we are making step function increase in our investments to position ourselves very well for that industry, and that market, as it evolves. And then again, third, 7nm, a technology investment, and the spend associated with building a new pilot line in 2017, is also an additional investment. So we are executing on our restructuring programs. It was -- we took out roughly -- we made the tough decisions in 2016 that resulted in roughly 11,000 fewer people as a result of our restructuring program. We are not quite done, but I would say we are on track. At the same time we are making investments both in technology and people, to strengthen and enhance our competitive position in the areas that we see as real opportunities for us. The only thing I would add, Stacy, as more of a blunt answer to your question, is if you take a look at the areas that we are talking about, in almost every case, these are new and expanding TAMs for us. So, even look at the places where we're going in the Data Center, and this is my point earlier about Enterprise versus cloud. Enterprise is now less than 50% of our total makeup for the Data Center group. And the cloud is growing great, and that will continue, but if you look at the areas -- the majority of the rest of the growth for the rest of this decade, in the Data Center alone, it's networking and storage where we have very low market share today. But we are bringing things like software defined networking, and NFV to those. And so that is growing and expanding TAM, as those markets move to Intel architecture. And then it is, going into Rack Scale Design, Omni-Path fabric, Silicon Photonic, those are all, again, new either nascent or expanding TAMs for us. Autonomous cars and the IoT space are new and expanding TAMs for us. 5G is a TAM that is brand-new that will be really being built out over the rest of this decade. And then memory -- if you look at the large part of the investment we are making, it's 3D Xpoint, which really rearchitects memory and storage, and will create a new market in our mind. And we believe we are unique in having that technology. So to me, when I look at the investment, they are all focused around data, they're all in support of how the Data Center ecosystem works, and they are all in either expanding or new TAMs for Intel. And so that is why I see the growth in those areas. It is not just enhancing the technologies that we already have. We will do that, but the new investments are really focused on the new areas. Thanks, Stacy. I will let Bob start with this, and then I will come in and talk a little bit about the macro view of this. Two dynamics in the fourth quarter where we had higher ASPs. One, the continued transition from Haswell to Broadwell is helpful, and then as we project forward,  the next transition is Skylake -- we believe will be helpful as well. So those dynamics where we're delivering better performance for our customers, we are able to capture some of that in ASPs. And we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter. And secondly, in the coms and network space, which is a share-gain opportunity for us in DSG, getting those clients to move up the stack in terms of the high-performance server CPUs is the second dynamic. Both of which we think are helpful as we exit 2016, and go into 2017. Yes the only thing I would add, John, is, we'll as we go back into the second half of this year; do the Skylake transition. And that is a technology that will increase performance, and a performance per cost to our customers -- one of the largest improvement in a long time, if not ever, on the Data Center. So, we expect -- typically when that happens people see the value in that and they tend to buy up. They tend to buy the better SKUs. To my view, this trend of higher mix should continue. Sure. Let's talk about memory in kind of a big picture, John, and then we can -- I'll let Bob talk a little bit about how the CapEx weighs, and what our view of CapEx is in this space. But, we are in this space for one reason. Because, I understand it is a cyclical business, that tends to be fairly difficult from a price-capacity standpoint. But, we believe we are coming at it with two, very unique technologies. Our 3D NAND technology has some of the best performance and best cost in the market. Our current version of 3D NAND has a 15% price -- or cost value over the competition, and our next version, second-generation has even a higher, when you look at it on a density basis. And so, we believe we are going to be able to bring differential cost and performance in 3D NAND that will give us a unique position. And that combined with our knowledge of the Data Center should allow us to really provide compelling products for Data Center SSDs. 3D Xpoint is very different in that it's a unique technology that bridges between memory and storage. And, we believe it can rearchitect how big data applications, artificial intelligence applications where you want large amounts of data being brought up as close to the compute as you can, will really transform, not only the architecture of those systems but the performance of those systems. And we have demonstrated on stage, even on client systems using these types of SSDs, on a equal price, you can get 5x to 7x performance improvement using 3D Xpoint as a large memory storage, kind of, combination. So we are investing, surely because we believe we have this differential technology, and that is why we are in this business. I think, if I did not have that differential, I'm not sure it is a business that Intel would necessarily be in. Right? But with that leadership, and we believe we could sustain that leadership. We believe it is a good business and a good investment. I'll have Bob talk about how long and how we view the capital. So yes, John. The CapEx dynamic, first kind of at the macro level, up $2.5 billion year-on-year, driven by two things. One, memory, obviously. But also bringing10nm capacity online. If I just go down a level to memory. Roughly, $1.6 billion CapEx in 2016. Expectation is it will be roughly $2.5 billion in 2017, as we bring the incremental capacity online. Then as we look at memory specifically, in 2018 we think it begins to drop off a little bit, as we focus that capacity on 3D NAND and increasingly 3D Xpoint. Thank you. Well, we are always open for business in foundry. And we are always interested -- remember we said our foundry strategy was really to be on the leading edge. So, because we can get paid for our technology, and it really allows us to use our unique differentiation in that space. Beyond that, I would just tell you we have always been proud. It is not a new transition or new strategy for Intel. We have always been roughly between, a little more than half to two-thirds of our capacity in the US. We are the second largest exporter in the US. And we are proud of that position. But other than that, there is no real shift in our strategy right now. So let me start, and then we can see. I think our view is that Enterprise will continue to decline. A lot of that is those workloads moving to the cloud. It will get to a point where it starts to stabilize and those -- because there are still things that -- workloads that will want to be in a private cloud. At the same time, we believe as the world becomes connected, cloud will grow at a much faster rate. And, I made a point in the prepared remarks, where if you look at the cloud of today, seeing mostly based on people -- the average person will generate about 1.5 GB of data a day. An autonomous car, when those things start hitting the road, and we've  started to build these Data Centers for some of the trials we're working with. And you are talking about petabytes of data that you are having to deal with, and 4,000 GB a day off the average autonomous car. You put a couple of those on the road, and you need petabytes of storage to handle that. So we do believe that the cloud will move at a faster rate as these connected devices become, basically, more available. That said, the cloud is becoming bigger than Enterprise. We said Enterprise is now less than 50%. And we believe the other areas that will grow, networking and storage, the adjacencies like Omni-Path fabric, Silicon Photonics, Rack Scale Design, which we're working with our partners on, it really lowers the cost of the system and rearchitects how the Rack is laid out. And 3D Xpoint should dramatically -- that will drive the growth for us, as we go through the rest of this decade. We believe when you add those up together, this thing will go back to double digits. Went exactly that is? Because it's pretty hard -- we're trying to grow these new nascent areas, and manage the decline of Enterprise. It's going to be hard to call exactly when. But we do still have a strong belief, and we believe the products are very compelling, that these will drive us to double-digit growth long-term. The only thing I would add, Brian, is on like-for-like product, ASPs have a tendency to be lower to the cloud service providers, but at the same time the cloud service providers really value performance. And in terms of the mix of their products, they will value performance in the higher-end products more than maybe Enterprise as a whole. I think, historically, the philosophy around first and foremost, investing in -- organically in our capabilities has always been the first priority. That will be the same. Secondly, we will continue to look at M&A that will strengthen our capabilities so that is no different than the past. Third, in terms of capital returns, our expectation has been, and I think will continue to think it this way going forward as it relates to dividend, grow it in line with non-GAAP earnings. And have it be roughly 40% of the free cash flow for the Company -- those change around the margins over time depending on the CapEx intensity of the business. But I don't expect that to change, and we will continue to look at how we move the dividend in line with that philosophy. As I said earlier, in terms of the more holistic capital returns bucket, we will continue to offset dilution, which I think is pretty consistent with what we have done in the past. And then third, we have a great balance sheet. And I do think that, opportunistically, when it makes sense, reducing our outstanding float is an opportunity we have as we get closer to the net-cash zero position that we have been tracking towards over the last 12 months since the Altera acquisition. So, philosophically no dramatic change. Dividend in line with non-GAAP earnings growth. But trying to stay in that roughly 40% free cash flow world. And maybe if opportunities present itself, be opportunistic in share counts without limiting our financial flexibility relative to the things that matter most, which is strengthening our business. Thank you. Sure, So if you take a look at it -- as I said, this is a cyclical market. If you take a look at 2016, it started out with an oversupply. Came into the back half of the year with an under-supply, really, of capacity. We are entering 2017 with a continued tightness in supply. That makes pricing stable to better. So, we expect that, at least, right now the estimates are through the first half. It's pretty hard to project out to the second half, and so we have kind of kept the second half relatively calm and cautious. If you take a look at 3D Xpoint, as we said we've qualified. We've started to ship DIMM samples to the big cloud service guys. Those are targeted for 2018 revenue shipment. On an SSD basis, we will start shipping for revenue this quarter. And, if you take a look at the full year, I think the estimate is, it's around 10% of our total revenue is 3D Xpoint. And that will be -- it could take off and it could be a little more than that. It could take a little while to qualify some things if it's a little off. But you should think it is around 10% of the revenue. And really, ramping much more into 2018. What we are proud of, is you get past that first hurdle of getting the first one to production ready, and starting to ship samples to the cloud guys, and actually getting ready to start shipping SSDs for revenue to the client devices and all that. We are pretty excited about just getting to that point right now with 3D Xpoint. The full-year for memory was down 1%, 2016 over 2015. But the momentum that you saw is that supply chain dynamic that Brian highlighted changed. And as we began to scale our own capabilities, you saw the strong exit growth of 25% in the fourth quarter. And so with that going into 2017, we feel pretty good about that growth rate in the fourth quarter, as we enter the new year. So, let's talk about that. If I look at 2016, as we showed, we had about 7% growth over what Altera had in 2015. If you take a look at it, there is a couple of big segments that are driving that, Telco, Data Center, and we are starting to see -- and in the networking space as well. Those a kind of the big three segments. And we started to see as we went through, especially the back of the year, a good connection between our ability to go in, and we are better together,  with Xeon and the FPGA, as we go into that networking space. Again, as our footprint grows in networking and storage, I think it also gives us an ability to continue to bring both products to those markets. So, we think in 2016, we actually gained share relative to the competition. As we look out into 2017, we forecasted again, above market growth from what we understand, as a current estimate. And we believe we will gain a little bit of share, again, in 2017. And, remember these markets are slow-moving. You don't grow 10% share instantly, because of design cycles and design conversions are relatively difficult. It is again driven by Data Center, Networking, and the telco industry. And with Stratix 10, as we said, largest design enablement in the history of Altera, so we are really excited. We believe it brings a performance and a cost to our customers, that is truly industry-leading and shifting.  And, so we are very comfortable -- or confident in that, but again that will really start to shift in the second half of 2017. And so, I think that will really be driving growth in 2018. And really if you think about these design cycles, that product will really continue to drive growth for probably the next three years, plus, just because these cycles are fairly long. Thank you. Yes The two tailwinds on the year-on-year are flat, ASPs being a little better, and we anticipate that more on the DCG side. Secondly, unit cost being a little bit better, and we anticipate that more on the CCG side. And again, as I mentioned earlier, for DCG as we transition more from 22nm to 14nm, all else equal, that will be a little bit of a headwind in the early stages of yield for server on 14nm. The headwinds, particularly, are strong growth coming from memory and modem. So those two dynamics, themselves: good growth, increasing profitability, good earnings, however, they are at a lower margin so the mix dynamic of those are real on a year-over-year basis. So, good ASP, good unit cost, but mix is a challenge. And then year-on-year factory ramp, 10nm and memory are a headwind for the full year, but it gets a little bit better in the second half. The dynamic to first-half, second-half -- it gets a little bit better in the second half. I think the dynamics of the $3 billion, the intention is that roughly $1 billion comes in line at time of transaction. And that we will provide dollar financing in the early stages. So we will only get roughly $1 billion upfront. In terms of then, just the net debt position during the course of the year, you can assume that we have some maturities in 2015 -- sorry 2017 that we will take out. And we believe by the end of the year, given those dynamics, we will be closer to a net-cash zero position. In terms of that, and that gives us a much stronger balance sheet, and how we think about that. We will continue, as I said earlier, invest in business, return capital to shareholders, and opportunistically, whether it is reducing outstanding float -- that's one that we'll continue to look at and be opportunistic as opportunities present themselves.","Hey, thanks, guys. Just digging out on the segments. The CCG operating margins were, I think, the highest in the last few years. DCG was kind of the lowest in the last few years. Can you talk about the trend in operating margins for those two segments, for this year, given the guidance? Great, thank you. Do I get a follow-up? Yes, please go ahead, Chris. Maybe just expand on the PC market. What do you see driving the strength here? How sustainable is it? Any thoughts on PC unit growth for this year? Great, thanks guys. Nice quarter. Great. Thank you. I wonder if I could ask about the DCG commentary of being up high-single digits. Obviously, that is a little more conservative than the longer-term numbers you had talked about. And I guess as you think about that, is there an element of the cloud spending that you think is causing the Enterprise to be weaker? Or maybe some give us the qualitative underpinnings for that change? Great. Thank you for that. That's great. And then separately, on the PC market. The ASP growth that you guys saw over the course of 2016, is that strictly mix shift and strength in the higher-end segments as you've been talking about? And any thoughts on your ability to continue that price momentum over the course of this year. Great. Thank you, very much. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one on OpEx, and it's more of a conceptual one for you, Brian. On flat revenues it is great to see some OpEx leverage on there, but I think some people are hoping for a little bit more as you had the restructuring only halfway done, and then the McAfee sale that's pending. So, can you talk conceptually about how you balance the desire to reinvest versus the desire to get the profitability up to your long-term targets? That's very helpful. I guess as my follow-up -- you talked about the ASPs in answering a prior question, I wondered about the competitive intensity in the PC market. You're taking a more conservative tack than the third-party vendors are forecasting, but your primary x86 competitor's coming out with the new architecture for the first time in many years. So I wonder whether it is on the ASP, or the unit, or the market share side, how you are factoring that into your forecast for the year? Great. Thank you guys. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question, first, on the guidance for next year. Unless I am doing the math wrong, to get to $2.80 I need a fairly sizable reduction in share count. So, is that true? Could you tell us how you're thinking about shares for next year? Are you intending to use the cash from McAfee to buy back shares to get to that number? Okay. For my follow-up, I wanted to, again, dig into the OpEx. You talked about a mix of the restructure and the cuts versus the reinvestment. But if I throw the McAfee cost back in, you've actually got OpEx going up fairly sizably year-over-year, and your employee count is actually up year-over-year, even though you supposedly had a pretty big layoff. So I guess, can you talk little bit more specifically about exactly what the additional spending is going on? Is it people, versus technology, versus something else? Where is it going? And do you view those investments as looking to open up new markets versus being defensive in nature? Or maybe a mix of both? Got it. Thank you guys. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Brian, my first question, I want to go back to the DCG ASPs in the December quarter. There were up 4% year-over-year, which reverses, I think, a four or five quarter trend of ASPs going down. I know that you've had mix headwinds that have been driving blended ASPs down. I am curious, what happened the fourth-quarter to drive ASPs up, and do you think it is sustainable? Is this just what we would expect to see the first quarter of the Broadwell launch? And then it normalizes going forward? Or how do you think about ASPs from here? That's helpful. And then maybe as my follow-up, Brian, relative to the guide, you're kind of expecting a significant drop in free cash flow this year, with the increase in CapEx. And you highlighted that CapEx is going to the non-volatile memory group. I'm just curious, given that business, even though it made some improvements in losses in the calendar fourth quarter, is still in a loss position. I'm assuming the higher CapEx is going to be a headwind to getting to profitability.  But I guess, how do you think about the path to profitability? The longer-term business model in memory? And what it might do to the DCG growth rate longer term if Xpoint is successful? Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, I'm curious with this new US administration. There is a lot of interest in using US-made products. And since you are fairly sizable fabs here in the US, I am wondering how you can take advantage of this environment, or if you are interested in making a bigger push in your foundry business? All right. And as my follow-up, back to DCG. There seem to be two moving pieces. You have this declining, but very profitable Enterprise part, but a faster growth, but perhaps less-profitable networking, and cloud and other areas. Is that fair characterization? And do you envision a point at which the non-Enterprise parts become dominant enough that you can actually see an acceleration in DCG back to your traditional double-digit type growth rate? Thank you. Thank you, I just had one question. I noticed that you did not raise the dividend in January, and Bob, I am curious if your view on capital returns, buybacks, and dividends is different than what Intel has done historically? Thank you. Nice quarter. Operator, I think we have time for two more questions. Hi. Good afternoon. This is Bill Peterson, calling for Harlan. Congratulations on the nice quarter. Coming back to the storage market. Trying to understand how you view growth this year in light of, obviously, good sequential growth in the prior quarter, but also overlaying that with the Optane qualifications that are going on in progress. How should we view that as terms of the incremental growth driver in 2017? I appreciate the color. Great. I appreciate the color on that. Maybe a question on the Programmable Solutions. The group has shown sequential declines in the prior two quarters versus your main competitor, who has shown sequential growth, albeit modestly. Discuss taking share --  and now you have the 14nm-based product. I wonder if you could provide color on maybe why that group has lagged in the prior few quarters. But more importantly,  when we should see the inflection in the business and how to think about growth in that business this year. Terrific color. Thanks, and congratulations on the quarter again. And Shanelle, please go ahead and introduce our last questioner. Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I want to ask, Bob, on the gross margin, your full year is equal to the Q1. Just maybe, as you look in the back half, I want to make sure I heard it straight. It sounded like 14 on the server side. May have some initial yields, and that would be headwind, but I am curious on the PC client as well. So maybe you could just talk about the puts and takes as you ramp in 10, but you still ship a lot of 14. As you look in the second half, what are the headwinds and tailwinds to gross margin? Thanks, and then just maybe a clarification. The $3 billion that you are getting from the sale, should I assume that goes to debt retirement like you have been using your cash flow? And, then I guess, you should get at some point this year, potentially the end the year, near that net-cash zero. Should we think about buybacks at that point? Thanks. Thanks, Blayne. Alright, thank you all for joining us today. Shanelle, please go ahead and wrap up the call.

INTC,Q2 2017,3170,3918,1045,"Thank you, Crystal. And welcome, everyone, to Intel's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should've received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO earnings presentation, which replaces the CFO commentary that we've previously provided. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com. The CFO earnings presentation is also available via the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO earnings presentation and earnings release, available on intc.com, include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. Thanks, Mark. Q2 was an outstanding quarter in which we set a number of records. We beat the expectations we set in April, primarily as a result of stronger desktop and notebook microprocessor volume, and set a second quarter revenue record. We're executing well to our priorities. And after adjusting for the McAfee transaction, revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while non-GAAP operating margin grew 30%. Our data-centric businesses were up 16% year-over-year. Technology and performance leadership are fueling our results. And in Q2, we extended our leadership with new breakthrough products in client computing, the data center and memory. With industry-leading products and a strong first half results, we're on a clear path for another record year. As we shared in February and reinforced in April, our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I outlined our top 4 priorities for the year in support of that strategy: growing the data center and adjacencies, ensuring a strong and healthy PC business, growing IoT and devices and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our progress in Q2. First, DCG. The data center business grew 9% in Q2 and remained on track to high single-digit growth for the year. Strong public cloud growth continued, with revenue up 35%. Enterprise was down 11%, as workloads continue to migrate to the cloud and memory and solid-state drive constraints impacted server deployment. Comms service provider revenue was up 17%, while adjacencies, which serve all customer segments, rose 12%. Cloud and comms service provider together are the growth engine in the data center and together now make up 60% of our DCG revenue. In 5G, we're demonstrating end-to-end leadership in client and infrastructure. We have 5 ongoing trials with leading global service providers and 15 more in the pipeline. And we're on track with our development of IA, FPGA and ASIC silicon platforms based on new radio standards. Earlier this month, we launched Xeon Scalable, formerly known as Skylake, and with it the industry's biggest platform advancement in a decade. Using Xeon Scalable, our customers have already achieved over 50 third-party-verified performance world records and are seeing more than 1.6x performance increase over our prior generation product across a wide range of real-world workloads. For example, the new AVX-512 instructions, double floating point performance, benefiting use cases like HPC, VR and AI. In fact, artificial intelligence inference throughput improves by 2.4x gen-to-gen. And when this silicon innovation is combined with our AI software frameworks optimization, customers, like Amazon Web Services, are seeing inference performance for improvement of more than 100x. The enthusiasm for Xeon Scalable resulted in our largest early ship program ever. We delivered more than 500,000 units to over 30 customers who appreciate outright performance leadership. The data center is central to our strategy and is a remarkable opportunity. By 2021, we expect the data center to be a $65 billion silicon opportunity, and we're less than 40% of the total available segment today. As we build out the adjacencies like Ethernet, silicon photonics and 3D XPoint memory and pool them all together with rack scale design, we'll be positioned to deliver even higher levels of performance and efficiency to our customers and increase our percentage of the total TAM. The Client Computing Group also delivered fantastic result. Revenue was up 12% over last year, as product leadership, combined with a disciplined segmentation strategy, led to rising core mix. We, along with our customers and partners in the PC supply chain, are driving the evolution of the PC experience, as users seek out high performance and new form factors. We launched a powerful, new Intel Core X-Series processor family, including a new Core i9 Extreme Edition Processor, extending our performance leadership. And we'll be shipping our first 10-nanometer product near the end of the year, beginning with a lower volume SKU and followed by multiple SKUs and a volume ramp in the first half of 2018. We've seen some modest improvements in the PC consumption, but we continue to expect a mid-single-digit TAM decline for the full year. We also began shipping our next-generation 4G LTE modem, known as the 7480, to customers. As I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to make great progress with our wireless ecosystem laying the groundwork for 5G. And starting in 2018, Intel will partner on what is expected to be the first 5G showcase at the Olympic Games. In our Internet of Things business, we're focused on 4 key verticals: retail, video, industrial and transportation. We saw strong growth across all 4, leading to a 26% increase in revenue. We're specifically excited to see the ramp of our IVI designs with both Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota. We're also about to mark a very important milestone in our transformation. We expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter, several months earlier than expected. Autonomous driving is a massive compute workload that will disrupt industries and save lives, and we are investing to win in this important segment. I'm excited to welcome the Mobileye team to Intel. Together, we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving system, data and services market opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud to car solutions faster and at a lower cost. And we're looking forward to talking with you in more detail about our plan and the progress we're making in the segment later this quarter. Memory and FPGAs round out our priorities for the year. Our memory business grew 58% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record. A cornerstone for our strategy in this segment is differentiated technology. And that differentiation was on display earlier this month when we announced availability of the industry's first and to date only 64-layer 3D NAND SSDs. Our floating gate architecture already enabled industry-leading density at 32 layers. And we believe our density lead is even greater at 64. We also shipped more than 200,000 units of our revolutionary Optane memory for clients, which are available via our OEM partners and channel partners, and have more than 50 data center customers testing Optane SSDs currently, which will ship for revenue this year. Optane DIMMs remaining on track for availability next year. Our memory factory, Fab 68, continues to exceed expectations, ramping ahead of schedule in terms of both output and yield. This will be a big part of our overall supply growth in the second half, which we expect to be greater than 20%. The combination of strong execution and favorable market condition is accelerating our path to profitability. Core NAND returned to profitability this quarter, ahead of our earlier estimate, and we expected it to remain profitable for the balance of the year. We also now expect the entire NSG segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018 versus our prior end of 2018 target. Lastly, our FPGA business was down 5% over last year on weaker data center and comp sectors but remain on track to our mid-single-digit growth target for the full year with broad re-acceleration in the second half across markets, including the data center segment. At their Build Conference in May, Microsoft disclosed a major advancement in the deployment of Intel FPGAs, resulting in the industry's fastest public cloud network and new technology for acceleration of deep neural networks. Audi selected Intel for the level 3 autonomous driving systems in its upcoming A8, where our Cyclone V SoC FPGA technology will perform object and map fusion as well as parking pilot and sensor data preprocessing. We're also seeing strong adoption of our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs. We continue to gain key design wins in our focus segments, and we're on track to production later this year. To sum it up, I'm very pleased with our progress, and I'm more confident than ever in Intel's future and growth. Based on our strong first half and higher expectations for the PC business and the expected close of Mobileye, we're raising our full year revenue forecast from $60 billion to $61.3 billion and our non-GAAP EPS forecast from $2.85 to $3. We continue to see intense competition across our businesses. That's the reality of the attractive markets in which we participate. The competition makes us stronger, and we're ready for it. We're executing well to our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. The PC TAM is down more than 15% versus 4 years ago. Despite that headwind, our revenue is up more than 15%, and our operating profit has grown more than 30%. More than 40% of our revenue now comes from our data-centric businesses, outside the PC sector. And those businesses together are growing at double-digit rates. And while we're growing the top line, we're intensely focused on operating efficiency. We now expect spending as a percent of revenue to decline about 160 basis points versus last year, bringing it below 34%, on track to the 30% goal we're committed to, to hit by 2020. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon. Like Brian said, we had an outstanding quarter and executed on several important milestones. Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, excluding the Intel Security Group. From an earnings perspective, operating income was $4.2 billion, up 30% year-over-year, and EPS of $0.72 was up 22% year-over-year. Our EPS performance was the result of strong top line growth, good gross margin improvement and excellent spending leverage. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $4.7 billion in cash flow from operations, returned $2.6 billion to shareholders and have capital in place to fund the Mobileye acquisition. The planned acquisition of Mobileye, which will fuel our growth in the automotive segment, is expected to close in Q3, well ahead of our schedule. At our Analyst Day in February, we talked about our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, a company well positioned to power the cloud and the billions of smart and connected devices. Our Q2 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation, with the data-centric businesses, those outside of the PC segment, up 16% year-over-year. Our PC-centric business executed extremely well in a declining market and was up 12%. Our data-centric businesses are more than 40% of the company's overall revenue. Moving to earnings. We are seeing broad growth across the business, driving 4 points of operating margin leverage and 22% EPS growth year-over-year. Earnings growth is driven by strong top line growth for both the PC and data-centric businesses, improving unit cost with 14-nanometer ramp and gains from the sale of a portion of our equity investments in ASML. On our Q1 earnings call, Brian and I talked about our commitment to achieving spending target of approximately 30% of revenue no later than 2020. We've made great progress in the second quarter, as total spending was down 330 basis points year-over-year. We've continued investments in our key priorities, including artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and Moore's Law, while at the same time capturing benefits of our previously announced restructuring program and significant leverage from strong top line growth. R&D spending was down 1 point, and our SG&A costs were down 2.2 points. On a full year basis, we expect direct spending to be below 34%, approximately a 0.5 point better than our prior guidance. Let me touch briefly on our segment performance on Slide 5. The Client Computing Group had another outstanding quarter. Revenue of $8.2 billion was up 12% year-over-year. Client ASPs were up 8% year-over-year, as we continue to see strength in our gaming segment and strong core mix. We also continue to see the worldwide supply chain operate at healthy levels. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating profit growing 58% from a year ago. And the business continues to execute and benefit from a continued improvement in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending. Moving to Slide 6. The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.4 billion, up 9% year-over-year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in both the comms and cloud service provider segments, which are nearly 60% of our DCG revenue. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased technology development cost and higher artificial intelligence and adjacency spending. Versus the first quarter, our revenue accelerated 3%, and our operating margin improved by 3 points. We are on track to our full year guide of revenue growth in the high single digits and operating margin of over 40% for the full year. The IoT, NSG and PSG business segments are well positioned to capitalize on the explosion of data and are becoming a larger component of our overall business, growing 28% year-over-year. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $720 million, growing 26% year-over-year, driven by strength in industrial and video and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit was $139 million, up 56% year-over-year on higher volume and ASPs, offset by continued investment in automotive. Our memory business had a record revenue of $874 million, up 58% year-over-year, with strong demand from data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. This segment had an operating loss of $110 million, largely driven by cost associated with 3D XPoint and start-up cost for our memory capacity. Our memory fab in Dalian continues to make great progress and is ramping several weeks ahead of schedule. Yields continue to improve, and unit costs are well ahead of expectations. The core NAND business returned to profitability in the second quarter. And we expect the core NAND business to be profitable for the full year and the memory business as a whole to be profitable in 2018, both ahead of our prior estimates. The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $440 million, down 5% year-over-year. Operating profit was $97 million, flat year-over-year after acquisition-related impacts. We're making good progress in realizing cost synergies with the integration of this business. Moving to Slide 8. Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and progress. Our priorities: first, invest in the business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, in the quarter we generated $4.7 billion of cash from operations. We purchased $2.8 billion in capital assets, paid $1.3 billion in dividends and repurchased about $1.3 billion of stocks. In addition, we received cash of approximately $900 million as a portion of our Intel Security divestiture. And we generated approximately $1.3 billion from the sales of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $796 million of pretax gains. At quarter end, cash and long-term investments was $34 billion, up $11 billion, and total debt was $32 billion. Offshore cash investments and proceeds from the sale of our ASML investments are being used to fund the Mobileye acquisition. Now let me turn to guidance on Slide 9. Some context. First, while we see slightly higher PC TAM and supply chain inventory replenishment contributing to higher expectations for annual revenue, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third-party analysts. Second, we continue to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year, and we expect the memory fab in Dalian to support higher second half demand levels. And third, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter and as such are including expectations for this business into our guidance. Based on these factors, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $1.3 billion to $61.3 billion, operating income guidance by $600 million to $17.9 billion and EPS guidance by $0.15 to $3 per share. The improvement in revenue outlook is driven by a strong first half, higher expectations of the PC business and the inclusion of Mobileye. The improvement in operating margin is primarily driven by our increased revenue outlook. Our outlook for full year spending is $20.7 billion, as we expect modest increases related to revenue growth and the integration of Mobileye. The increase in EPS is driven by higher expectations of revenue, coupled with gains on sale of our equity investments and the inclusion of Mobileye. We expect Mobileye to contribute approximately $200 million of revenue, $100 million of operating income and $0.02 of EPS in the second half of the year. And on Slide 11. As we look to the third quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $15.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year, excluding Intel Security Group. And we expect operating income of $4.8 billion and EPS to be approximately $0.80. 2017 is shaping up to be another record year for Intel. We feel great about where we are 6 months into our 3-year transformation. We exceeded our EPS expectations for Q2 and increased our profit expectations for the full year. At the same time, we are investing to compete and win in an expanding market fueled by the growth of data. We are already seeing an impact from our data-centric-oriented businesses, up double digits collectively, as we continue to transform the company from a PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud. With that, let me turn it over to Mark. All right. Thank you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and a follow-up if you have one. Crystal, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","I was curious on the -- on the data center business, maybe you can just talk about the growth you need sequentially in the back half to get to that high single digits for the year. Maybe you can just talk about it by segment. I know cloud was up a lot in Q2, the enterprise down. Clarify by segment as well as the contribution from scalable into those segments. What's the right timing to think about as those ramp in? Sure. Thanks, Blayne, for the question. So I'll start, and Bob can add some comments at the end. We think the data center continues to be just a great growth engine for the company. And you saw the 9% growth this quarter. What we have really been also focusing on at the same time is really increasing operating margin, and I want to make that point. You saw our operating margin increased to 38% this quarter. You'll see us continue to raise that operating margin so that we're back at the 40-plus-percent operating margin for the back half and for the year. First, kind of want to kind of lay that groundwork. What we've projected for the second half is quarters that are pretty much in line. We continue to expect enterprise to continue to decline. It declined a bit more in the second quarter than -- I think we had really projected a decline at about 11%. But if you look at Q1, it declined a little less than we expected at 3%, but we still expect it to decline in those high single-digit numbers. Cloud though grew greater than what we expected at 36%. We expect it to be in the mid-20s, probably more likely. And then data center -- I mean networking and comms, 17%. Adjacencies at 12%. So we expect that trend to continue. We don't need any big shift in those trends to really get to that high single-digit growth rate for the data center. We talked about Xeon Scalable. The initial reaction has been extremely positive. You see the largest number of prequalification samples sent out to customers. You see the cloud applications. We try to talk about it. It's the largest performance improvement in a decade gen-to-gen. So we're seeing a very large ramp in the second half as we move on with the Xeon Scalable. And so I think that's what's going to fuel second half '17. And then -- but it's going to continue on into '18 as well. So I think that's kind of how we see the second half playing out. The only thing I would add, Brian, is we came into the year looking at high single-digit growth for the business and margins expanding quarter-by-quarter throughout the year. And kind of 2 months in, we see nice acceleration on both top and bottom line. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're comfortable with the full year outlook that we've given. And the only dynamic other than the things Brian highlighted as Q3 comps are a little tougher as we enter the second half of the year, but we feel good about kind of the mix of the business as we go through '17 and beyond. Just to reiterate a point Brian said, with the strong cloud growth and the strong performance in the comms and networking space, we now generate 60% of our revenues from the higher-growth aspects of the business. So we think that, that bears well for us in 2017 but also going into '18 and beyond. And then I did want to ask you on the memory side. You're looking for a breakeven next year. What is driving that? Obviously, memory pricing has been strong, but I was just wondering if there's any other factors you're now adding to that outlook. Sure. So let's make sure we clarify, right? So on traditional NAND, we are breakeven this year, and we broke even actually this quarter. And we expect to remain there the rest of the year. When we talk about for next year, that's inclusive of 3D XPoint. And so the difference is really as we ramp products on 3D XPoint and as we ramp out the rest of Fab 68, both of those -- whenever you're ramping a factory, you always -- because you have a certain amount of underutilization of the equipment just as you start to get it going, you tend to have slightly higher cost. And so that's what you see as the driver for the rest of the profitability growth as we go into next year. And what I'll also say that the 64-tier NAND product gives us cost and performance advantage just because they're leading-edge products as well. Now it's going to play into as we move to the remainder of this year and next year. So it's 64-tier products on traditional NAND, the ramp out of Fab 68 and then the real start-up and continuation and getting the rest of the products qualified on 3D XPoint is what gets us everything profitable next year. I don't want to say that they're going to ""normalize"" and that they're going to -- there's not going to be a major shift. The trend of -- look, enterprise is going to continue to decline. We estimate, and again, this is just based on what we get from our customers, talking to the industry, it's going to be in a high single-digit decline. I think you'll see quarters like Q2 that was 11%. You'll see quarters like Q1 that were 3% or 4%. We've seen quarters higher than the 11% over the last couple of years. So it's going to be lumpy as we see this shift, but the overall macro shift of enterprise to cloud or traditional on-prem systems to cloud is going to continue. I think we'll also see -- we still, again, talking to our partners, thinking that mid-20s for cloud growth. But I think we'll see quarters like this quarter that was a little bit high. Other quarters we've had in the past have been more in line. So I don't think we're talking about something going normalizing. I'd say it's still going to stay relatively lumpy like this. But if you look at it over the long haul, even if you look at the first half of the year, 11% down this quarter, 3% down last quarter, you take a look at that as on average and you get to that high single-digit number. So I still feel like that's going to be roughly about where it goes down. And then the cloud will continue to grow at that rate plus additional as more of the growth goes into the cloud. The only thing I'd add Brian is the supply-demand and balance of SSDs in the quarter, we believe, had an impact on the enterprise sector. And as that supply-demand and balance kind of normals out, we think that will help. But all that being said, the trends Brian highlighted is still kind of how we see the workloads playing out over time. Yes, just on the second one first. The short answer is yes. The combination of the incremental growth and the addition of Mobileye are the primary drivers for the slightly higher spend. I would -- your initial comment on flow-through, to put it into context, from where we were in January, our full year outlook, the revenue is up roughly $1.8 billion. And with that $1.8 billion, there'll be roughly $200 million of costs, primarily Mobileye. So in context, we feel like we're managing the cost and spending side of the business effectively as we position to a 30% spending of revenue by 2020 at the latest. In terms of the gross margin dynamics, I think the trends that you've seen over the last couple of quarters we expect to continue through the year. And it's really ASP improvements, good unit cost performance, volume leverage to the fab kind of working in our favor. And on the flip side, the strong growth of the memory and the modem business and the ramp cost for 10-nanometer are partial offsets. Those dynamics are what has driven the strong gross margins in the 63% range in the first half. And we expect those same dynamics to play out in the second half as well. Brian, for my first one. My question is on the competitive landscape and the data center. There's been a lot of discussion about AMD perhaps posing more competition than it has in the last several years. And I appreciate it's early days and you have a very strong product out. But are you hearing about them more in your customer conversations? Is that a more real threat than it has been in the past? Because they did have an event, they did show up with 10-plus potential customers. And some of the benchmark data, they are showing some performance that is perhaps better at a lower price. So how real is that competition and how are you reacting to it? Sure, Vivek. So I think in general we see competition across almost every one of our platforms, whether it be in the data center or in the client business. And it's come from a variety of sources. You're right, AMD has kind of raised up a bit with their more recent products, but you see us responding. This is a traditional performance battle that we're very accustomed to and we're comfortable in reacting and competing very aggressively in. And so you see us coming out with our Xeon Scalable. You'll see us make maneuvers like we accelerate our Core i9 products, which are all the way up to 18-thread systems on the client-based products. So I'd tell you that, yes, we're seeing increased competitive pressure from a variety of places. But that actually will just drive us even harder, make us better in the end. And we're comfortable that we can make the right products to deliver the right performance against those. And as my follow-up, Brian, if could you give us a little bit more color on your 10-nanometer progress. What is the timing of products around that node? And as part of that if Bob could remind us how the CapEx and depreciation and OpEx for that node are flowing through the financials? Sure. So on 10 nanometers, we are sampling engineering samples to customers currently. We -- the yields on 10 nanometers are continuing to improve pretty much right in line with the forecasted ramp rates. It's a new technology, so you always have some problems to go solve, but we're pretty comfortable with where we're at right now. Like we said in the earnings script, we are set to qualify the first production products right at -- right towards the end of the year. You'll see those start to ship in the first half of next year, and you'll see a ramp of SKUs. One of the things we're seeing is each one of these technologies -- and actually products that we generate, we're generating quite a few more SKUs, Vivek. And so you'll see a variety of SKUs progressing through to 2018 as we ramp the 10-nanometer products, starting with, I'll call it, more simpler SKUs at the beginning, going all the way through the high-performance, high-complexity SKUs towards the middle and back half of the year, which is -- it's a traditional ramp like you see us push out on a new product ramp. And then just in terms of the capital, yes, just as a reminder, our full year outlook for CapEx is roughly $12 billion. We did indicate that approximately $2.5 billion of that would be for memory. So underlying that, you have $9.5 billion CapEx for the logic business. For 10 nanometer, specifically, you have TD lines and pilot lines going in this year and beginning to scale, as we match the capacity with the production that scales in the first half and second half of next year. So that's reflected in the CapEx guide and the depreciation guide that we gave you earlier in the year, and that hasn't really changed. So I think Stacy, first, we're quite proud of the growth rate we're seeing and especially the growth rates in the growth segments. We're forecasting mid-20s for the cloud business, the networking and storage business and adjacencies on down. What we're having to counter is not only the comps that Bob talked about but the declining function of the enterprise, right? And so that -- those 2 things counter those growth rates. Now as the enterprise continues to shrink, it'll become less and less moving forward. So we agree that over time this will become a smaller and smaller impact to the growth rates. But right now it's still a large enough percentage. It weighs on our ability to get the growth rate higher. And I would -- if I sounded like I was giving an excuse, I maybe should correct that. We feel great about where we are. First half, up 7%. Full year, up high single digits. Profit expanded during the course of the year and continuing to win in those segment of the market that have differentiated growth rates. So 6 months into the year, we feel good about where we are, and we're excited about the new product that we launched. Yes, I think as we look at kind of the quarter performance -- I should start with kind of the TAM overall, and Brian highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We have assumed that PC TAM will continue to decline in the mid-single digits for the full year. On the margin, that might be a little bit better today than what it was 6 months ago. But we're still -- we're not counting on a dramatic change in the PC TAM consumption for the year. That being said, we've taken up our guidance quite a bit. So in that, there's a stronger Q2 performance with a little bit of more healthy inventory channels as we go into the second half of the year. So I wouldn't -- if they were -- if the inventory was maybe a little bit leaner over the last 3 to 4 quarters, I think we'd characterize them in the healthy level now. And we think the ecosystem is building for a second half that's consistent with our outlook for PC TAM. Say it again? I think the inventory levels as we see it in the channel is slightly higher than the lean levels they've been for the last couple of quarters, but no dramatic difference from our perspective on how we see PC TAM for the full year. Sure, John. So we expect the second half of 2017, from an ASP perspective, to be pretty much what you've seen in the past where ASPs continue to increase on the various platforms of Xeon, right? So looking at each one, you'll see ASPs overall increasing. What you're seeing on this is a little bit of mix, right? So as you saw networking and storage grow at 17%, the adjacencies at 12%, those are starting to become a little bit more percentage of that business, and those draw down overall ASPs a little bit. But if you look within just the Xeon core function, those ASPs continue to decline -- to increase at about the normal rates that you'd expect as we move into -- especially as you move into a new architectural like Xeon Scalable. I actually think there is. I think if you take a look at this, John, what's driven this has not been clever segmentation necessarily. It's been the ability to segment into specific markets and specific performance. And so things like Core i9 are a good example, where you're really targeting performance. And so what you -- what I believe is that what -- the growth areas in the client space gaming, virtual reality, thin and light, they're requiring performance and power. And remember, those are always somewhat tradable as you take a look at the -- and so those trends are going to continue. And that's why -- that's -- as we talk about how do you feel about competition, where do you see competition playing, we believe our leadership in performance will continue to allow that trend to continue and continuing to allow the trend within CCG to continue as well. And that's part of what drove the forecast for the second half. It looks like this is the fifth consecutive quarter that CCG beat expectations. Revenues were up 12%. And I think there's a debate out there as to whether or not you deserve credit for this performance, with skeptics really pointing toward -- to sustainability more than anything else. When you break down that 12%, as you guys mentioned, ASPs are a big part of the increase. My question is as you look at sort of the mix in that business overall is there room to drive ASPs higher and effectively capture more value inside of the PC TAM? So yes, is the simple answer, Romit. Remember, this isn't necessarily us raising prices. So it's not we're out there and going and saying, ""Okay, I'm going to charge $10 more for the next Core i7."" It's actually the percentage of units that are being bought at those higher units. And we continue to deliver higher performance at the same price with each one of these generations. So what you're seeing is actually an overall trend that, yes, units are down. We talked about that, both [Brian] and Bob, around TAM being down somewhere in that low- to mid-single-digit range. And that's pretty much in line with what I'm seeing third parties. Sure, some third parties are a little bit better than that. But for the most part, we're within a couple of percent. But yes, we believe that there is room for continued demand for movement upwards. So if you a numbers of Core i7s, a number of Core i9, the number of people buying the performance thin and light laptops, those are going to continue. And you see it in our OEM partners and the type of systems they're producing and the type of systems they're bringing to market. Now they're targeting that more and more as well. The only thing I would add is, again, we have a business that has a declining market. It's growing not by raising prices but, to Brian's point, by a market that increasingly values performance. And the operating margins of the business for the first half of the year were up over 50%. So this team through its segmentation is executing extremely well. And then as we mentioned earlier, yes, with that great margin performance, we are redeploying our resources to invest in these data-centric set of businesses that have high-growth characteristics that collectively were up 16% again in the quarter. And through this journey of a PC TAM decline, we have a bigger business, a stronger business and a more profitable business, with an increasing portion, over 40%, coming from high-growth-oriented businesses. So great performance in a declining market, continuing to invest in it and reallocate across our portfolio and feel good about our -- the portfolio we have and with the addition of Mobileye as we head into the second half of the year. And in terms like -- you obviously provide ASPs for CCG. But is the core mix as a percentage of units a metric that we should be focusing on? And I -- if I remember correctly, that percentage was close to 70%. I'm curious where it is today. Yes, it's continuing to climb. It is, but don't forget even within that core mix, Romit, you have the ability to continue to scale up, so Core i3 versus Core i5 versus Core i7. And now we've introduce the Core i9, right, which is even a higher performance. So we saw earlier on people choosing Core over Pentium or Atom, for example, and you saw the core mix move up. You're now seeing not only that continue to climb, but you're going to see within Core the amount of Core i7s, Core i9s, Core i5s continue to climb as well. And that's why we continue to see that there's legs behind this. And you kind of said, hey, are we getting credit for this, right? We don't think when you look at overall this business, last year's performance with great growth in all of the segments, you look at this year's performance so far in the first half and our projections now in the second half, we think that our ability to segment, to drive better operating margin and to continue to drive performance into the PC and keep it more and more profitable while we invest and grow these other businesses, we think that there's an option around Intel that is quite good. Okay. Yes. It's very little. We don't give out exact percentages by SKU like that. But I can genuinely tell you that it is really just the beginning of the ramp of the Xeon Scalable. And so its impact into Q2 was minimal at best. What you'll see is as it ramps into the second half it becomes a higher and higher percentage. And really, the big volume is going to be 2018. So that's when it really takes over from way -- the way the data center looks from a revenue and profit standpoint. What we're excited about is -- we talked about the 500,000 units that are out there. That was the highest number of pre-samples. That shows you the demand by the big infrastructure guys around the performance. They were willing to take the product even before, ""We are ready to start shipping it."" And then the number of records we've broken already in performance, we talked about 50 records worldwide already, those are laying the groundwork for how this ramp is going to look and feel as we move into the second half and into '18. Sure. So our whole strategy around the memory is that we are focused on differentiation and performance and specifically around supporting the data center. We do sell into client as well, but that's not the main focus of this business. And so I tell you that's -- when we talk about our growth and when we talk about our projections for the rest of this year and why we're investing in the future, that 64-tier NAND gives us the ability to be a better cost but at the high-performance end. So we're not going after commodity SSDs that you're going to see even in higher-end workstations necessarily. It's really focused towards the data center products. Even still, there's -- not all SSDs and data centers are high-end performance. So we're comfortable with where we are in the market share. We want to balance those investments against the demand for these high-performance areas and make sure we stay -- we keep that in balance. And our real goal is then to move more and more of the business towards the 3D XPoint as we move into next year because that really differentiates us again as we really change the hierarchy between memory and storage as the data center DIMM memory systems come out.","Brian, I wanted to follow up the data center side that Blayne just asked about and get a little more color about the acceleration on the cloud side and the deceleration on the enterprise side. Could you give any more color on why you think those were at the extremes and why do you think they normalize going forward, that would be helpful. That's very helpful. I guess for my follow-up, if I could shift gears over to the margin side of things and specifically the fall-through. It was great to see that you guys beat your OpEx guidance for the second quarter. As we think about the full year with revenues going up, why isn't gross margin changing at all? And then the OpEx increase ex Mobileye, is that just the variable comp that comes in with bonuses, et cetera? Or is there something else in that roughly $150 million increase to your spending line? I had a question on the trajectory of data center growth into the second half. And to be honest, I'm still wondering why you don't think you can do better than high-single digits. I mean, I know you're calling out the tough comp in Q3, but it's only like 10%, right, which is roughly in line with the full year guidance. It's below kind of the longer-term CAGR. So you're going to seek no comps at that level or higher kind of in the perpetuity. I guess, why call that out as an excuse? And what are the issues in terms of hoping and driving for a bigger lift in the second half versus what you're still currently guiding for with the Skylake SP launch on its way? Got it. So my follow-up. On the PC side of things, I know you said that the channel's healthy, but you -- it's sound like you also had channel fill in the quarter, and it's also included in the guide going forward. So I guess if the channel's healthy, why is there inventory filling up? And what does that imply as we kind of get to the year and look into next year for the likely trajectory of your product sales into that market? And it needs to build inventory to do that? Any it needs to build inventory to do that? Brian, I apologize if I missed this in your prepared comments. My first question is just around pricing in DCG. It was down about 1% sequentially. There's always a lot of mixed things there. You usually have some commentary about ASPs per bucket. Were they still strong? And I guess more importantly, as you think about the product launches in the back half of the year, at least some of our initial checks are suggesting that customers are kind of chomping at the bit to high -- to buy higher up into the stack, which could drive some good ASPs. Can you talk about your expectations around ASPs and/or attach rates for adjacency data center businesses with the launch of the Xeon Scalable? That's helpful. And for my follow-on, just turning to the client compute group. Your ability to sort of segment that market and drive higher mix has been sort of a multiyear endeavor with a lot of success. What inning do you think you guys are in, in that process, especially with AMD coming to market with new product? Is there still a mix -- a potential story here? And what would drive that? In DCG, you guys are probably full throttle from a manufacturing perspective for Xeon Scalable, or Skylake, in the June quarter. But my question is how much of the data center growth in June was the initial production revenue shipments of Xeon Scalable to your customers? Or did that contribute just very little to the June quarter mix? And good to see the profitability in the NAND segment. In enterprise SSD, I think you guys are still the #2 global market share leader there. And it looks like based on the first half performance you guys are outpacing the market. So I guess the question is, where's the team winning? Is it high capacity? Is it high performance for these enterprise and cloud drives? And similar to maybe some of your peers, is the team currently capacity constrained? Thanks, Harlan. All right. Thank you all for joining us today. Crystal, please go ahead and wrap up the call.

INTC,Q3 2017,3282,3961,1430,"Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO earnings presentation, which replaces the CFO commentary that we provided in the past. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com. The CFO earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release, available on intc.com, include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. Thanks, Mark. The third quarter exceeded our expectations with revenue of $16.1 billion, which was $400 million better than our outlook. Operating income of $5.6 billion was more than $700 million better than our outlook. Our data-centric businesses grew 15% year-over-year, reaching 45% of our revenue, proving that Intel is becoming a data-centric company. The fiscal discipline that Bob and I have talked about is delivering results even faster than we had forecasted, while simultaneously allowing us to focus more on innovation in our key growth segments. Revenue grew 2%, or 6% after adjusting for the McAfee transaction. Operating income grew 8%, and earnings per share grew 26%, both reaching all-time records. Added all together, and this was a remarkable quarter in what is shaping up to be a remarkable year. Our strategy is to be the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. Our data-centric businesses are the company's growth engine. Individually, these businesses provide great value to our customers. Collectively, they're solving our customers' problems in a way that no individual business or product could. We've built a collection of capabilities that is unmatched. At the same time, our PC business remains central to our success. It's a source of great profit, cash flow, scale and intellectual property. We've made great progress in both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses over the last few months, and I'll share a few important milestones that illustrate that progress. I'm going to start with CCG, which produced exceptional results despite a declining PC TAM. PC market conditions continued to improve, and we achieved record Core i5 plus Core i7 client mix. Our focus on an annual beat rate of innovation and thoughtful segmentation, combined with an investment strategy designed to produce results even in a declining market, is paying off. We're especially excited about the launch of our latest Eighth Generation Core processor, codenamed Coffee Lake. The Coffee Lake family includes our first 6-core desktop CPU. And it's our best gaming processor to date, with up to 50% better performance than the competition on top-game titles. We're on track to ship our first low-volume 10-nanometer part by the end of the year. That will be followed by the initial ramp in the first half of 2018, with both high volume and system availability in the second half of 2018. We shipped our first modem into the auto industry, and our modem revenue was up 37% in total over last year. Moving on to our data-centric businesses, DCG revenue grew 7% in Q3 and remains on track for high single-digit growth for the year. We saw strong cloud growth outgrew the comm service provider in market. And while the enterprise decline moderated sequentially, we still see workloads moving to the cloud. Cloud and comm service provider revenue combined is nearly 60% of DCG revenue now. In less than 3 months, we've had more than 200 Xeon Scalable OEM systems begin production shipments. And our customers across all of our segments are beginning deployments that will continue to ramp in Q4 and through 2018. In our Internet of Things business, revenue was up 23% with strengths across the retail, industrial and video segments. We also continue to build momentum in the vehicle infotainment market, winning designs from our competitors at leading automakers. Earlier in the quarter, we closed the Mobileye transaction, a full 4 months ahead of schedule. So far this year, Mobileye has won 14 ADAS designs across 14 automakers, a pace well ahead of the 12 wins they recorded all of last year. These designs provide for typical features like automated emergency braking, lane keeping and adaptive cruise control, but several also include next step functionality like highway autonomous driving. We're also winning marquee designs for Level 3 and higher levels of autonomy, including our strategic partnership with BMW and Fiat Chrysler. Most recently, we announced that Waymo's newest vehicles, the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans, feature Intel-based technologies for sensor processing, general compute and connectivity. With 3 million miles of real-world driving, Waymo cars with Intel technology inside have already processed more self-driving car miles than any other autonomous fleet on the U.S. roads. Intel and Mobileye provide the auto industry with unmatched product breadth, the architectural flexibility to support open and closed implementations and technology leadership. Our progress in just a few short months illustrates the benefits of our combination. And together, we can deliver the promise of autonomous driving and a safer collision-free future. Let's move on now to memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 37% over last year. And operating margin improved significantly as Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continued to beat both its ramp rate and yield goal. Fab 68 accounted for more than half of our supply in the quarter, where more than 70% of the total bits were 3D NAND. Our memory innovation and technology leadership is having an impact. We shipped the industry's first 64-layer data center SSDs and have a strong Optane design win pipeline. That leadership technology has also resulted in strong customer interest in long-term supply agreements, and we've already signed 2 such agreements. Bob will share more about our approach, but this is an important step that will mitigate the short-term cash flow impacts of ramping our memory capacity. And finally in our FPGA business, revenue was up 10% over last year with growth in the data center, embedded and automotive segments, where we're ramping designs like the Level 3 autonomous 2018 Audi A8 and DENSO's stereo vision system. Strength in these segments was partially offset by continued weakness in comms infrastructure. Our design win revenue value was up more than 10% in the third quarter, its highest level in more than 3 years. This business is essential to our success in artificial intelligence. In Q3, Microsoft announced that it would use our 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGAs for its accelerated deep learning platform that's codenamed Project Brainwave. And as part of a broadening engagement between our companies, Alibaba is using Intel FPGAs to power the acceleration of the service of Alibaba Cloud. We made tremendous progress in AI and advanced computing technologies over the last few months. In addition to our FPGAs and autonomous driving wins, we launched the Movidius Myriad X, the world's first vision processing unit with a dedicated Neural Compute Engine to deliver artificial intelligence capabilities to the edge in a low-power, high-performance package. We also achieved new research milestones, as Intel scientists pursue exciting, emerging forms of compute. We delivered a 17-qubit superconducting test chip for quantum computing to our research partner, QuTech, and we'll follow that up with a 49-qubit test chip by the end of the year. We also unveiled the Loihi, a self-learning test chip that mimics the brain's basic mechanics and makes machine learning faster and more efficient. Later this quarter, we'll ship the Nervana neural network processor, the industry's first commercially available processor of its kind. I also announced last week that Facebook is working in close collaboration with us, sharing their technical insights as we bring this new generation of AI hardware to market. Together, these accomplishments reinforce several things for me. First, Intel is the leader in AI inference from the core of the data center to autonomous vehicles, out to the edge devices where low power is especially critical. Second, artificial intelligence takes many forms and will require computing solutions that are tailored for the workload, the environment and the user, rather than a one-size-fits-all. And third, our investments and pipeline of innovation position us to lead for years to come. We had a quarter any CEO would be proud of. And I'd like to take a moment to remember our former CEO and my friend, Paul Otellini. Paul had an enormous impact on the industry and this company, and his Intel family will miss him. He would be proud of our growing momentum, and it's an important part of his legacy. Wrapping things up, I'm excited about both our progress and our prospects. And we're competing aggressively for our $260 billion TAM, the largest opportunity in our history with lots of room to grow market segment share. In some of our segments, we're facing new or resurging competitors. In other segments, we are the new competitor. But in all cases, competition brings out the very best in our company, as our third quarter results demonstrates. We're now well ahead of our commitments we made to you in January. Our transformation is accelerating. And we're raising our full year expectations for revenue by $700 million and for operating profit by $900 million, our third consecutive increase this year. This puts us solidly on track to deliver the best year in the company's history for the second year in a row. And with that great news, I'd like to hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon. This was an excellent quarter for Intel. Versus the expectations we set out at the beginning of the quarter, our revenue is better, our gross margins were stronger and our spending was lower. As Brian said, we're on track for another record in 2017. Revenue in the quarter was $16.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year, excluding McAfee, and we achieved record earnings. Operating income was $5.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. And EPS was $1.01, up 26% year-over-year. From a capital allocation perspective, we closed the Mobileye transaction and funded a significant portion of the purchase price through the sale of noncore assets, including reducing our position in ASML and proceeds from the partial exit at McAfee. Additionally, we signed long-term NAND supply agreements providing more than $2 billion in prepayments through 2018, significantly improving free cash flow for our memory business. We generated $6.3 billion in cash flow from operations, and we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders. At our Analyst Day in February, we talked about our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Our Q3 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation. Intel's data-centric businesses, those outside of the PC segment, grew 15% year-over-year and now represent 45% of our revenue, up from approximately 30% in 2012. This collection of businesses is well positioned to capitalize on industry trends, create great value for our customers and represents the company's growth engine going forward. Our PC-centric business generated flat revenue in the quarter and improved operating margin by over 3 points. The CCG team continues to execute extremely well in a declining PC TAM environment. Our focus on performance-leading products and a smart segmentation strategy is working. This business provides scale, funds IP and generates a significant portion of the company's profits and cash flows. Moving to earnings. We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, up 26% year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by solid platform execution, strong growth from our adjacent products and businesses and lower spending, resulting in $408 million growth in operating income. Additionally, we continued to monetize some of our ICAP Portfolio position, resulting in a gain of $0.13 per share. We made a commitment at the beginning of the year to reduce spending to 30% of revenue by 2020 at the latest, while continuing to invest in key growth areas and capabilities. We are making great progress. Total spending was down 6% year-over-year in the third quarter. We've continued investments in our key priorities, including driving Moore's Law forward, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. At the same time, we're executing with operational discipline and generating significant leverage from higher revenue growth. Our R&D spending as a percent of revenue was flat, and our SG&A costs were down 3 points as we rationalize our marketing and sales programs and generate significant leverage in our G&A functions. In addition, we made changes to our co-marketing programs to provide more flexibility and efficiency to our customers. These changes resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $200 million during the quarter, reducing year-over-year growth in CCG by approximately 2 points and DCG by just over 0.5 point, with a corresponding reduction in spending. These changes collectively have no impact on operating income. The impact of these changes will continue into Q4 at a slightly increased level. On a full year basis, we expect direct spending to be approximately 33%, 1 point better than our prior guidance and down over 2 full points from last year. Let me touch briefly on our segment performance on Slide 5. The Client Computing Group had another outstanding quarter. Revenue of $8.9 billion was flat year-over-year and operating margins grew by 3 points. Flat revenue was driven by client ASPs up 7%, unit volume down 7% and our adjacency business up 15%, partially offset by the changes to our co-marketing program. We saw a typical Q3 inventory build ahead of the holiday season, and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at healthy levels. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth with operating income growing 8% from strong core mix, continued improvement in 14-nanometer unit cost and lower spending. The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year. And operating income of $2.3 billion grew 7%. Q3 operating margin was 46%. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in both the comms and cloud service providers segments, which are nearly 60% of our DCG revenue. Overall unit volume was up 4%, ASPs were up 2% and adjacencies grew 16%. We launched Purley in Q3, and in less than 3 months, we've had more than 200 OEM systems begin production shipments. Revenue scale from leadership products and spending leverage and efficiency drove strong operating income growth for the business. We expect DCG to meet our full year expectations of high single-digit growth and operating margin percent in the low 40s. The IoT, NSG and PSG business segments are becoming a larger component of our overall business, growing 25% year-over-year. Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $849 million, up 23% year-over-year, driven by strength in industrial and video and continued momentum in our retail business. Operating profit was $146 million, down 24% year-over-year from continued investments in the automotive segment. We closed the Mobileye transaction early August, 4 months sooner than we expected. The Mobileye team executed extremely well in the third quarter and exceeded our expectations with $82 million in revenue and $39 million in operating income. Going forward, results for the Mobileye acquisition will be included in our all other segment. Increases in spending in this segment will correspond with reductions in the IoTG segment as we realize cost synergies from this acquisition. Our memory business had record revenue of $891 million, up 37% year-over-year, with strong demand from data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. This segment had an operating loss of $52 million, an improvement of $82 million versus last year. Our memory fab in Dalian continues to make great progress. Yields continue to improve and unit costs are well ahead of expectations. The core NAND business continues to be profitable, and we expect the memory business as a whole to be profitable in 2018, both ahead of our prior estimates. The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $469 million, up 10% year-over-year, driven by strength in advanced products, data center, automotive and military. Operating profit was $113 million, up 45% year-over-year. We're making good progress in realizing cost synergies with the integration of this business. Moving to Slide 8. Our cash position of $17.5 billion at September 30 is basically unchanged from the beginning of the year, but we've had lots of moving pieces during the year. First, we have generated $7.2 billion in free cash flow year-to-date. And we've returned $7.4 billion to shareholders through the form of dividends of $3.8 billion and share repurchases of $3.6 billion, including $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, in the quarter. Second, as we mentioned earlier, we closed Mobileye in the third quarter for $14.5 billion in cash and funded over 50% of the purchase price from the sale of noncore assets during the year, including McAfee and the sale of ASML shares. Earlier in the year, we received $924 million from the sale of 51% stake in McAfee. And in the quarter, McAfee re- (technical difficulty) notes of $2.2 billion and issued a dividend of $735 million. Third, we expect to generate $1.5 billion to $2 billion more free cash flow versus where we were at the beginning of the year. The additional free cash flow is driven by higher earnings, lower CapEx, customer prepayments on supply agreements, partially offset by increases to working capital associated with stronger growth and NSG and modem momentum. Based on these factors, we're raising our full year revenue guidance by $700 million to $62 billion, operating income guidance by $900 million to $18.8 billion; and EPS guidance by $0.25 to $3.25 per share. The improvement in revenue outlook is primarily driven by higher expectations of the PC business and continued momentum in memory. The improvement in operating margin is primarily driven by our increased revenue outlook and lower spending. The increase in EPS is driven by higher expectations of revenue, coupled with gains on the sale of our equity investments. And on Slide 11 as we look to the fourth quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $16.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year, excluding McAfee. We expect operating income of $5.2 billion, with gross margins flat year-over-year and spending as a percentage of revenue to be down approximately 2 points. We expect EPS at $0.86 driven by operating margin expansion and higher revenue. 2017 is shaping up to be a record year for Intel. We feel great about where we are 9 months into our 3-year transformation. Since January, we have raised our revenue outlook by $2.5 billion, our operating income by $1.7 billion and our EPS by $0.45. At the same time, we are investing to compete and win in an expanded market. Our PC-centric team continues to operate very well in a down market. And our data-centric businesses are up double digits collectively, as we continue to transform the company to power the cloud and smart connected devices. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark. Okay. Thank you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","Sure, Ross. So let's talk about this. We can kind of break this down. So first, we are already seeing the benefits of AI in that number -- as I said, we lead in inference, which is the actual application of artificial intelligence, and we're continuing to really grow in that space. I think AI, if you take look at, in general, machine learning, it's the smallest segment or workload, if you look at the data center, but the fastest growing. So you're going to see it continue to become a bigger and bigger portion of our business. You're seeing the effects in our numbers already around Xeon, Xeon Scalable, the FPGAs. We talked about Microsoft Brainwave's launch that's occurring. So those products, you're going to see, I'll call those more of our traditional products. And also at the lower end outside the data center, things like Movidius and now Mobileye, you're seeing those hit our P&L as well real-time now as we speak. The other products like Nervana, you'll start to see really more towards the back end probably of 2018 from a P&L perspective. If you take a look at Nervana, it actually -- we get our first silicon out. It will be handed out as test silicons. We have a yearly cadence of products. And so I expect the first instantiations to be more people, figuring out how to use it. It won't be a big impact. But as we go through next year and move on beyond that and get the second generation and beyond, that will grow, we believe, quite considerably. And then products like Loihi, which is our neuromorphic, are same thing. That part we put out so far is really a chip for people to begin to use and learn how to program with neuromorphic, which is a very different type of machine learning. It lets you learn at hundreds of times faster rate than traditional, I'll say, GPUs and CPUs, especially around visual learning. Those as well, you'll start to see next -- late next year and beyond, as people really begin to learn how to program with these. So seeing it already and those newer products, I really think late '18 and beyond before they really start to hit P&Ls. Yes, Ross, great question. First, as you mentioned, we had great progress in the third quarter. We kind of started the year at a spending level which was a little over 35% of revenue. And we came into 2017 saying that we would get that down to roughly 34%. Reflected in our guidance is it will be closer to 33%. So we're delivering well ahead of our expectations, which have been a function of the 2 things you highlighted: one, much stronger growth; and two, lower spending levels. And those lower spending levels from the first half of this year to the second half are a function of continuing to look at every dollar that we spend, whether it's R&D, whether it sales and marketing, or whether it's G&A and making sure that those dollars are allocated towards the biggest growth opportunities. And we're not to redeploy that capital or to get it out of the ecosystem. So our first half to second half spend levels will be down roughly $700 million on a business that will be roughly $2.5 billion bigger in the second half versus the first half. So we're making great progress and making real trade-offs on our spending levels and getting the benefit of stronger growth. And we expect the combination of those 2 to continue as we go forward. So I'll start and Bob can jump in, Stacy. First, because you've kind of got a couple of questions in there, the way I would tell you is that the Purley ramp has just really started. It starts with the big comm service providers. You saw Google talk about it a couple of weeks ago. You saw Microsoft talk about it earlier this week. Those ramps are just beginning. I talked about the 200 design wins or design-ins at customers. Those are starting to come out. So we are really early. These ramps, remember because we have to -- it will go through the cloud service providers and then the Tier 2 cloud service provider, then on into comms and eventually into enterprise as well. This is going to be -- take a year or more. So it's -- I think it's early to make this judgment. The ramp's right within the range we predicted it to be from a ramp of that product. Your second part of your question is 7% high single digits. I will just make it simple and say, look, if you look, mathematically, I think it would meet a minima of high single digits, but it's certainly not necessarily where we're targeting to get to, but it's a high single-digit number. I'm not going to -- the math doesn't lie. Just to maybe add a little bit, I think the first part of your question, overall growth for the year relative to the expectations back in January, revenue will be up $2.5 billion. Obviously, PC is a significant part of that. Memory is growing faster. IoT is growing faster. PSG and data center -- PSG faster in the second half versus the first half, and DCG in line with our full year outlook at the beginning of the year to be high single digits. So real good strength on clients, on memory, on IoT and in line with the other businesses. The other thing I would just offer to -- follow up on Brian's commentary on DCG growth -- maybe 2 things. One, we started out at 6% in Q1. We were at 9% in Q2. We're at 7% in Q3 off a real tough comp last year of double-digit growth in the third quarter. So I would say from a top line perspective, we're right in line with kind of the guide that we gave at the end of the year. And secondly and as importantly, our operating margins has continued to grow significantly quarter-on-quarter through the course of the year, with 46% operating margins in the third quarter. And we told you early on despite a relatively slow start, we expect that operating margin for DCG to be above 40% for the year, and we're well on track to hit that important metric as well. So 9 months through the year, a great start to the year for us, and DCG in line with our expectations and building momentum as we exit the year. Yes. On your first part, we laid out for the year 63% gross margins, and we're pretty much in line with that throughout the first -- in the first 9 months. And our outlook for Q4 is another 63%. So in line with kind of full year outlook, which is in the high end of our historical guide range. So we feel pretty good about where we are. And for the dynamics underneath the covers, the trends have been very consistent, volume leverage with good scale going through the fabs. ASPs modestly better, much better in the first half on easier comps, slightly better in the second half on tougher comps. Unit costs continues to come down. The ramp costs associated with 10-nanometer are lower. And offsetting those, you really have 3 things going on. One, we have a high growth in our adjacent businesses, memory and modem, that weigh on -- that are a big contributor to improved earnings, but they weigh on our gross margin. Secondly, we have higher engineering samples in the -- as we go into the fourth quarter. And third, the co-marketing change that we -- that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Stacy, that has no impact in operating income, but a modest impact on gross margin, but offset by lower spending levels. So you take those all into account, and they have delivered solid Q3 dynamics, solid Q4 outlook. And the one change between Q3 and Q4 is primarily attributable to the mix of the higher growth adjacency businesses. Those trends and those dynamics, we'll talk much more about 2018 in January, but those trends have been fairly consistent for the last 4 quarters. Bob, I just wanted to go back to some of the comments you made. In DCG, op margin was up a ton. It's actually above your kind of full year. So just kind of curious where those cuts came from. And then as you look forward, I know you're not going to forecast for next year. But is there any reason why the spending will go up and down from here? Yes. The first half gross margin -- I should say operating margins were lower, second half much stronger. Fundamentally, it's less about cuts, to be honest with you. It's more about continuing to grow the top line, continuing to get ASP improvements or compensated for the performance that we're delivering; modestly -- and modestly lower unit costs. So the combination of those 3 are getting really good leverage and allow us to expand operating margins while we continue to invest in obviously Xeon, but also in artificial intelligence. So that's what's driven the kind of first half to second half dynamics. And as I indicated, we kind of started out the year saying that we were highly confident we'd be above 40 for the year. And that's kind of how it's played out during the course of the year. Great. And then I wanted to go back to a question on AI and inference. Brian, I was wondering if you just comment on today -- I think you said it was small. Just curious, out of the cloud spend, how much is inference today? And when you look at future workloads driving server units, where could that be in a couple of years? Sure. We don't separate out inference. So we -- what we said is simply in the past publicly that AI is -- one of the smallest workloads, but one of the fastest growing. We haven't broken out. We don't -- beyond just saying there's -- here's what cloud is growing at and here's what comms and here's what enterprises, we don't break out by workloads. And there's a variety of reasons for that. Part of it is it's sometimes hard. The mixture of what -- when somebody goes out and build a rack, what is it going into, how much of its workload is really being used by AI is -- anybody who tells you exactly what that number is, is just wrong, to be honest with you. So it's hard for us to say with precision, x percent of our units went into AI workloads, because it's rare that a rack is purely AI except for in rare cases. But we know that's it's small, despite the type of interactions we have, but also fast growing and one of the biggest areas of interest. No onetimers. It's in one sense, John, it's no real surprises for us. We anticipated growing throughout the year. We anticipated higher ASPs, i.e., sequentially ASPs being a little bit stronger, and that would drive incremental operating income. And some of the benefits, just a lower overall G&A spending for the company is benefiting all the different P&Ls that G&A is actually lower. So that's what's really been driving the improvement sequentially. And as you can tell from our full year guide, there'll be more of the same in Q4 relative to Q3. And then we'll, in terms of implications going forward, we got a great business. We've redefined the role we play in the data center business to be a not high 90% share player, but a 30% share player with lots of room to grow. And we expect that to be a continued important source of growth, both top and bottom line for the company. The specifics around that, we'll talk more about it in January. Sure. So you've captured that quite well, right? Let's just talk about there -- we can talk about it from a unit standpoint and then we can talk about it from how has our business done. From a unit standpoint, the decline has certainly slowed down, right? We -- if you go back a year or 2 ago, we were high single digits to low teens declines at times year-over-year from a unit basis. And that slowed into the low single digits that we're seeing today, but we still are seeing a decline on a unit level. And I always remind people, we've taken probably something like 25% of the annual units out of this business, yet grown in that time frame the profitability of that business significantly. So that I think just talks about both the great execution in products and segmentation strategy and just the leadership that, that team, at first with Navin Shenoy and now with Greg Bryant, have really delivered to the company. So our view is, John, that if you take a long-term view, we see the pattern kind of stabilizing at about where it is. I think we'll come in here, and there'll be quarters when the units are up slightly, and there'll be quarters when the units are down a little more slightly. But when we looked at it over the long haul, they're probably going to be down, those low single digits. But we also see segments that are growing that are very performance-focused, which allow us opportunities. So you talked about gaming, 2-in-1 devices, thin and light, the Ultrabook, as we like to think about it from the old. Those products are continuing to see growth actually. And they are pushing that record Core i5, i7. They're pushing the desire for Core i9, which is a new product that we introduced, right? Those are what's driving the segmentation, the ASP uplift and the increased profitability. We think to some level, that trend will continue. How long, I -- I'm not going to be that good of a prognosticator, but certainly for the near-term future, we don't see this trend shifting very much. Yes. I'm excited about the modem business. We -- we've I think really gotten a team together that is world-class. We believe we now are on a yearly cadence of world-class modems, which is really critical. That's a big hurdle to get that technology to where you can reliably put out a yearly cadence, a world-class modem. We believe we're there now. We continue to increase the profitability or the efficiency of that organization, which we've always talked about in the past, and that's continued. So we think we can continue to both drive the technology and continue to grow that business. Great EPS growth. I -- Bob, I think some of us who are more on the optimistic side definitely see a path to $4 of EPS, which makes look -- makes Intel look compelling. I think some of the pushback, though, has been among value investors who look at free cash flow. In this year for example, even with the equity gains, it looks like free cash flow is tracking down. So I know that this is an investment year, but how should people be thinking about free cash flow growth relative to EPS growth next year and maybe even 2019 as well? Yes, the -- first in 2017, people ought to be thinking about free cash flow growth being $1.5 billion to $2 billion higher than what we -- what was primarily reflected in our guidance. Because we're saying that our current forecast is -- will be much better than kind of where we started the year. And that improvement is really a function of 3 things: one, earnings growth, more operating earnings growth as opposed to the ICAP gains, but real solid operating earnings growth; secondly, we reduced our CapEx outlook for the year from $12 billion to $11.5 billion this year; and third, we -- the long-term agreements that we signed in the year. One of the benefits on what we're trying to do is really match our net capital deployed in memory in conjunction with demand from strategic clients and partners, which has the effect of reducing the impact of the memory capital intensity on the free cash flows of the business that makes sense for our customers and makes sense for us. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities. The biggest gap between our earnings performance and our free cash flow performance has been the higher capital associated with growth, number one, but in particular, memory. And we're really looking for opportunities to reduce our net capital deployed into memory, which in turn will grow free cash flow over time, just closer and closer to our EPS growth. And I guess along those lines, Brian, can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about CapEx at these levels and going forward? Sure. What -- I think in our statements and in the release, we showed you that we actually lowered CapEx to -- by about $500 million for this year. We've talked about CapEx and thinking about it kind of being in this range. I don't think we have anything else to say about it. It's pretty close. Right now, we're just focused on the execution into Q4 and prepping for our views into 2018. So I don't want to have any other discussion on CapEx until we get to the January time frame right now for 2018. Yes, I would just, without giving you all the specifics of ASPs by segment, I would just say the biggest driver of ASP improvement is really incremental performance. So as we continue to transition -- we're still transitioning Haswell to Broadwell, which all else equal, there is positive ASP implications as we transition to Xeon Scalable and deliver higher performance. That growing mix of higher performance products is the single biggest contributor to ASP. We're still in the early days, as Brian mentioned in Xeon Scalable, but that is a higher performance product. And we would expect that will share in the benefits of high performance for our clients with higher ASPs, but that's the biggest dynamic. Yes, think of it, so first, absolutely, you're right that we are going to move much more of our focus towards data center products coming first. It's not going to be the early part of the 10-nanometer, though. It just -- you got to look at the design cycles. And you make a decision like that, even you make it last year. You'll start to see the effect of the back end of 10-nanometers, and you'll really see it affect, 7-nanometers. So not these early products on 10, no. They were already in the hopper when we made that move. Yes, just on the co-marketing program in particular, this is really what we're trying to do is retain the value of the Intel Inside brand, but also to be more flexible and to kind of align our spending in conjunction with our customers -- more tailored programs by customer to drive more efficient demand. That's the intent of what we're trying to accomplish. And we're pretty excited about the change. The quantification of that strategy, in essence in the third quarter, was roughly $200 million that, in essence, shifted from spending to contra revenue. So no impact on operating income dollars, but roughly $200 million lower revenue, $200 million lower spending. And we expect that to be modestly higher as we go into the fourth quarter. So again, more effective and efficient way to spend our marketing dollars in conjunction with tailoring programs for -- with the OEMs. That drives a change in the geography of how those dollars were reflected in our P&L, but doesn't really impact our operating income. Sure. That's a great question. So we kind of mentioned that even out of those 14, many of those continue on up into Level 3, Level 4. The Level 5 work that you see out there is pretty far out there. And I'll tell you that's -- there's a lot of just kind of experimental work going on there. If I take a look at though kind of a bigger picture, which is what you're asking is, this whole picture that we've been putting together is, I kind of said in the statement that, individually, these businesses are great. But when you pull these together into one package and you're able to walk into a customer with a complete solution, they're truly world-class and something nobody else can deliver. So you're right, when we go into and we talk to somebody about autonomous driving in general, whether it's Level 2 plus, Level 3, Level 4, Level 5, we bring with us a suite of products, depending on what kind of architecture. And they're -- what we're seeing is different OEMs, different customers thinking about those architectures even differently across that spectrum. Some are thinking, ""Well, by Level 5, I think my skills will be up. I want a closed system. I want to have much more of the control of the software."" So we have a set of solutions we bring to them there. Some of them want to have more FPGAs for how they bring their software down onto the silicon earlier on. But what we're able to do is bring our modems. We shipped -- and we mentioned it in the release that -- our first automotive modem. So we're able to bring automotive modems all the way through 5G. Most of these car companies are having to build data centers. And not just data centers, centralized data centers, but really a data center kind of architecture that goes all the way out with data and compute at the edge. You're going to want to be able to manipulate and transfer mapping, high-precision mapping to the cars and data back from the cars to change those maps, construction and things like that. So we're building that architecture. And we have the products and the talent to uniquely work with them all through that infrastructure. And then you get out to the car again and we can bring the FPGA, the Mobileye for center fusion or compute. We can put Xeons in there. And so we -- in each one of these discussions, they're all a bit different. They all have multiple phases as you go to 3, 4 and 5 on the levels. And what we're able to do is say you don't just have to take this one solution. This is not the only solution there is. What would you like to do? What best solves your problem in the most cost-effective lower -- lowest power efficient way? How much work do you want us to do in software development versus how much work do you want to own and have IP within your company? And that's changing, as we said, over time. And that's part of also why we're building out that 100-car fleet. Amnon has really has driven a vision that says it's one thing to bring foils to a meeting. It's another thing to bring a car and say now let's go out and drive, and show you how all of these fit together. And so all of that is -- this package that we have is unique, and it's resonating quite well as we walk into the various car OEMs. And I'm out there with them in various modes almost every week, every other week. Amnon's out. We're all talking about a complete package.","BK, a longer-term one for you. You rattled off a number of AI advancements that Intel is having, whether it be on the Nervana side or the Stratix side. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment in there? You mentioned that it's not going to be one size fit all -- fits all. But if you could give a little bit of how Intel does have an advantage versus some of the early movers in that space? And then perhaps more importantly, when will we, externally as investors, be able to start to see the financial benefits of these new products? Great. And then the follow-up question I had was actually for Bob, and it's on the OpEx side. And congrats on the great operating leverage in the quarter. As we think about the way you can get that operating leverage in the past, Intel seems to have focused mainly on keeping the OpEx relatively flat, and then revenue growth driving that leverage. But in the quarter and then the guide that you just delivered, it looks like OpEx is down about 6% year-over-year. Conceptually, as we go into the next couple of years, how do you think investors should think about the balance of delivering that cadence up to the 30% mark that you're looking for over the next couple of years? Is it more revenue growth? Or you are you indeed going to be cutting the absolute level of OpEx? First, I wanted to ask a little bit about the revenue drivers, revenue upside for the year and I guess margin up for 3 quarters. But it continues to look to be the same trend, almost entirely from PC and memory. In the meantime, I mean this is, in your words, your biggest server refresh in a decade, and we're not seeing any upside. We're doing 7% year-over-year pretty much for the full year, which I guess I would classify as barely high single digit. We're not really seeing meaningful ASP increases from mix as Purley. I was wondering if you could just kind of give us a view on, I guess, your expectations for data center, where it's coming in, why we're not seeing more upside from the Purley ramp versus what we've seen from prior platform introductions, and whether or not 7% actually would qualify as high single digits by your definition. Did you have a follow-up, Stacy? I do. I want to ask about gross margins really quick. So revenue was up 0.6%. I guess, year-over-year, excluding McAfee. Gross margins are down like 90 bps year-over-year. I was wondering -- I was hoping you could give us some color on the drivers of that shift. And in particular, how should we think about the trajectory exiting the year into 2018, puts and takes on gross margins as we go into next year and given what we've seen this year? Bob, maybe I can just ask Blayne's DCG op margin question a little bit differently. In the calendar third quarter, you actually I think had revenue up about $500 million sequentially in that business roughly, and operating profits grew by about $600 million sequentially. Can you just help us understand what drove that dynamic? Where there any onetimes? And just given how strong the operating margin is, I know you've reaffirmed for the full year. But is the Q3 level the new sort of norm we should start basing operating profit off of? Or was there something specific in Q3 that drove the op margin leverage above 100% sequentially? That's helpful. Maybe for my follow-up for Brian, Brian, I know this is not a big part of your growth strategy going forward. But as you mentioned in your prepared comments, CCG is still very important to scale advantages, to profitability, to free cash flow, to your ability to invest in growth markets. And that's been a business that's been sort of remarkably stable over the last 4 or 5 quarters. It's grown over the last couple of years, in part because we've had relatively easy compares in the PC market. So I'm kind of curious as you think about this business over the next, call it 4 to 8 quarters, how are you guys thinking about the corporate upgrade cycle or refresh cycle on PCs, the consumer refresh cycle, the gaming market, and I guess importantly, the modem business, which is becoming a bigger and bigger part of this business over time? Do you think you can still keep this business sort of on a flat growth trajectory? Or how are you thinking about it? And then Brian, just on the modem side, in your prepared comments, I think you said it was up 37% year-over-year. What's the sustainability of that business and your ability to kind of continue to grow that business through penetration? On the ASP trend in DCG was up 2% year-over-year, but it can be skewed by mix. So if we look at the 4 subsegments, cloud, comm service provider, enterprise, adjacencies, if you just look at those buckets as a silo as you ramp Skylake, did ASPs move higher in all of those subsegments? I'm just trying to get a sense for how broad-based the value capture was. Great. And the team has talked about accelerating the server road maps to be more closely aligned with the cadence of manufacturing technology migrations, I believe starting with the 10-nanometer nodes. Can you guys just give us an update there? Bob, I wouldn't -- I wanted to ask a little bit about G&A leverage. You talked about in the script and in some of the Q&A here, some changes to the co-marketing programs and the like going forward in both the PC and the data center business. Is there any way you could maybe bound for us the size of those and their contributions to what the run rate has been of overall OpEx, and what kind of opportunities there are potentially to further restructure those going forward? That's really helpful. And then as a follow-up, Brian, in automotive space, I think you mentioned 14 ADAS wins from Mobileye versus 12 of all last year. And that's sort of in the ADAS space, and you have some of your competitors making quite bold announcements about wins towards autonomous driving programs long term. Maybe you could talk about how commitments are being made in ADAS versus autonomous, and then how the acquisition that you've seen so far of Mobileye has maybe pulled some of your computing assets into these conversations for longer term with autonomous? Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Matt. And thank you all for joining us today. Operator, please go ahead and wrap up the call.

INTC,Q1 2018,2856,4169,1293,"Thank you, operator. And welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO earnings presentation that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The CFO earnings presentation is also available on the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. Thanks, Mark. Coming off a record 2017, 2018 is off to an exceptionally strong start. Q1 was Intel's best first quarter ever and significantly exceeded the expectations we set in January. Our Client Computing Group continue to execute well, producing growth within a declining PC market. And our transformation to a data-centric company accelerated with our data-centric businesses, booting McAfee up 25% over the first quarter of last year. The strength of Intel's business underscores my confidence in our strategy. What we're seeing is an unrelenting demand for compute performance driven by the continuing growth of data and the need to process, analyze, store and share that data. That dynamic benefits our traditional CPU business and it reinforces the big bets we've made in memory, modems, FPGAs and autonomous vehicles. We're competing to win in our largest collection of addressable markets ever. And importantly, we're not just competing in these markets. We're leading and shaping them as our first quarter results demonstrate. Data Center Group revenue was up 24% year-over-year. We saw broad-based demand strength across all DCG segments in Q1. And customer preference for high performance products, including Xeon Scalable drove a richer ASP mix. The cloud segment grew 45%. And in the comm service provider segment, we continue to take share and grew revenue 33% as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks as the industry prepares for the 5G transition. Intel's presence at the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang was a powerful showcase of our 5G capability. Intel and KT deployed the world's largest 5G network to date, including more than 20 5G links delivering 3,800 terabytes of network capacity. We've established leadership in 5G. And when commercial networks begin deploying around 2019, we'll be there with industry-leading products from the core of the data center to the edge to mobile devices. And we also saw growth in our enterprise segments for the second consecutive quarter as macro strength continued and customers prioritized hybrid and on-premises infrastructure investments. Data center customers are also looking to FPGAs for workload acceleration. The Programmable Solutions Group again set a record for design win volume, and those design wins are translating directly into revenue. PSG's business grew 17% in Q1 on data center and embedded strength along with last time buys. PSG's data center segment was up 150% over last year, and the Advanced products category, our 28-, 20- and 14-nanometer solutions grew more than 40%. Microsoft also recently announced that they're using Intel's FPGAs to power new Bing intelligent search features using real-time AI. PSG's momentum is evidence that our 2016 acquisition of Altera is delivering value for our customers and contributing directly to Intel's growth. Our IoTG business grew 17% on record unit volume with continuing momentum in the retail and video segment as compute increasingly moves to the edge. Consistent with our commitment to be disciplined with our resources, we made the decision to divest Wind River and sharpen the focus of IoTG on other growth opportunities that more closely align to our strategy. The memory business set a revenue record, growing 20% in the first quarter, crossing over the $1 billion mark in revenue. The last business that passed that mark was DCG, crossing over that mark over a decade ago. Both yields and output in our Dalian factory continue to ramp ahead of schedule. In fact, we believe the Dalian Fab extension is one of the fastest brownfield of wafer starts projects in memory industry history. We also launched our first mainstream Optane SSDs for clients, known as the 800 series, driving further industry adoption of this revolutionary technology. The NSG remains on track to be profitable for the full year. And we continue to demonstrate momentum in autonomous driving, and I'm happy to report that the Intel Mobileye autonomous vehicle test fleet has begun to operate in Israel and will expand to other geographies in the coming months. Our fleet fully implements the Responsible Sensitive Safety system or RSS that we introduced last year. This unique system applies a formal, common sense safety field to the vehicle's decision making, resulting in the optimal combination of provable safety and humanlike driving style. We believe that the winning path to autonomous driving will be a progression from ADAS capabilities to full autonomous driving. And we're seeing significant momentum in the marketplace, including a recent high-volume design win for EyeQ5 with a European premium vehicle manufacturer. And finally, the Client Computing Group extended its strong track record of execution in a challenging PC environment. The revenue was up 3% despite a declining PC TAM on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments, leading to a strong core mix. The CCG launched its first ever i9 processors for laptops in the first quarter, again demonstrating our outright product leadership. We continue to make progress on our 10-nanometer process. We are shipping in low volume and yields are improving, so the rate of improvement is slower than we anticipated. As a result, volume production is moving from the second half of 2018 into 2019. We understand the yield issues and have defined improvements for them, but they will take time to implement and qualify. We have leadership products on the road map that continue to take advantage of 14-nanometer with Whiskey Lake for Client and Cascade Lake for the data center coming later this year. Moore's Law is essential to our strategy and our product leadership. It continues to create significant value for Intel and our customers. While it's taking longer and costing more to deliver and yield advanced process technologies, we are able to optimize our process and products within a node to deliver meaningful performance improvements. For example, 14-nanometer process optimizations and architectural improvements have resulted in performance gains of more than 70% since the first 14-nanometer products were launched. We combined these advances in manufacturing technology and architecture that produced truly a leadership product, and it's that product leadership that ultimately matters most to our customers and end users. Intel and the industry stepped up for a tough challenge as we responded to the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. I'm pleased with our progress and proud of how Intel and industry partners address this issue collaboratively, with transparency and with customer-first urgency. We're delivering against our security-first pledge and we've now rolled out micro code-based mitigation for all Intel products launched over the last 9 years that require protection against Spectre and Meltdown. We'll also begin delivering both client and data center products with the hardware-based mitigations later this year. With our Data centric transformation accelerating, we're raising our expectations for our full year results, yet more evidence that our strategy is working. As Intel marks its 50th anniversary, we're well positioned to be the end-to-end platform provider for the new data world and the leader in artificial intelligence and the autonomous revolution. With that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Brian. Q1 was truly an outstanding start to 2018. Our transformation to a data-centric company continues to build momentum. Revenue was a first quarter record of $16.1 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Operating income was $4.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year. And EPS of $0.87 was up 32% year-over-year. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividend. As a result of the strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full year revenue guide by $2.5 billion to $67.5 billion. We're raising our EPS guide by $0.30 to $3.85. And we're raising our free cash flow guide by $1.5 billion to $14.5 billion. Our Q1 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Intel's data-centric businesses were up 25% collectively with each business individually growing double digits. Our data-centric businesses are now approaching 50% of our revenue, an all-time high. Our PC-centric business was up 3% on strength in notebook, desktop and modem. DCG strong cash flows fund Intel's investment in new data-centric growth. As a reminder, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard in Q1. The new standard drove $462 million in incremental Q1 revenue recognition. This predominantly affected CCG and NSG. By year-end, we expect roughly half of this to net out. Moving to Q1 earnings. We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, up 32% year-on-year. Our non-GAAP EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth, a 3-point improvement in operating margins and an 11-point reduction in our effective tax rate. The 3-point improvement in operating margins were driven by a 4-point reduction in spending, partially offset by a 1 point decline in gross margin. The 1 point decline in gross margin was driven by growth in our adjacencies, which have lower gross margins than our CPU products. From a spending standpoint, versus last year, we delivered $1.3 billion more revenue on $200 million less spending. As a second reminder, we adopted a new mark-to-market standard for our equity investments. In 2017, all realized gains and losses were recorded in our non-GAAP results. But in 2018, all mark-to-market adjustments flow through earnings. In an effort to eliminate volatility, we have excluded these adjustments from our non-GAAP results. Our Q1 GAAP EPS included approximately $0.13 for mark-to-market gains in our ICAP portfolio that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. We are also making excellent progress in our operating efficiencies. In January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal from 2020 to 2019, and we're off to a good start in 2018. Total spending was down 4% year-over-year in the quarter. R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was down approximately 2 points. And our SG&A costs were down over 2 points. Our intensity on spending is designed to accelerate top line growth, and it is paying off. Currently, as a result of strong top line growth, we now expect to meet our 30% spending target in 2018, 2 years ahead of our original expectations. Let me touch briefly on our Q1 performance by segment. The Data Center Group delivered a great quarter, much better than expected. DCG revenue of $5.2 billion was up 24% year-over-year, and operating income of $2.6 billion grew 75%. Q1 operating margin was 50%. Overall, unit volume was up 16%, and ASPs were up 7%. We saw broad-based demand strength in Q1 with customer preference for high-performance products driving richer ASPs. Cloud and comms service providers segments were greater than 60% of the data center business. And this was the first quarter our cloud business has surpassed $2 billion in revenue, which made it our largest segment in the first quarter. Additionally, we redefined our expanded TAM for DCG to markets beyond the CPU, like silicon photonics, Fabric, network ASICs and 3D XPoint memory. These adjacent businesses are gaining traction and grew 16% year-over-year. DCG performance in all segments was better than our January forecast, and we expect that strength to continue to aid DCG momentum through the second quarter. Our additional data-centric businesses, IoTG, NSG and PSG, are becoming a larger component of our overall business, growing 18% year-over-year in the quarter. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $840 million, growing 17% year-over-year, driven by strength in video and continued momentum in retail. Operating profit was $227 million, up 116% year-over-year on higher revenue and lower spending as we shifted our ADAS investments to Mobileye. As you heard from Brian, the Mobileye business is going strong. Q1 revenue was $151 million. And while it's early in the journey, we are on track to our deal thesis. Our memory business broke the $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, up 20% year-over-year with strong demand for data center SSD solutions. We reduced our operating losses by $48 million with strong gigabyte demand and unit cost reductions more than offsetting ASP reductions. The transition to 64 3D NAND is improving our cost while we invest in and expand our Dalian factory. We expect the second half of '18 to be balanced between supply and demand, and we continue to expect this segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018. The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $498 million with 17% growth, driven by strength in data center and the embedded segments. Operating profit was $97 million, up 5% year-over-year. The PSG team continues to perform and execute well. Our advanced FPGA products, those at 28-, 20- and 14-nanometer, grew over 40% in the quarter. In fact, PSG won more customer designs in Q1 than in any prior quarter. Finally, the Client Computing Group had another strong quarter. Revenues of $8.2 billion were up 3%, and operating margins were down 4 points due to 10-nanometer transition cost and growth in our modem business. Our PC-centric business continues to perform well in a challenging but improving market and serves as a significant source of cash flow for the company. We saw strength in the commercial and gaming businesses, and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at healthy levels. We've laid out our capital allocation priorities: invest organically, expand acquisitively and return capital to our shareholders, and do it wisely. We continue to execute to these priorities. We generated $6.3 billion in cash from operations. This included $1.7 billion in cash received from NAND customer supply agreement. We invested $2.9 billion in CapEx and delivered $3.4 billion in free cash flow, up 73% year-over-year. We returned almost 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of $1.9 billion in buybacks and $1.4 billion in dividends, a 10% increase per share over last year. Now moving to our full year outlook. Our strategy is working, and our investments are paying off. We are now forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $67.5 billion, up $2.5 billion versus our expectations in January. We expect operating margin of approximately 31%, up 1 point from January as spending as a percent of revenue drops to approximately 30%. Versus prior estimates, gross margin will be approximately flat as broad-based strength in our business is offset by the higher cost associated with the 10-nanometer volume production shift to 2019. We now expect a full year tax rate of 13%, 1 point down versus our prior estimate. Overall, stronger top line growth, improved operating margins and a lower tax rate will boost EPS to $3.85, up $0.30 versus prior estimate. From a cash flow perspective, we are increasing our free cash flow to $14.5 billion, up $1.5 billion from January. We now expect net capital deployed of approximately $12.5 billion, up $500 million versus the expectations we set in January. This reflects gross CapEx of approximately $14.5 billion offset by approximately $2 billion of customer prepayments for memory supply agreement. In Q2, we expect strong growth to continue. We are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $16.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. We expect operating margin of approximately 30%, up 1 point versus last year, which reflects approximately 1.5 point decrease in gross margin and a 2.5 to 3-point decline in spending. We expect EPS of $0.85, up 31% excluding equity adjustments from strong top line growth, spending reductions and a lower tax rate. To sum it up, we believe 2018 will be another record year for Intel. We've met and exceeded our financial commitments, and we feel great about where we are relative to our 3-year plan. Our PC-centric team keeps winning in a challenging market, and our data-centric businesses are growing fast, fueling Intel's transformation to a company that powers the cloud in smart connected devices. With that, let me turn it over to Mark, and we'll get to your questions. All right. Thank you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","Sure, Ross. That's a good question. Let me try and answer it. So first thing I'll tell you is that there is a bit here that is the transition to cloud continues to occur, occurring at a bit even faster rate so that -- you do see that trend is going on. But remember, we've always talked about that over the long haul, you have to look at these, it can sometimes be lumpy. So our forecast for the long term is still in that high teens, low 20s kind of range for that kind of growth. We thought that we -- the enterprise is clearly up. We think that -- as you said that a lot of that is reinvigoration of investments by companies in on-site data. Our view of long term there, I look out over the long term again, it's still -- that should be in a declining mode versus moving those workloads long term over to the cloud. So if I take a look at this, as Bob said in his prepared remarks, so we look at -- if I look at our data-centric businesses in general, so even just beyond the data center, we see these growing in that mid- to high teens range. And that's kind of how we view this. And we do believe that is sustainable. And it will move from cloud to enterprise. And sometimes, you'll see IoT pick up a bit, offset something, but that's why we grouped those into that data centric. But they're all really tied together. It's data coming from the edge, moving through the network into the data center and really being based in the cloud and analytics being applied to it and people using that data then to make decisions to drive businesses. So we think it's sustainable in kind of the data-centric numbers that you saw. But it will float between those various segments. The only thing, Ross, that I would add is in terms of our outlook in the more near term, our outlook for the year is kind of continued strength in the second quarter similar to the first quarter. And -- but beyond that, it's probably a little cloudier. I think we are benefiting from global macroeconomic environment. I think the higher earning is -- higher earnings and the ability to deduct IT related expenditures, I think is giving CIOs a little more money to spend. And we see ourselves benefiting from that through the first half of the year. Second half is going to be a little bit of a wait and see as to whether the short-term dynamics continue into the second half. But you go back to Brian's comments, I think the -- what we do know is the -- this increased demand for compute data, analytics, storage, rapid retrieval is what's really driving the demand for high performance compute. And not only do we see the unit volume strength but also the ASP strength, which we think is a function of Intel-related products. Sure, Ross. So let me start -- we absolutely have product and process leadership. We're shipping 10-nanometer products today. So I did want to make sure that, that was very clear to you and that was our densest, highest performing product out there. We're slowing the ramp down as we go and fix the yields, and we were able to do that. A, we understand the yield issues. They're really tied to this being the last technology tied to not having EUV and the amount of multi-patterning and the effects of that or defects. But also, the real strengths of 14-nanometers, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've done 70% improvements in the performance of that technology over its current life time. And we believe it continues to have lags that we can continue to make improvement, both within that process technology and architecturally. That's really giving us the breathing room to go and make these yield improvements. So it's really balancing between delivering the world's best product. So we believe our road map for 2018 is strong and stronger than it's ever been. And we have the ability to carry that into 2019, allowing us to get the yields where we want them to be. So the cost and the spending are really in line with what you as a shareholder expect from us. We believe that if you take a look at others during this time frame, if you look at anybody else and said 70% improvement on a technology note, yes, let me rename those nodes as we go through this. And we have always chosen to be really transparent and clean and just say, it's improvements on the existing technology rather than renaming. So we believe we have that. Now as we look at -- out in time, we do see the density. You just take that component, the density gap is narrowing a bit. But that's out in time. But again, performance is really a function of multiple parts of the process around power and performance and in architecture. And that's why we think our products continue to lead and be the world standard. And on the gross margin question, the strong -- both volume and ASP performance in the first quarter contributed to gross margins being 2 points ahead of kind of our expectations at the beginning of the year. So we saw that real good performance on top line flowing through in the first quarter. What we indicated for the full year, though, there's no change in our full year gross margin. That essentially is a function of continued volume and ASP strength but partially offset by yields that are improving, but not quite at the rate that we had anticipated on 10-nanometer. And secondly, our cost associated with -- we expected, at the end of the year, that we'll have pre-PRQ reserves that will be a little bit higher as we shift into 2019. So strong first quarter, strong for the full year, but those 10-nanometer costs will be a little bit of a drag. We step back, we still look at kind of gross margins for the full year that are at the high end of kind of our historical range in the 60% to 65% range, which is good. And for us, that's despite the fact that we're getting really solid growth from our lower margin, but earnings-accretive businesses like modem and memory. So I'm just going to correct you. You said that supposedly, we have the solutions. We do understand these things. So we do have confidence that we can go and work these issues, Stacy. Right now, as I said, we are shipping. We're going to start that ramp as soon as we think the yields are in line. So as I said, 2019. We didn't say first or second half, although we'll do it as quickly as we can based on the yield. And the last part of your question about whether -- will it be a 10 or a 10++ or a 10-plus, I think, was your question, these -- the yield improvements that we're making are just that, more focused on yield. So think of them as improvements to the various etch steps and lithography steps and cleans and things like that in order to really drive the multi-patterning and in some cases, the multi multi-patterning where we have 4, 5, 6 layers of patterning to produce a feature. It's really about that. They aren't necessarily around performance. We do have plans on 10-nanometer all ready similar to 14-nanometer, for 10-plus and 10++. And so we think all of these technologies now have multiple years of performance improvement built into them as they come off the floor. First, I'm not -- probably not throw a whole lot in 2019 as we focus on trying to execute what we believe will be an outstanding 2018. But I think there's a few dynamics that we've been wrestling with. As you know, over the last couple of years we've seen a gap between earnings and cash flow, and it's really been driven by a couple of things. One, success and by that, I mean, accelerating rates of growth and the additional capital that goes along with that growth, both CapEx and inventory levels. So those have been one of the drivers. Secondly, we brought on 10-nanometer equipment but haven't necessarily put it to use yet. So that's a cash driver without an impact on earnings. And third, memory is in the investment phase. So those 3 things have really been what's been driving the gap, and we've done a few things in light of that, that you're aware of. One, memory, we engage in the strategic supply agreements that you mentioned, which really for us is a sign that our customers are excited and committed to the technologies that we're building such that we can help -- we can use their money to help fund the scaling of the business. And we think that's a good, positive short, medium and long-term move. And the other thing, just if you think about, Stacy, kind of how we guided this year, you have earnings -- if you don't give us credit for the ICAP gains last year and strip that out, you see earnings growth that's roughly 25%, 26% and you see free cash flow growth that's in the mid-30s. So you'll start to see that gap narrowing as we go through the course of this year. And then the other thing is we're going to make a fairly significant cash tax payment in 2018 as a result of the ICAP gains from last year, and that's roughly $1.2 billion that's going to weigh on our cash flows this year. If you strip that out for a second, what you see during the course of 2018 is roughly 25% earnings growth and roughly 50% free cash flow growth, and that gap begins to narrow while we're accelerating the growth rate of the business. So those are -- that's kind of the dynamics in terms of how we're deploying capital for accelerating top line growth and the improvements on free cash flow relative to earnings per share this year. As we get through the course of 2018, we'll start to shed a little more light on what that means for 2019 later in the year. Sure. So the issues around 10 nanometers, I kind of tried to lay that out without getting too deep into the technology, but this is the last technology with -- that doesn't incorporate EUV. And what you also need to understand is that we took very aggressive goals at 10 nanometers. So if you talk about the scaling factor or think about it as the multiple at which you shrink a feature, okay, we took a target of 2.7. So you took any feature and 1 over 2.7 is the dimensional shrink that you get to this device. For example, on 14 nanometers, we took a target of 2.4. So you're almost 10% more aggressive on 10 nanometers. And if you look at what more is the industry standard, what the foundries and other players are typically doing, they're typically in that 1.5 to 2.0 range. So they're -- we're maybe 20% more aggressive. So we took very aggressive goals to hit our cost targets and where we want the technology to be. And that, combined with end-of-life of emergent scanner before we hit EUV, has just created something that's a little bit more difficult. And so that's why I have the confidence that this is not something we're shipping, that transistors work. We know the performance is in line. So it's really just about getting the defects and the cost in line to where we want. As far as what does that imply for future technologies, we made a lot of changes at 7 nanometers. 7 nanometers currently is the first technology forecasted to implement EUV. So that immediately makes the lithography system different. We're going back to a more standard for us compaction number of 2.4 So that makes it a little bit easy. We think we've bit off a little too much in this case. And it may not seem like a lot, but 10% can make a lot of difference in this kind of the world. And thirdly, we are using some very unique packaging technologies and such that allow us that 7 nanometers and beyond, we really move into a world where you're not going to look at any piece of silicon as being a single node. You're going to use what we're going to call heterogeneous techniques that allow us to use silicon for multiple nodes. So you may use course from 7 nanometers and IP from 14 nanometers and even as far back as 22 nanometers for the parts that don't need the high performance. And we're able to put those together and make them perform and behave like a single piece of silicon in the package. So really, 7 nanometers is quite a bit different, and so I think as a result, we don't expect to see these kinds of impacts on 7 nanometers. No, it's -- maybe all 3. First, we do expect the adjacencies throughout the course of the year to continue to grow faster than the rest of the business, if you will. So that will have a compression kind of effect throughout the course of the year. Secondly, yes, 10-nanometer will be a headwind. And third, for data center growth, while we're kind of expecting strong growth through the first half of the year, the second half of the year implied in our guidance is a deceleration. And if you put it in the context of kind of the updated guide, we have data-centric growth going from mid-teens to higher teens. And you can attribute virtually all of that to DCG because obviously it's the biggest component. But we do expect there to be deceleration for DCG growth from first half to second half for sure. We hope we're wrong, but where we sit right now, we see the trends continuing to Q2. But we'll have tougher comps. We'll have tougher competition going into the second half, and we're going to wait to July to see kind of how we see the trends we've experienced through the first 4 months of the year play out for the second half. Yes, the -- just the CapEx that we took up, $0.5 billion is really a function of the incremental $2.5 billion of revenue. So of course, when we came into the year, we guided a logic CapEx of roughly $10.5 billion, and we had full year revenue of $65 billion. So we've taken $65 billion up to 67 50. That's going to require roughly $0.5 billion additional CapEx for the second half of the year and as we go into 2019. So it's the best I've ever felt about a CapEx increase, and it's a result of $2.5 billion more revenue and that the CapEx increase, as we indicated, will generate an additional $1.5 billion of free cash flow as well. First, no real changes. As Brian mentioned, it's our first $1 billion order in Q1. We feel good about the demand that we're seeing. Demand -- gigabyte demand is relatively strong. Our cost per gigabyte coming out of our Dalian fab continues to trend down. And at the same time, we see ASPs were down a bit. But as we go through the rest of the year, we see demand and supply to be relatively well balanced. We are ramping [mod a] in Dalian. So that is in the early stages of the ramp that's costing a little bit. Continued gigabyte demand, continuing to scale the Dalian fab and continuing to come down the gigabyte -- the cost per gigabyte curve are all contributing to what we believe will be a continued growth and profitability for the business for the full year. And maybe the only thing I'd add to that is as Bob mentioned in his remarks, our 64 Tier product, we -- I still believe gives us really a leading-edge product and also a very good cost relative to the market. So as we ramp that technology in Dalian at 64 Tiers, we believe our costs are very competitive relative to the rest of the market. Yes, it's a great question, John. What I would tell you is clearly, as we look out into Q2, we're expecting the same kind of positive trend on enterprise for the second quarter. I think as we look at the long term though, that trend that enterprise should decline in that low single digit and it drives and helps fuel the growth of cloud, not all of those are drivers of the growth of cloud, that -- those workloads are moving over to the cloud base continues. I think you're right. Products like Microsoft Azure and others where you can be a hybrid, Azure on-prem versus Azure on cloud, are great examples how, I think, that low single digits is sustainable over the long haul. But I just don't see that trend. Again, I try and look at these businesses not over the quarter or even 1 to 2 quarters, but really thinking about how am I going to invest over the next 2 to 5 years. I got to look at that and say that trend's probably likely to continue. Now for us, you also need to understand that those other segments, so data center, the cloud and like networking and comms, as I look at the Data Center Group are now well over 50% of the revenue of that segment. So we are less and less impacted, I'd say, by the enterprise. If you go back when I started as CEO, enterprise was 60%, 70% of the business. And so we swung wildly by that. It's kind of the other way around now where the cloud and networking and storage are now that 60% to 70% growing to their right and the enterprise is less and less. So the other thing you need to realize, John, is we're more driven by what that cloud is doing anyway. Yes, great question. First, 606, what we expect for the full year, we had a strong benefit in the first quarter and roughly half of that unwinds during the course of the year. So it contribute to growth in Q1. It will unwind itself throughout the course of the year. So full year impact will be likely -- at this stage of the game, we get more around $200 million to $250 million, but it unwinds through the next several quarters. I think your second question, John, was Wind River. Our assumptions are that we will complete the sale of that business at the end of the second quarter. So it's in our second quarter guide, but it's a component of the first half to second half deceleration. The third question, I think it relates to in the first quarter we had good volume, operating margin flow-through to EPS. In the second quarter, the flow-through is not as rich. And the fundamental reason is we have some below-the-line charges associated with, a, the 2039 convertible securities that we have outstanding that have a exchange feature associated with them. And as people, as we hit a certain stock price, our holders can exercise that exchange feature. The implications are there's a noncash charge associated with that, which goes through our interest and other line that's negative. The good aspects of it is all else equal, it reduces our outstanding, our diluted shares and we avoid a coupon going forward. But that will have -- as more people exercise that exchange feature, we'll see that noncash charge below the line. So that's causing a little bit of a drag on the operating income growth flowing through to the EPS in Q2. Okay. So let me try and answer your question. So no, there's nothing wrong with the design libraries or anything like that. I mean, the proof of that is that we're shipping products. So if there were basic functionality issues like that, you wouldn't be able to produce and ship a product. Again, as I said, this is all around how many layers are on multi-patterning and kind of the end-of-life of the emergent for the critical later. The second part of your question was would it benefit to just skip to 7 nanometers and would that have an effect on the capital or the gross margin. The simple answer is no, I don't think that's a good idea. The best answer is to fix -- there's a lot of learning that will happen that we can carry forward in the 7 nanometers, just like we carried from 14 to 10. The other thing is that we still hold roughly 80% of our capital equipment is fungible to the next node or backwards to the prior node. And so that's why as we shifted 10 and 14, we're able to do that without shifting our capital expenditures greatly. We're able to just move the capacity back and forth. The same thing is going to happen between 10 and 7. So you'll have some percentage, and it's always based on demand and how fast things are ramping and all of that. But the equipment will be fungible for the most part between 10 and 7 as well. But no, the right thing to do is exactly what we're doing. This is a unique opportunity we have. There's a lot, lot more performance in 14. We can keep driving that. We'll fix the yield issues. If 10, it's going to have a 10, a 10-plus, a 10++, you can see a lot of products and a lot of performance out of that technology. Brian, I wanted to ask you about China. Your filings indicate that Mainland China was about 20-plus percent of revenue in 2017, and I have 2 questions. One, does that figure represent your exposure to the domestic vendors in China? And I guess just in light of the current environment between the U.S. and China, there's reports now of potential ban beyond ZTE. How concerned are you as it relates to the impact to Intel? So yes, that number is much broader. So that would be -- if you think about it, so everything from shipments in companies like ZTE or Huawei that are more domestically oriented, although Huawei ships around the world now, it goes to Lenovo and companies like that, spread charm, all of those companies now, if you look at Chinese companies, very few are holdings within just China. They're almost all shipping products and selling across the world. So that's -- that number is really representative of all of the companies that are building within China. Our view is that China is an important market as you just described, right, 20-something-plus percent. It's one of our fastest-growing segments as well. It's important to us, and we're counting on our leaders and the leaders of the world to go resolve these issues. We believe in fair trade. We believe that countries and companies need to be able to play in markets fairly and compete, and we're counting on this getting worked out. That's very important to us. Okay. Great. And then Bob, I'm curious if you'll shed more light on longer-term spending targets. But as we build our models for '19, do you think it's reasonable to assume that you can drive additional operating leverage beyond 2018? You're right. I will shed more light on that later. No, but I think, look, the trends that you've seen over the last couple of years is in -- it's kind of how we frame things back at our Analyst Day early last year, I guess. And that is that we're going to see an expanded TAM and with that expanded TAM, accelerating growth in areas that have lower gross margins. And that we expect over time that there will be a modest degradation in gross margins as a result of growing earnings in different segments. But at the same time, we've said that, that gross margin modest erosion, we believe, will be offset by continued -- both continuing to invest in the critical priorities, but getting leverage on our existing spending base. So with that, I think you're going to have a natural offset, and we're 2 years ahead of our targets to get to 30%. We're excited about the accelerating growth of the company, and we do believe that as we continue to accelerate growth and invest in key priorities that our leverage on spending continue to come down. Thanks, Romit, and thank you all for joining us. Operator, please go ahead and wrap up the call.","Brian, one for you about the sustainability of this demand, specifically in the data center side. I think people are pretty aware that the macroeconomic drivers are all kind of going the right way and that's helping the enterprise side of things. But the acceleration of the cloud and the comm side for the last 2 quarters is beating your own expectations for growth rates and been quite strong. How much of that do believe is Intel specific? And if you can go to the reasons why? Or is the macro side really the bigger driver in those 2 vectors as well? That's very helpful. For my follow-up question, one for either of you, frankly. In the 10-nanometer pushout, do you believe that the competitive lead you have versus your competition is shrinking? Or is this a challenge everybody's going to have? And then the gross margin side of that equation, Bob, you said it was going to be a headwind into the full year guide. Any sort of linearity about when that starts to move from being a headwind to a tailwind would be great. I wanted to follow-up on that 10-nanometer point. So as the volume production pushes out into 2019, given you understand the yield issue supposedly, is this a first half kind of push out? Or does it push out into the second half? And when it actually does ramp, do you think it actually will be the current 10-nanometer process that's shipping? Or will that be like slipping out to like 10, 10 nanometers plus potentially? For my follow up, I wanted to ask about gross margin drivers and free cash flow drivers into 2019. We have CapEx pretty significantly outpacing depreciation at the moment. You'll have that 10-nanometer ramp kind of starting. Memory and modems probably going to be growing. And then on the free cash flow side, we've got the reversal potentially of the NAND prepayments eventually as you start shipping the NAND that you've been paid for. So how do we think about the drivers, gross margin puts and takes around those elements and maybe others as we get into -- as we go through -- get into 2019? I guess another question on the manufacturing. Can you just talk about why the ramp in 10-nanometer, why the yields have been a little bit slower than expected? Have there been any changes in manufacturing? And then also, should we expect this to extend to future generations as well, i.e., a little bit slower than it had been in the past? Great. For my follow up, I know in the presentation you mentioned that adjacency ramps will be responsible for some of the gross margins being down in Q2. Does that have any impact on gross margin for the rest of the year? Or are you assuming that data center growth is going to slow down in the second half of the year and that's another reason why the gross margin hasn't moved up? Or is it entirely the 10-nanometer issue? Just first question is on CapEx that's been coming up a bit. If you could talk a little bit about the incremental growth in CapEx, what that's associated with. And are there any CapEx effects associated with the changes in the ramp up of 10-nanometer? All right. Great. And as a follow up, perhaps you can give a bit more color on the expectations on memory as you go through the year. I know you talked about that being profitable and I think consistent with what you said -- what you guys said last quarter. Has there been any changes in your outlook for the year? And if you could talk a little bit about what's framed your expectations as you look through the year for memory. Brian, I think within DCG, the cloud hyperscale dynamics are kind of well understood by investors. 90 days ago, I think what surprised everybody, probably including yourselves, was just the strength of enterprise in the December quarter. And I think when you reported December, you were reluctant to call that a trend and you wanted to get some more data points. I'm kind of curious as to kind of what the view of enterprise is now 90 days later. And specifically, a couple of your key software partners last year in Microsoft and VMware finally brought out kind of their hybrid cloud software stack solution, and I'm wondering if that's actually been the driver of some of this pent-up demand in the enterprise. And how sustainable do you think it is? That's helpful. And as my follow up to Bob, just kind of a multipart question on the guide for Q2 and the full year. First, was the 606 impact embedded in the original March quarter guidance? Is that the only quarter where you'll have a 606 impact? Second, is Wind River now out of the Q2 and full year guide, or is that still in it? And kind of how big is that business? And then third, when you look at Q2 specifically, it just looks like the operating income beat seems a lot larger than the EPS beat. Is there anything going on below the line other than the tax rates that you guided to that can explain that? I actually have a 2-part question on 10-nano. The issues seem to be going on now for some time, and it's almost as if the design libraries or something are flawed. And so I guess the first question is why not skip 10-nanometer and go directly to 7? You guys have a lot of EUV experience and it's going to cut out a lot of the multi-patterning layers. So that's the first question. And number two, the real question is that if you did that, would that be a net drag to gross margin looking out because you never really monetized 10-nanometer?

INTC,Q4 2017,3781,3540,981,"Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO earnings presentation, which replaces the CFO commentary that we've previously used. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The CFO earnings presentation is also available via the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussions contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that, this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Brian. Thanks, Mark. 2017 was a record year for Intel, and fourth quarter results were outstanding, well ahead of the forecast we outlined in October, based on the strength of both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. I'll review our results with you in just a moment, but before I do that, I'd like to share a few words about security. We've been working around the clock with our customers and partners to address the security vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. While we've made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do. We've committed to being transparent, keeping our customers and owners appraised (sic) [apprised] of our progress and, through our actions, building trust. Security is a top priority for Intel, foundational to our products, and it's critical to the success of our data-centric strategy. Our near-term focus is on delivering high-quality mitigations to protect our customers' infrastructure on these exploits. We're working to incorporate silicon-based changes to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware, and those products will begin appearing later this year. However, these circumstances are highly dynamic, and we updated our risk factors to reflect both the evolving nature of these specific threats and mitigations as well as the security challenge more broadly. Security has always been a priority for us, and these events reinforce our continuous mission to develop the world's most secure products. This will be an ongoing journey, but we are committed to that task, and I'm confident we are up to the challenge. To keep you informed, we've created a dedicated website and we're approaching this work with customer-first urgency. I've assigned some of the very best minds at Intel to work through this, and we're making progress. With that, let's turn to our 2017 and fourth quarter results. We just wrapped up the best year in Intel's history with the best quarter in Intel's history. Revenue was up 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, 8% if you exclude McAfee, setting an all-time record. Our data center, IoT and FPGA businesses each set revenue records. We met or exceeded all of the financial commitments we made to you at the beginning of the year, and our focus on efficiency and profitable growth produced significant leverage, driving non-GAAP operating income up 21%. Our data-centric businesses delivered the technology foundations for the new data economy, making the analysis, storage and transfer of data possible, giving our customers the ability to turn data into amazing experiences and actionable insights. They're essential to our strategy. Data-centric revenue, excluding McAfee, was up an impressive 21% over the fourth quarter of last year, and I'd like to share a few highlights with you starting with DCG. DCG's revenue was up 20% over the fourth quarter. The cloud segment was up 35%, comm service providers were up 16%, enterprise was up 11%, and our adjacency revenue was up 35%. We saw broad-based demand strength with customer preference for high-performance products driving richer ASP mix. Cloud segment results were driven by significant volume growth and continued customer preference for higher-performance products. In the comms service provider segment, we continued to take share and grow revenue as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks. Enterprise segment strength was driven mostly by ASP as customers transitioned to Xeon Scalable products in a seasonally strong fourth quarter IT buying window. While we continue to see enterprise customers offload workloads to the public cloud, we are also seeing those customers prioritize performance solutions for hybrid and on-premise buildouts. Customers across all of our segments are accelerating deployment on Xeon Scalable processors, which is ramping roughly in line with our historical Xeon transition. We continue to demonstrate leadership and progress in artificial intelligence with the data center, the edge and some hundreds of watts to milliwatts. Our software optimizations for the Caffe framework has improved already strong, beyond scalable ResNet-50 inference performance by 2x just since the launch in July. The first-generation Nervana neural network processor ran a neural network less than 2 weeks after we received silicon, and we've shipped our first customer units. At the edge, Google announced its AIY Vision Kit featuring our Movidius vision processing unit, and Amazon announced DeepLens, the world's first deep learning-enabled video camera for developers, which uses an Intel CPU, graphics and compute libraries for deep neural networks. We're also seeing design wins that combine technologies from multiple data-centric business units, reinforcing the idea that we have developed a unique and differentiated collection of capabilities that can address customer challenges together more effectively than any one business could alone. A great example is Dahua's recent announcement of their Deep Sense product line, which combines Core CPU, Intel FPGA-based network video recorders, along with Movidius VPU-based cameras, to enable people and automobile detection and smart city application using artificial intelligence. In the Programmable Solutions Group, we saw strong double-digit growth in the data center, auto, embedded and advanced products categories as well as last-time buys of legacy products. That strength was partially offset by softness in comms infrastructure. In Q4, we launched the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL that dramatically increased productivity for our customers. We also delivered first-to-market leadership innovations in the Stratix 10 product line, including the first SoC FPGA with an ARM processor at more than 1 million logic elements and the industry's first FPGA with integrated HBM2 memory. Our Internet of Things Group grew 21% with continuing momentum in retail, video and in-vehicle infotainment verticals. Wind River saw strong multiyear contractor growth and delivered its profitable quarter ever for Intel. The memory business grew 9% and achieved profitability in Q4 as strong client volume was partially offset by a 1-quarter qualification delay of a data center's SSD volumes. Last quarter, I shared with you that our leadership technology is resulting in strong customer interest in long-term supply arrangements. That interest has continued to grow. We have since signed additional agreements and now expect prepayments totaling roughly $2 billion over the course of 2018. Mobileye had another strong quarter, and business momentum is growing. Our 30 design wins over the course of 2017 and 15 new program launches in 2018 are both increases of 2.5x over the prior period. We now have Level 2-plus and Level 3 design wins with 11 automakers who collectively represent more than 50% of global vehicle production. These advanced programs launch over the next 2 years, and they represent a major leap in functionality versus current semiautonomous system and are a significant step towards a scalable Level 4 and Level 5 fully autonomous system. We reached an important milestone in the fourth quarter: the announcement of our Level 3 through 5 autonomous driving platform based on EyeQ5 and Atom, which we'll sample over the next few months. We believe this will be the most advanced, scalable and efficient platform of its kind. EyeQ5 will deliver 24 tera ops of deep learning performance in a 10-watt power envelope, or about 2.5x the efficiency of the competition. Just a couple of weeks ago at CES, we announced that, by the end of 2018, we expect 2 million EyeQ-equipped cars will be collecting crowdsourced data for REM, our Road Experience Management mapping solution. The resulting map will first be utilized in Level 3 beginning in 2019. The ability to crowdsource data to build and rapidly update the precision maps required for higher levels of automation is a major differentiator in our plan to build out the safest and most affordable autonomous vehicle system. It's also a great example of our data-centric strategy at work. And finally, I'd like to touch on our PC-centric businesses, the Client Computing Group. Over the course of the year, the PC market improved. Our 14-nanometer manufacturing costs came down and the competitive environment intensified. Against that backdrop, PCG's focus on innovation and performance, especially in growth segments like gaming, 2-in-1s, thin and light notebooks and enterprise, led to a record Core mix and record i7 volume in the fourth quarter. We also shipped our first low-volume 10-nanometer SKU, and our modem business grew 26% over the fourth quarter of last year. Intel is undergoing one of the most significant transformations in corporate history from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. We have made thoughtful, disciplined investments along the way that have expanded our TAM to $260 billion. Those same investments have produced a collection of data-centric businesses that are unmatched, growing at double-digit rates and approaching 50% of the company's revenue. Our opportunity is larger than it's ever been, and we're hungry to compete and win. In 2018, our highest priorities will be executing to our strategy and meeting the commitments we make to our owners and our customers. This includes our commitment to restoring customer confidence in the security of their data. This year, Intel will celebrate 0.5 centuries of innovation that has profoundly changed the world. Over the last 50 years, we invented the architecture and manufacturing technologies that have made personal computing, the Internet and the cloud not only possible, but pervasive. The journey hasn't been without challenges. Nothing worth doing ever is. Our culture has been forged through taking challenges head-on and developing solutions our customers can count on. That includes working directly to address the Spectre and Meltdown security threats. We leave 2017 on a financial high note, but I'm even more excited about what's to come, about our strategy producing great products for our customers and great returns for our owners. I see Intel innovation changing the world for another 50 years, and that journey starts with 2018. Over the coming year, we'll bring amazing innovation and performance to the PC market, advance the state of art in the artificial intelligence, lead the way towards mass 5G deployment, launch the industry's first new memory architecture in 2 decades and take another step toward a safer world in which autonomous driving is a reality. Looking back on 2017, I could not be more proud of our team and all they have accomplished. As I look to our 50th year, I'm more optimistic and confident than I've ever been about Intel's future. And with that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was an outstanding close to a record 2017, and we are building real momentum heading into 2018. Revenue for the quarter was $17.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year; operating income was $5.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year; and EPS of $1.08 cents was up 37% year-over-year. From a capital allocation perspective, we redeemed $1.6 billion of 2035 convertible debt, reducing our share count by 59 million shares, and repurchased $500 million of higher-coupon debt and exchanged $1.8 billion into 30-year debt at a 1% lower coupon rate. On tax reform, our Q4 GAAP earnings reflect a onetime tax impact of $5.4 billion, and our guidance reflects approximately 7-point improvement in our effective tax rate going forward. To summarize, we had a fantastic quarter and year and are on track to exceed the 3-year targets we laid out at our Analyst Day, 1 full year ahead of schedule. Our Q4 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation from a PC-centric to a data-centric company. Intel's data-centric businesses, those outside of the PC segment, are at an all-time-high mix of 47% of our revenue, up from approximately 40% in 2012. We have made significant investments to expand our TAM into new data-rich markets like memory, programmable solutions and autonomous driving. These investments are just starting to pay off and will fuel Intel's growth going forward. Our PC-centric business was down 2% in a declining PC market, and it continues to be a great source of profitability. DCG delivered its most profitable year since 2011 by focusing on premium and growth segments with industry-leading products. This business generated the cash to fund Intel's investments in new data center growth. Moving to Q4 earnings. We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, up 37% year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth, a 5-point improvement in operating margins and significant gains from our ICAP Portfolio. Our gross margins expanded 2 points in the quarter, and our spending as a percent of revenue declined by 3 points as we delivered $700 million more revenue and $300 million less spending. In terms of operating efficiency, we're well ahead of schedule of meeting our commitment by reducing spending to 30% by 2020. We now expect to achieve this goal no later than 2019. Total spending was down 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while we continued investing in our key priorities including driving Moore's Law forward, winning in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. R&D spending as a percent of revenue was down approximately 1 point, and our SG&A costs were down over 2 points as we rationalized our marketing and sales programs and generated significant leverage in our SG&A functions. Let me touch briefly on our segment performance. Client Computing Group had another strong quarter. Revenue of $9 billion was down 2 points and operating margins were down 2 points. Operating margins were lower on 10-nanometer transition costs. We saw strength in the commercial gaming business, and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at healthy levels. The Data Center Group had record revenue of $5.6 billion, up 20% year-over-year, and operating income of $3 billion grew 59%. Q4 operating margin was 54%. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in execution across all segments. Overall unit volume was up 10%, ASPs were up 8%, and our adjacencies grew by 35%. Our ASP strength demonstrates the value customers see in our high-performance products. Xeon Scalable launched in July, is ramping well, with customers broadly deploying its leadership product family. Revenue scale from leadership products, ASP strength and the exclusion of 2016 onetime charges drove strong operating income growth for the business. For the full year, revenue was up 11% and operating margin came in at 44%, both ahead of the expectations we provided at the beginning of the year. The IoT, NSG and PSG business segments are becoming a larger component of our overall business, collectively growing 19% year-over-year. Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $879 million, growing 21% year-over-year, driven by strength in industrial and video and continued momentum in our retail business. Operating profit was $260 million, up 43% year-over-year. The Mobileye business also had a record quarter, and we are on track to our deal thesis. As we called out last quarter, results for the Mobileye acquisition are included in our all other segment and reflects the Q4 integration of Intel's autonomous driving group spending into Mobileye. Our memory business had revenue of $889 million, up 9% year-over-year, with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. This segment was profitable for the quarter, and we expect this segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018. Programmable Solutions Group had record revenue of $568 million with 35% growth, driven by strength in data center, automotive and embedded. Operating profit was $156 million, up 95% year-over-year. The Stratix 10 design win pipeline, which represents PSG's largest ever, doubled over the last year due to engagements in 5G, cloud computing and the infrastructure transition to network function virtualization. We laid out our capital allocation priorities early in the year: invest organically, expand acquisitively and return capital to our shareholders and do it wisely. In the year, we delivered on our promise. First, we generated strong free cash flow of $10.3 billion in the year and returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through dividends of $5.1 billion and share repurchases of $3.6 billion. Second, we funded a majority of the Mobileye acquisition from the sale of noncore assets during the year, including McAfee and the sale of ASML shares. And third, we redeemed $1.6 billion in convertible debt, reducing 59 million shares, and we also tendered higher-coupon debt for lower-coupon debt. Let me expand on the ICAP- and treasury-related transactions we executed in the quarter. First, we sold 11.4 million shares of our ASML holding, which generated $2 billion in cash proceeds and a gain of $1.5 billion. Second, we redeemed our 2035 convertible debenture. This redemption created a $2.8 billion cash outflow and a noncash loss of $385 million, which was tax-deductible. Since this debenture was convertible and therefore dilutive, the redemption effectively acted as a buyback that will reduce diluted share count by 59 million shares. And third, we successfully tendered $2.3 billion of high-coupon debt in the quarter. We exchanged $1.9 billion of old debt into $2 billion of 30-year new debt, reducing our coupon rate by 1%. We also redeemed $425 million of old debt for cash. This transaction both lowered our leverage and our interest expense. Adding it all up, 2017 was another record year for Intel. Revenue of $62.8 billion was up 9% year-over-year, driven by 16% growth in our data-centric businesses and 3% growth in PC-centric business. Operating income of $19.6 billion was up 18% on strong execution across the businesses and disciplined spending. Earnings per share of $3.46 was up 28% on excellent operational performance and the benefit of $0.35 from ICAP net gains. With the change to the accounting rules for recognizing price changes on equity investments, we do not expect to see these ICAP gains repeat. Before I turn to guidance, let me provide a little more context on the impact of tax reform on our business. Intel's fourth quarter results reflect a higher GAAP income tax expense of $5.4 billion as a result of U.S. corporate tax reform enacted in December. This includes a onetime required tax adjustment on previously untaxed foreign earnings, payable over 8 years, which was partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred income taxes for the new U.S. statutory tax rate. Looking ahead, we expect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers like Intel that compete in today's global economy. We expect a 2018 tax rate of approximately 14%, driven by a lower U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, lower tax on foreign income, benefits from U.S. exporters and the continuation of the R&D credit. The change in our tax rate drives approximately $0.28 in 2018 EPS. Intel has a rich history of investing in U.S.-led research and development and U.S. manufacturing. Just last year, we committed to the fit-up of our Fab 42 facility, creating thousands of jobs at completion. These tax reforms provide further incentive to continue investments like this. Before we turn to our 2018 outlook, I also want to highlight 2 accounting rule changes: first, new accounting rules for revenue recognition; and second, accounting for equity gains and losses. We do not expect a material impact to revenue from the revenue recognition accounting change. The changes in accounting for equity gains and losses will require the recognition of unrealized price changes each quarter, so equity holdings like our ASML position will see mark-to-market adjustments that will flow through earnings in 2018, which may create greater volatility on a GAAP basis. This change resulted in an impact of $2.7 billion of net unrealized gains at year-end that we booked to equity on January 1, 2018. Now moving to the full year. We are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $65 billion, up 4% year-over-year. We expect operating margin of approximately 30%, with gross margins down 2 to 2.5 points and spending as a percent of revenue to be down 1 to 1.5 points. The decline in gross margin is driven by growth in our adjacent businesses as we play in an expanded TAM and transition cost associated with 10-nanometer, both partially offset by higher gross margins from our 14-nanometer products. We expect EPS of $3.55, up 14%, excluding the ICAP net gains, driven by a strong top line growth and a lower tax rate of approximately 14%, which will increase EPS by approximately $0.28. We expect net capital deployed of $12 billion. This reflects gross CapEx of $14 billion, offset by approximately $2 billion of customer prepayments for memory supply agreements. Increase in CapEx reflects our and our customers' confidence in our memory technology leadership. We expect free cash flow of $13 billion, an increase of approximately 30%, directly contributing to our decision to raise our dividend by a full 10%. As we look to the first quarter of 2018, we are forecasting the midpoint of revenue range at $15 billion, up 5% year-over-year. We expect operating margin of approximately 27%, flat year-over-year, with a 3-point decline in gross margins offset by a 3-point decline in spending. We expect EPS of $0.70, up 11% excluding ICAP net gains, from strong top line growth and a lower effective tax rate. We believe 2018 will be another record year for Intel, and we feel great about where we are entering year 2 of our 3-year transformation. We've met and exceeded our commitments. Our PC-centric team continues to operate very well in a down market, and our data-centric businesses are up double digits collectively as we continue to transform the company to power the cloud and smart connected devices. With that, let me turn it back to Mark. All right. Thank you, Brian and Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","John, thanks. It's Bob. So really 2 things going on. One, the enterprise growth in DCG, as Brian highlighted, was up 11% in the fourth quarter. So extremely strong seasonal growth for enterprise, a little bit more than we expected, frankly. That's number one. Number two, PSG's 35% growth was helped by end-of-life sales during the course of the quarter. And if you adjust for maybe a more normalized enterprise growth and PSG growth, you get to more of a seasonal Q4 to Q1 dynamic, so in line with seasonal if you make those 2 adjustments. Sure, John. So my perspective is, if you take a look at it, right, memory kind of -- I mean, logic on our CapEx just scaled with our increase in revenue and kind of our overall growth rate. So that's fell in line. With memory, we're going to take a look at it really on a year-by-year basis. And I'd tell you that Bob's really doing a good job of helping that business unit look over the capital. And when we have demand and people are willing to pay up front for that demand and reserve the capacity, like we've done this year, we're going to go ahead and put that capacity in place plus what we think the overall market we can do as distributing across the overall market. And that's really independent of that changing relationship with Micron. That's really more about how we're doing development work out in time, really, and that's actually still 2 generations away. That really didn't affect 2018. This was really about what we saw for the overall NAND memory market plus the additional capital and capacity that people wanted to reserve through that process. We'll look at that each year, John, and say, ""Okay, as we look out into '19 at the end of '18, we'll do that same analysis."" I would just -- sorry, I would just follow on to Brian's comments. The way we're looking at memory, and we talked a bit about this on the last call, is increased confidence in our customers and the technologies that we're developing where, those relationships, they will help fund the scaling of the capacity to grow the business. And we're really trying to match net capital employed to be in conjunction with known customer demand. So what that means -- what that meant for 2017 is the net capital was roughly $1.5 billion, and we've held that relatively flat in 2018. So while gross capital is higher, we have more conviction in the customer base to fund $2 billion of the gross capital. So memory, we're really trying to focus on customer adoption of our technology to effectively and efficiently scale the business. And then just the only other point I would make on logic, remember, a year ago in terms of our outlook for growth, we're well ahead of our outlook for growth. We were probably, at the time, implied in our outlook was probably a $62.5 billion kind of number in 2018. Obviously, with our guide now, it's $65 billion. We're $2.5 billion higher. And it's that incremental growth that's placing more demands on logic capacity, both for 14- -- 10-nanometer and, as we think forward, on that 7-nanometer. I wonder if you could talk about OpEx. Obviously, you've been pretty disciplined there bringing that down, but you've also got some other initiatives. You've -- you announced a discrete graphics effort. Maybe if you could talk about -- it seems like that would cost a lot, if I just look at what your competitors are spending. And then, at some point, you're going to spend money on NAND that used to be shared with Micron. So just can you talk about the puts and takes there? And is there something that we should think about that's coming down to sort of offset those potential increases? Sure. I'll start, and I'll let Bob kind of give you the under-the-cover detail of the dollars. But Joe, this -- really, we've already factored all of those things in. So things like the discrete graphics is a ramping spend. The memory is R&D spending out in time, so for '18 has no, really, effect. And then we've driven an overall efficiency in all of our R&D spending to offset that. So increasing in GPU spending, there's some other increases as well around things like autonomous driving and some of the other artificial intelligence and some of the emerging areas. You're right. Over time, we'll increase spending in NAND in R&D, but those are being offset by efficiencies that we're driving into the rest of our product R&D. And we really feel like we're getting to a good point where we can keep the pace of innovation going on our core products while we fund these new initiatives as well and not take a beat from our continued efficiency efforts across the spending as a percent of revenue. Yes, Joe, I'd just add some numbers to Brian's words. We've kind of come down from 36% to 35% to 34% to a second half of 2017 at roughly 31% of revenue. So we've been coming down as we've been doing 2 things: One, the investments that we'd been making are paying off in terms of higher growth; and number two, we're making real trade-offs in where we're investing our money. As we go into -- implied in our guidance, as we go into '18, we're expecting our spending levels to be roughly flat with an annualized 2017 spending level. So we're going to -- and underneath that, continuing to drive efficiencies in sales and marketing as we become more of a B2B or data-centric company and getting real leverage on our G&A functions across the board. So we've made real progress during the course of the last couple of years. Including the second half, we expect to make continued progress while making the critical investments in things like discrete graphics, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and continuing to invest in Moore's Law. Okay, great. And then as you think about that NAND investment, I guess people have asked me what you're -- what the separation from Micron on a long-term path means. Does that mean there's sort of more of a focus on propriety products like 3D XPoint? Or do you remain firmly committed to sort of more -- to a more competitive NAND market? Sure. So I just want to make sure you -- we clarify a little bit, Joe. The separation of development work is, again, out in time. Think of it in the 2020 time frame is when the real independence come, and it's NAND-specific. So we continue to work together on 3D XPoint. So -- and this is really just -- it's not a separation of the companies or something about the relationship. The relationship with Micron continues to be a good one, and I foresee it will continue to be a good one in the future as well. This is about direction of where we're going to take our products. And we've talked about ours are very data center-centric and really tied to performance and aligning to the customer market that we're really looking at. And so the spending in R&D we're talking about right now is purely NAND-specific. 3D XPoint continues to be a joint effort. Yes, so we came into the year and we indicated that we expected margins for the full year to be in the kind of 40% to 45% range. And obviously, we started out low, but we said our expectations were that it would grow throughout to the course of the year. A couple of things in the fourth quarter. Obviously, growth. So real good leverage on our existing investment was a big contributor. Secondly, ASPs were up 8%. So of the 20% growth, ASPs accounted for 8 points of that. And as Brian highlighted, whether it's cloud, comms or enterprise, customers in the quarter were really paying for performance. That performance for us was higher ASPs. Third, our continued progress on unit cost. And then, last, you may remember, last year's fourth quarter, we had some warranty- and IP-related charges in the data center business that I think cost us roughly 4 points a year ago. So last year's were a little bit deflated. But good volume leverage, strong ASPs as customers paid for performance and unit cost improving. Yes, I think I wouldn't get too far away from the 40% to 45%, to be honest with you. I think, as we go into 2018, the good -- we think good cloud momentum, that's been consistent performance over the course of the year, last couple of years. Comms, our performance, we believe, was real strong in a somewhat sluggish market, so real share gains. But the high kind of seasonal enterprise growth and strong ASPs in the quarter, we think, are more seasonal in nature, and we're not anticipating enterprise growth to stay at these levels as we go into '18. Yes, I'd just -- I'd highlight 3 things that are driving the deterioration. But I'd start first with we've always characterized our long-term gross margins to be in the 55% to 65% range. And for the last several years, and included in our guidance this year, we'll be at the upper end of that 60% to 65% range. But for the last couple of years, there's -- we've had maturity of 14-nanometer. And that maturity, both in terms of getting more and more performance and lower and lower unit costs, has been contributors to gross margin. As we go into '18, we see 14-nanometer modest contribution from profitability because we've matured on the cost curve. That's an increasingly competitive environment, and we don't anticipate dramatic ASP improvements over the entire company. In some cases, yes, but for the most part, no. So we'll see some continued improvement in 14-nanometer products during the course of the year. Secondly, we are really accelerating the growth of our adjacent businesses. The investments that we've been making in both the data-centric businesses and our growth in modem, those are contributing to our year-on-year EPS growth. However, those -- both of those product lines or businesses have lower margins. So our success in modem and memory is having a mix impact on our gross margins. The third area is we're going from 10-nanometer start-up, where our costs are coming down, to more the ramp to the 10-nanometer. And that ramp is going to weigh on the margins as we begin to develop production going into the second half of the year where we're way up the curve on where our yields and costs are. So those are kind of the 3 things as we see it, and if I were to characterize, roughly plus 1, roughly minus 2, roughly minus 1, rounding those. Ambrish, on your question about -- specifically around competition, I think, every year we look at it as a competitive environment, and we're out to compete for our customers. And so we factor that in each year appropriately, I think, against the competition. So we've looked at the competitive environment, and we believe Xeon Scalable, great performance that has, our overall product road map, we think we have a highly competitive road map and -- have adjusted for that in our forecast. Yes. First, $13 billion in free cash flow, up roughly 30% year-on-year. First, higher cash earnings. Our guide has EPS up roughly 14%. In that guide, there's -- depreciation has grown in '18 relative to 2017. So that has just higher cash earnings. Secondly, we do expect lower working capital as we go through 2018. Third, we have higher strategic customer supply agreements. And those 3 things are all contributing to the positive. And then obviously, Stacy, the higher gross capital is a bit of an offset. So stronger cash earnings, better working capital, more strategic supply, partially offset by higher CapEx. No, that was a NAND -- I'll start with just the answer to that question first, Stacy, that, that was a 3D NAND SSD. We had some delays in the fourth quarter, and those are being addressed now. So that was that comment. No, I think, on your first question, in the $65 billion, we characterized it as roughly low single-digit decline in our PC-centric businesses. So implied in that is PC maybe declining a little bit more and modem, i.e., adjacency within the CCG segment, partially offsetting that. In the overall guide, we said that the data-centric businesses would be growing in the mid-teens. And obviously, that's -- we believe that'll be -- the strongest growth segment within the makeup of our data-centric businesses will be in memory. And it will be a function of customer quals that Brian just highlighted, and we expect NSG growth to accelerate throughout the course of 2018, so single-digit decline on PC-centric and mid-teen growth on data-centric businesses. For the most part, the [wins] for NSG that will go through data center will be late in 2018 and won't really have an impact on the overall growth rate of that business. So it's primarily about growth of 3D NAND during the course of the year. First on the CapEx, we indicated gross capital in the year of $14 billion, that we get customer strategic supply agreements of roughly $2 billion. So our net capital is $12 billion, $12 billion in the year. Again, I'd kind of break that into 2 pieces: memory, net capital employed, no change; and logic, CapEx up roughly $1 billion year-on-year. And as we mentioned earlier, that $1 billion is a function of, primarily growth, continuing to grow 14-nanometer; second, scaling up 10-nanometer; and third, investing in next node 7-nanometer during the course of the year. So those 3 things are really driving the $1 billion increase in CapEx for logic. The second part of your question, the -- so for 10-nanometer, as we bring that equipment online, we turn on -- there's some equipment now that's being depreciated. But as we build -- bring more online, as we ramp in the second half of the year, when we turn that equipment on is when we start depreciating it. So we'd expect our depreciation bill in the second half of the year to be growing. That's one of the contributors to -- yes, really to come full circle, that's one of the contributors to the gross margin deterioration during the course of the years as we start to ramp 10-nanometer. For the first one, Brian, I'm curious, are you baking in any effect on sales or cost or pricing from any resolution on the processor security issues? There is one line of thinking that says customers might decelerate their purchase, and then you have others in the industry saying that customers might accelerate their purchase later on. So I'm just curious how you're looking at the financial implications, positive or negative, from this issue near term and longer term. Sure. So we'll try and kind of break it into 2 kind of answers for that, Vivek. From a cost standpoint, we've baked in and we've talked about that we don't expect any material impact of this security exploit on our spending or product costs or any of that. So that's how we baked that in. From a forecast standpoint, we actually made our forecast, and we've checked it, as we go through this -- the first few weeks here of the year, against our prior forecasts to make sure that the forecast incorporated any changes or any signs we're seeing up or down. And I'll tell you, at the highest level, we're not seeing much of a change in those forecasts as a result of this. So I'd tell you, it's pretty balanced right now. So spending, not material and didn't make any adds there. And then our forecast, we had a forecast. We've checked it as we go through the first few weeks of the year, and it hasn't really changed or altered as we looked at it. And the only other thing I'd add, per Brian's comment earlier, we kind of go into the year realizing that it's an increasingly competitive environment. And our focus is on, right now, continuing to bring the best, highest-performance products to market, but also to -- lots of time and energy spent on focusing on fixing this issue, primarily through software patches as opposed to short-term hardware things. Got it. And as my follow-up, for the full year, how should we think about growth in just the DCG business? I understand you gave some color around the entire data-centric group, which includes memory and other segments. But just sort of apples-to-apples, how should we think about growth in just DCG, which had a very strong double-digit growth year in '17? Yes. Throughout the course of the year, we -- sorry, throughout the course of '17, we kind of guided to high single digits, and we kind of executed to that throughout. And then Q4 wasn't dramatically different than the first 3 quarters of the year, really, with the exception of the high seasonal spend for enterprise. And that really took us from a high single-digit to low double-digit or 11% growth for the year. As we go into '18, we do not expect that -- we think that, in the enterprise space, things will go back down to the negative single-digit range and, therefore, don't anticipate a dramatic difference in how we laid out DCG a year ago. So that's how we're thinking about it. If I maybe elevate that back up a little bit and just think about when we're putting together our plans for the year, there's 2 areas where our tendency is to be a little cautious on the outlook. One is PC TAM. We tend to be a little more cautious on PC TAM, and we tend to be a little more cautious as we think about enterprise growth in the DCG business. And the reason we do that is we think it's important to be cautious, get our costs in line. And if our assumptions on market rate to growth turn out to be conservative, we'll benefit from -- we believe we'd benefit from higher volume and real strong flow-through to net income. That's how we planned the year coming into 2017, and we did kind of the same thing for 2018. So I don't anticipate dramatically different DCG growth in how we laid out 2017 as we enter 2018, because we really haven't assumed a change in trajectory of enterprise CIO spending in the course of the year. I just wanted to go back to the DCG ASPs. You had talked about the ramp of Scalable being kind of to plan, but then I think you got a nice tailwind. I think you implied enterprise had a higher percent of Scalable. So I just wondered if you could just talk on broad strokes just where the Scalable ramp is here, and how your expectation kind of getting through the year, where that could go. Sure. So I'll start, and Bob can add some number detail and all. The Xeon Scalable ramp is right in line with prior ramp of similar products on our DCG road map. And what you saw when we talked about Q4 was not necessarily more Xeon Scalable but people buying up the stock on Xeon Scalable, which drove ASP. So they're buying the higher-performance, higher-priced parts. And that's not uncommon when, at the early stages of a ramp, people come in and they typically want to buy the highest-performing parts at the beginning, and then they fill out their distribution as other buyers come in and other parts of the market kind of open up. So ramp's on schedule and aligned with prior ramps, and the ASP was more about buying up on the higher-performance parts than necessarily a volume statement. Got you. And then I also want to go back on just -- sorry. I just want to go back on gross margin as well. As you look for March, you mentioned the drop is from adjacent business as well as 10-nanometer. Obviously, memory, you're signaling a big ramp, but it doesn't resolve fully. I'm just wondering if, Bob, you could just walk through the 10-nanometer start-up costs as they kind of move through the year, and kind of if you can outline, between those 2 in Q1, what's the bigger factor. So I see mix dynamics are going to be a bigger factor overall for the year, both in Q1 and for the rest of the year, as our memory and modem business continue to accelerate strong growth. So that's going to be the biggest impact. I think 10-nanometer will have an impact just right out of the gate and will kind of continue throughout the year as we scale volume, but also need to improve yields during the course of the year. So hopefully, that's helpful. All right. Thank you all for joining us today. Operator, please go ahead and wrap up the call.","Yes, my first question just revolves around the revenue guidance for the March quarter. At the midpoint, down about 12% sequentially is a lot worse than, I guess, normal seasonal. And I guess I'm trying to figure out kind of the parameters that you guys are using to come up with that number. Was there something in the DCG strength in the calendar fourth quarter that you don't think is repeatable? Given your comments around the PC supply chain being healthy, that to me feels a little bit more seasonal than not in the March quarter. So I'm just kind of curious as to why Q1 revenue would be so much below what has been kind of the 5-year median seasonality for Q1. That's very helpful. And then, Brian, on my second question revolves around CapEx. I think it was a year ago on this conference call that you kind of mentioned that you thought that calendar year '17 and calendar year '18 would be sort of above trend-line CapEx spending for you guys, and then you thought it would come down again in calendar year '19 to a more normal trend, albeit you didn't quantify the trend. Just given the big uptick in '18 to $14 billion, I realize $2 billion of that's already being covered by prepayments, but how do we think about kind of the trend-line CapEx from here, especially in light of the changing relationship between yourself and Micron on IMFT? (inaudible) Brian and Bob, I wanted to go back to DCG, specifically on the op margin front. We have not seen a [5-handle], if my model is correct, it's been 8-plus quarters. So can you please speak to the sustainability of the op margin and kind of what were the drivers that got you to that level? And then I had a follow-up as well, please. So we should expect this level going forward, Bob? Okay, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up on the gross margin for next year, you provided the -- sort of qualitatively the adjacency as well as the cost impact from the XRAM. But, a, I was surprised you didn't mention competition because now AMD will have a full year of product in an area they never were for -- I shouldn't say never -- they were not in an area for a long time. So question is are you seeing any competition? Are you factoring that in? And then, b, would it be possible to quantify the 2 impacts that you mentioned? Firstly, can you walk us through your free cash flow waterfall? I can't get there. Flattish operating income on 4% revenue growth. You lose a couple billion dollars in ICAP gains. CapEx, I guess, maybe it's flattish with the memory prepayments. Taxes maybe gets me 1/3 to half of the way there, but where does the rest of the free cash flow come from? Are you just draining a ton of working capital or what? Can you walk us through? Okay. For my follow-up, I want to ask about the growth next year of your kind of adjacent businesses versus your core businesses. Of that $65 billion of that 4%, can you give us a feeling how much of that is coming from the adjacent, I guess mostly memory and modems, versus the core? It must be decent, given the gross margin pressures. And I guess, as a corollary to that, you mentioned a one delay -- 1-quarter delay in data center memory. Is that -- was that a statement on XPoint? Okay. And growth -- I'm sorry, go ahead. So what does that memory strength imply for the data center growth, the DCG growth, particularly given the strong performance in Q4? I guess a couple of housekeeping questions, if I could kind of put them together. Curious if you could share with us how you're thinking about CapEx spend between logic and memory. And then, on the 10-nanometer start-up, can you share with us when you're expecting to begin depreciating those costs?

INTC,Q2 2018,2852,2758,1486,"Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window, for those joining us online. I'm joined today by Bob Swan, our Interim CEO and Chief Financial Officer; Murthy Renduchintala, Group President of the Technology, Systems Architecture & Client Group, and Chief Engineering Officer; as well as Navin Shenoy, Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Data Center Group. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from Bob, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Mark. Our results for the quarter were outstanding, marking a record second quarter on our way to what we expect will be a record 2018. Last week, we celebrated Intel's 50th year as a company, which is a big deal in an industry that never stops evolving. Even more remarkable is that after 5 decades in tech, Intel is poised to deliver its third year in a row of record financial performance. We set a course 5 years ago to transform the company. To do that, we made investments to enhance and extend our core microprocessor business along with a series of bold bets to compete and win in new markets. Our thesis was that Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the world's insatiable need to process, store and move data. The results have been dramatic. We are now competing for a $260 billion TAM, the largest in the company's history, and we have lots of room to grow. Just 5 years ago, roughly 1/3 of our revenue was data-centric. Today, nearly 1/2 of our revenue is data-centric and growing at a double-digit rate. Data has never been more pervasive nor more valuable. In fact, 90% of the digital data ever created was generated in just the past 2 years. But of that data, only 1% has been analyzed, indicating massive untapped potential. I'd like to highlight a few indicators of Intel's accelerating transformation before going into our financial results. First, in our data center business, our focus on the cloud, network transformation and AI and analytics produced outstanding results in a strong demand environment. Customer preference for our highest performance products continued, with Xeon Scalable at nearly 50% of our mix in the second quarter. Cloud revenue grew as service provider CapEx continue to accelerate to meet the explosive demand for digital services, artificial intelligence and data analytics. Enterprise revenue is driven by a combination of macro strength and companies' increasing deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data-intensive workloads. In the comms service providers segment, we continue to gain share as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel Architecture. Our Programmable Solutions Group also delivered strong results this quarter. PSG again set a record for design win volumes, indicating customers' confidence in our road map and growing adoption of FPGAs for workload acceleration from the data center through the network and out to the edge. Earlier this month, we announced the planned acquisition of eASIC, which will give us a competitive differentiator and another solution to meet customers' diverse time-to-market performance, cost and power needs. We combined Intel and Altera 2.5 years ago and we expected a key value driver to be the increasing use of FPGAs in the data center. In Q2, PSG's data center business more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter. IoTG set an all-time revenue record with particular strength in the retail and industrial sectors as customers look to Intel not only for compute performance, but for solutions that drive business value. We also completed the sale of Wind River as we continue to redeploy resources to higher growth and return areas. Building on this industry leadership in ADAS and driving the industry toward an autonomous future, Mobileye set another all-time revenue record. Customer momentum continued with several design wins, including a multimillion unit deal with ZF for a large global automaker. We also announced that Baidu has adopted Mobileye's EyeQ base surround computer vision kit as the preferred vision solution for commercial Apollo pilot AV deployment. In both the open source and commercial Apollo programs, Baidu will also integrate Mobileye's responsibility sensitive safety model, an open and transparent model that provides safety assurance for AV decision-making, an industry imperative. Our memory business also set an all-time revenue record. We are transforming the memory industry with a pair of differentiated platform-connected capabilities, high-density Floating Gate 3D NAND and high-performance persistent Optane technology. We've recently announced that we are in production on the industry's first 4 bits per cell data center NAND PCIe SSDs. And at the same time, industry support for Intel Optane DC persistent memory continues to grow with technology leaders, including CERN, Google, SAP and Tencent already announcing plans for future use of the technology. Unlike traditional DRAM, Intel Optane DC persistent memory will offer the unprecedented combination of high capacity, up to 3 terabytes per socket, along with affordability and persistence. Intel and Micron recently announced that we will develop future generations of 3D XPoint technology independently to better align the technology to our individual business needs and strategy. We'll continue to jointly manufacture 3D XPoint at the Intel Micron flash technology fab in Lehi. Intel intends to extend its leadership with Intel Optane products based on 3D XPoint, which, combined with our high-density 3D NAND technology, offer the best solution for today's computing and storage needs. And finally, in client computing, our focus on innovation and differentiation in the commercial, enthusiast and fin and light segments is producing results. Overall market conditions also continue to improve, and we now expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year for the first time since 2011. The commercial segment remains strong as CIOs refreshing aging PC fleets are turning to Intel Core processors with vPro as the gold standard for performance and manageability. At the same time, consumer interest in gaming and our outright performance leadership are driving strength in the enthusiast segment, producing another outstanding quarter in gaming. These trends reflect the market's demand for our highest performance products, resulting in strong overall product mix in CCG. We also began shipping the 7560 modem, Intel's first CDMA and first multi-SIM capable modem. Our industry-leading products continue to deliver outstanding results. We have a leadership 14-nanometer product lineup for 2019 and we continue to make progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving consistent with the time line we shared in April and we expect systems on shelves for the 2019 holiday season. In the second quarter, we announced the CEO change. The board is making good progress determining the best person to be the next CEO of this great company. While there is no timetable, the board is working with a sense of urgency and the identification of candidates, both internal and external, is well underway. Personally, and on behalf of Intel's 100,000-plus employees, I'd like to thank Brian for his many contributions to the company over his 35-year career. The investments he made set us on a course for transformation. Even more importantly, he developed the right strategy and leadership team to carry that transformation forward while we conduct the CEO search. Our financial results in the second quarter show we're doing just that. Let's turn to the numbers. Revenue of $17 billion was up 15% year-over-year, marking a second record quarter. We saw strong performance across all of our businesses and record revenue in NSG, IoTG and Mobileye. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 26%. Excellent operating margin leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in EPS of $1.04, up 44% year-on-year, even as we continue to invest for growth. From a capital allocation perspective, year-to-date we have generated $6.3 billion of free cash flow, returned $8.6 billion to shareholders, including $2.8 billion in dividends and $5.8 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 117 million shares. As a result of the continued strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full year revenue guide by $2 billion to $69.5 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.30 versus April to $4.15, and the free cash flow guide by $0.5 billion to $15 billion. Our leadership products are winning in an expanded TAM and our data-centric businesses are now almost 50% of our total revenue. Our data-centric businesses had strong quarters, with each business individually growing at a double-digit rate. Our PC-centric business was up 6% on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments. Q2 was another quarter of significant EPS growth, up 44% year-on-year. And our operating margin expanded $1.4 billion and 5 points year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the data center and client businesses, leading to higher volumes and ASPs, strong growth in our adjacent businesses and lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks. In January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal for 2018, a full 2 years ahead of schedule. We are on track to meet that target and our operating efficiency continues to improve. We remain extremely diligent in managing spending while prioritizing investments in areas that will accelerate revenue growth, product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. This focused approach is producing results. Total Q2 spending came in at $5.1 billion, 30% of revenue. Total spending as a percentage of revenue is down 4.6 points year-over-year in the quarter while we continue to increase investment in our key priorities. Versus the second quarter of last year, we delivered $2.2 billion more revenue with no incremental spending. Let's talk now about our Q2 performance by segment. The Data Center Group delivered another great double-digit growth quarter with revenue of $5.5 billion, up 27% year-over-year and operating income of $2.7 billion, up 65%. Q2 operating margin was 49%, and we continued to see strong growth in both the cloud and comms service providers segments, which now make up 2/3 of DCG revenue. Platform unit volume was up 14% and ASPs were up 11%. Non-CPU adjacencies grew 30% over last year, yet another indicator that we are growing share in a larger data-centric TAM. We saw continued broad-based demand strength this quarter with customer preference for leadership products like Xeon Scalable driving strong mix. The cloud business, our largest data center segment, grew 41% year-over-year as hyperscale CapEx expands to handle the explosive need to transmit, store and analyze data. Our comms service providers segment grew 30% year-over-year as customers continue to choose Intel Architecture to transform their networks. And our enterprise segment was up 10% year-over-year against a strong IT spending environment and prioritized investment in hybrid cloud implementations. Our other data-centric businesses, IoTG, NSG and PSG, also achieved double-digit growth in Q2. And together, we're up 22% year-on-year. Our Internet of Things business achieved record volume and record revenue of $880 million, up 22% year-over-year, driven by strength in retail and industrial, as I mentioned earlier. Operating profit was $243 million, up 75% year-over-year on higher revenue and flat spending. We expect the Wind River divestiture, which closed in the second quarter, will have a negative impact to IoTG revenue of approximately $150 million in the second half of 2018. Mobileye also had another strong double-digit growth in the quarter, up 37% over last year on increasing ADAS adoption. Our memory business delivered more than $1 billion in revenue for the second quarter in a row, up 23% year-over-year. Optane gained momentum during the quarter, mostly on client strength, shipping over 1 million client Optane memory modules. We expect the memory segment to have full year profitability in 2018 as we scale revenue and transition a higher percentage of our output to a cost-effective 64-layer 3D NAND. PSG's revenue came in at $517 million, up 18% in Q2, primarily from strength in the data center business. PSG's data center segment was up 140% over last year. In the Advanced products category, our 28-, 20- and 14-nanometer solutions grew 70%.  Operating profit was $101 million, up 4% year-over-year. Finally, the Client Computing Group continued to execute on all fronts with another outstanding quarter, generating $8.7 billion of revenue, up 6%. Operating margin percent was flat year-over-year as the customer preference for high-performance products drove a strong mix and higher ASPs, offset by 10-nanometer ramp costs. DCG continues to be an extremely important source of IP, scale and cash flow for our company. We are executing to our capital allocation priorities of investing organically, expanding acquisitively and returning capital to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we generated $13.7 billion in cash from operations, we invested $7.4 billion in capital expenditures and delivered $6.3 billion in free cash flow, up 61% over the first half of last year. We returned well over 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Buybacks totaled $5.8 billion and dividends totaled $2.8 billion. In addition, settlements of our convertible debt reduced fully diluted shares by 12 million. Shifting gears to our full year outlook. Our strategy is working. Our products are winning and our investments in data center growth are paying off. We are now forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $69.5 billion, up $2 billion versus our expectations in April. This represents a $4.5 billion increase versus the expectations we set in January. Product innovation, a strong global economy and U.S. tax reform are spurring CIO investment in IT infrastructure, leading to higher data center demand and a stronger PC TAM. We are seeing demand signals in supply feasibility to deliver on our revised expectations. Our biggest challenge in the second half will be meeting additional demand, and we are working intently with our customers and our factories to be prepared so we are not constraining our customers' growth. Data center growth is now expected to be approximately 20%, up from our April guidance of high teens. We now expect operating margin of approximately 32%, an increase of 1 point from April. We remain on track to our 30% spending goal, a full 2 years ahead of our original target. Gross margin is expected to be up slightly versus our April guidance on broad-based business strength. And we expect a full year tax rate of roughly 12.5%, down slightly from our prior estimate. Overall, we expect stronger top line growth, improved operating margins and stronger demand will boost EPS to $4.15, up $0.30 from our estimate in April. In response to the stronger demand, we are raising gross CapEx $0.5 billion to $15 billion or $13 billion net of memory prepayments. And we are now expecting free cash flow of $15 billion, up $0.5 billion from April. And we expect free cash flow per share as a percentage of EPS to improve by more than 10 points over last year. We remain intensely focused on closing the gap between free cash flow and EPS and expect to make more progress next year. For Q3, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $18.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We expect operating margin of approximately 34%, flat versus last year, which reflects about a 1 point decrease in gross margin and a roughly 1 point decline in spending. We also expect EPS at $1.15, up 31%, excluding equity adjustments from stronger top line growth, spending reductions and a lower tax rate. Again, last week, we celebrated our 50th anniversary and reflected on the impact Intel and our ecosystem partners have had on the world. It has been nothing short of extraordinary. At the same time, we are even more excited about the role Intel will play in technology's future. We're laser-focused on Intel's opportunity, which is larger than it has ever been. Intel's inventiveness, architectural innovation, manufacturing expertise and intense drive have allowed the company to create and capitalize on opportunity over the long haul. From the early days of DRAM to the era of the first microprocessors, from one architectural battle to the next, and from the PC to the Internet to the cloud, Intel has grown and thrived. I'm very excited about what lies ahead for the company. With that, let me turn it over to Mark and we'll get to your questions. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Bob. Moving on to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go and introduce our first questioner.","Bob, on 10-nanometer progress, any color on what you are doing. And systems you mentioned on shelves for second half '19, I assume that's mostly PC Client. Any sense to when we can think of timing for your server products on 10-nanometer also. This is Murthy. I'll take that one. We continue to make progress on 10-nanometers. Yields are improving consistent with the time lines we shared in April. And yes, you're quite right. The systems on shelves that we expect in holiday '19 will be Client systems with Data Center products to follow shortly after. So good progress on 10-nanometer and what we think is a very good lineup on 14-nanometer products for next year on both client and server that we think will deliver best-in-class performance as we continue to ramp 10. So let me take that. I think as we look at what we need to do in 10 nanometers, again, let me replay some of the data we shared on our April call. Recall that 10 nanometers strive for a very aggressive density improvement target beyond 14 nanometers, almost a 2.7x scaling. And really, the challenges that we're facing on 10 nanometers is delivering on all the revolutionary modules that ultimately deliver on that program. And while there's risk and a degree of delay in our time line on that where we're very pleased with the resiliency of our 14-nanometer road map where in the last few years we've delivered in excess of 70% product performance improvement as we move through our 14-nanometer generation of products. So as we look at 2019, across both client and data center space, we feel very good about the product competitiveness of our 14-nanometer program. And that, to some degree, is factoring into our timing of 10-nanometer and launching 10-nanometer at a point in time where we believe the yields are at a level that make it prime for volume production. So 14-nanometer, I think through the rest of this year and through 2019, continues we believe to drive product leadership across all our portfolios in clients and server. Yes, thanks, John, I'll start and then have Navin chime in. Q2 data center growth was outstanding. We kind of started -- when we talked to you back in April, we started the quarter out strong. The middle of the quarter was strong and the end of the quarter was strong. So 27% top line growth for data center was -- we feel very good about it and see that momentum continuing into the second half of the year. As you know, Q4 last year was an outstanding year, so we had slightly tougher comps in the fourth quarter. But we're looking at real strong growth for the full year. And as I indicated earlier, the strength was across the board: cloud, up over 40%; comms services, up 30%. And specifically to your question, enterprise strength continues. And not only volume, but the trajectory of Xeon Scalable and the adoption of Xeon Scalable has accelerated a little bit beyond what we expect to driving real good ASPs. So real good first half, strong outlook for the second half and slightly tougher -- strong outlook in the second half across the board and then slightly tougher comps as we go into Q4. Yes. Thanks, Stacy. First, I think the first half to second half dynamics, we're looking at an operating margin improvement by 1.5 to 2 points. So we see good solid op margin growth first half to second half. The dynamics are the gross margin, we expect to come down a bit and be more than offset by good volume leverage on a relatively stable spending base. So that trend of modest gross margin erosion more than offset by spending leverage driving op income improvement is the trend that you've been seeing for the last 6 to 8 quarters, and we expect that to continue into the second half of the year. When you look at -- implied in our guide for Q4, in particular, couple of things going on. One, accelerating growth of modem as we go through the second half of the year, accelerating growth of NSG or memory as we go through the second half of the year. A, we haven't assumed the continued strong ASP performance that we've seen through the first half. We hope that turns to be conservative, but we'll see how that plays out. And then, lastly, to your point, and Murthy mentioned earlier, we're ramping up 10-nanometer to improve the yield. So that's going to weigh on gross margins for the fourth quarter as well. So all things equal, we feel good about op margin expansion. We're up 500 basis points in the quarter. We'll be up another couple of points first half to second half, but the gross margin dynamics will weigh on us in the fourth quarter and spending will more than offset it. As we go into 2019, I think the way we've been running the business for the last few years, we have dramatically expanded our TAM. And with that TAM, we see more and more opportunities to invest and grow, and that growth is driving improved earnings for the company. At the same time, some of that growth has lower gross margins. But that expanded TAM, the higher revenue growth on a very well-controlled spending base is expanding our op income dollars and our earnings per share. So we feel pretty good about where we are as we exit 2018 and head into 2019 in terms of operating income for the business. The one thing I'd add, Ross, is on the accelerator side, particularly the FPGAs. 18% growth for FPGAs in the quarter, and as we mentioned earlier, real strong penetration in data center. So that growth has been fueled by 140% increase in PSG in the data center environment. So I think, Navin, if I could, had a choice to make when he took over in the data center business and it was protect our large microprocessor share or dramatically expand the market and both protect our share as well as participate in a much bigger market, and that's how he and the team have been focused. And that's resulted in both protection of CPUs, but expansion of share, and a much broader TAM. So again, I'll just close with we feel great about what the team is doing in expanding the role we play in the data center and at the edge. I just want to ask you about 7. You mentioned 10 and timing there and I don't expect you to put a date out there for 7. So maybe you can talk about what you've learned on 10, how you're applying it to 7 and any indications of that development, how it's going. Sure, Blayne. So 7 is very much R&D in deep progress and we're making good progress on that development. We're not giving a direct time line right now. But we've also made some fairly judicious choices in defining 7, learning from our 10-nanometer experiences. And we're focusing on an optimum balance point between density, power and performance and schedule predictability. So I think what you'll see is a more balanced approach across those 3 vectors. So we're still going to drive density, but balancing that with a continued focus on driving transistor performance at the same time, which is highly valued as ASP drivers, both in our client and server businesses. And we're really also focusing on being much more precise in our ability to launch. So those are the key learnings that are coming out of 10 as we go into 7. And as we monitor progress on 7 just as closely as we are on 10, I feel those lessons are being well absorbed into our progress. And we're lining up to support our product plans as our road map dictates. Yes. I presume by segment out, you mean quantify, and my answer's probably unfulfilling if that's the case. But I think you hit on the 3 things. And as we go into the -- as we enter the second half and the fourth quarter in particular, we see modem accelerating. We have a great product that's getting good traction in the modem space, so that product's accelerating and that obviously has margins a little lower. NSG growth accelerating. Going into the fourth quarter, those margins are a little bit lower. 10-nanometer ramping, and that will weigh on gross margins. And lastly, just our outlook for ASPs. ASP has been a significant contributor to our high gross margin performance over the last couple of quarters. Now we've assumed that it won't kind of stay at those levels. So those are the 4 components of segmentation. And then I just go back to with this high growth, we're getting really good leverage and expect our operating margins to improve as we go to the back half of the year. I was wondering, so DCG, you guys have had an 11% ASP increase. And I know there's a lot of noisiness to that, but it's about double what you've sort of averaged over the last few years. Is that a Purley effect? And if so, do you sort of anniversary that and have less of an ASP increase going forward? Just how should I think about the price increase as you've seen there on average? Yes, Joe. The ASP strength that we've seen, actually, really most of it this year is sort of a reflection of what we see our customers doing across the board. All of them are buying our highest performance products. There's sort of this insatiable appetite for performance on all the workloads that they're looking at. Certainly, we did expect the transition to Purley to be accretive to us from an ASP point of view. But if I look at our broad portfolio of products, our ASPs look very good. And year-on-year, our ASPs look good in the other parts of our products as well, Broadwell, for example. So in general, we're just seeing an almost insatiable appetite for the best products, the highest-performing products that we have. I don't see that slowing down as I look forward. Yes, when we started the year, our outlook for the year was $65 billion in revenue. And 6 months through the year, given strong demand across the board, actually, both servers and PCs. Real strong demand has raised our outlook by $4.5 billion for the year. So we feel very good about the demand signals we see at the $69.5 billion level. We feel very good about having the supply in place for that fairly significant demand increase. And now as we go to the back half of the year to the extent demand continues to increase, which I'd say it has almost month-to-month the first 6 months of the year, we need to work with our customers and our fabs to make sure that we continue to have the capacity to fill demand to the extent that it rises beyond the $69.5 billion level. So we're working closely with our customer base, both on the server and the PC side, and very closely with our internal teams to make sure we're not a constraint to the extent that demand in the second half of the year continues to go up like it has through the first 6 months of the year. And our intent is to fill that demand along the way and not give others the opportunity to fill it for us. Yes. So just maybe repeat, 27% top line growth and 65% operating income growth with an 11-point improvement in operating margins year-on-year. So outstanding performance on product margin, as Navin indicated, particularly with strong ASP performance, our margins have continued to improve and I'd just say not at the expense of curtailing investments for data center business. We see real good growth opportunities and we continue to invest. So really good expansion in margin performance while continuing to invest. In terms of 10-nanometer, that is more -- again, with client being first on 10-nanometer, they are more feeling the effect of the 10-nanometer on their margins. That's relatively de minimis effect for the DCG business. In general, we're going to see a much shorter ramp period between our products going forward in client and server. So yes, I think it's a good observation. But as we talk about our client systems on shelf by the second half of '18, you shouldn't expect too much of a delay before you see the data center products coming out. So much closer proximity albeit slightly delayed than we expected on 10, and then you should see that pretty much improve to almost parity of launch as we get into later technologies. So the traditional model of server following rather lengthily after client is probably going to become more sequential going forward. Yes. I think, obviously, from node to node over the last several nodes, frankly, the capital intensity of the business with each node hasn't -- has increased over time. At the same time, the amount of reuse of equipment and tools from one node to the next is extremely high. So with the exception of particularly 10 going to 7 litho-changing quite a bit with EUV, with each node even with more capital intensity, we have relatively high reuse, then we can leverage the tools for longer and longer. So in terms of implications on gross margin, I'd just say it's a function of product leadership and maintaining that product leadership. And Navin talked about how customers are looking for high performance and the ASPs associated with that high performance allows us to continue to generate extremely attractive gross margins, despite increased capital intensity as you go to each node. I just wanted to add to Bob's perspective. The way I look at our road map, what we're really focused on is delivering product leadership generation over generation, and that's at the system level. And while processes are very important part of that recipe, so are the other ingredients as well, such as product architecture, silicon design and packaging. And to Bob's point, as we look towards our road map, gross margin maximization is going to come from delivering excellence that drives performance, and therefore, we're taking a very balanced view on all the ingredients that go into that. So you should expect in our road map going forward a much longer overlap between generations of technology as we try and make sure that, along with process, we add the other ingredients of technology leadership that will become more and more apparent. Just looking at gross margin for the longer term, you named the 4 components. And as we look beyond fourth quarter, does modem gross margins improve? And is 10-nanometer less of a drag in the future? And can you kind of frame it, how long that would be? Yes. I mean, first, we've been -- our gross margin performance has been very strong, in the upper end of our kind of long-term gross margin target. So we feel pretty good about where gross margin sits today. In terms of modem in particular, yes, we do expect to improve gross margins for our modem business, both with our 7560 product that will begin to ship in the second half. But also as we migrate to a 5G world, we expect margins in the modem business to continue to improve. So yes, we expect modem profitability to improve. We don't see it at the 60-plus percent gross margin level, but we do expect it to be a contributor to earnings performance as we go forward. Yes. Again, while we haven't talked about it that much, the custom foundry aspects of our business still remain very particularly important to us. We believe that as we continue to explore growth and partnership opportunities in our data-centric businesses, the ability to develop custom silicon products together with our customers is going to become increasingly important. So as we see our customer relations going forward, you'll probably see a lot more codeveloped products using Intel process technology in order for their delivery and their interworking with the product portfolio that Navin talked about. So custom products through a custom foundry relationship remain a strategically important part of our customer engagement portfolio. All right. Thank you everyone for joining us today. Operator, please go ahead and wrap up the call.","A quick follow up on 10-nanometer. When you -- when I look at this time line between now and (inaudible) season next year, 18 months is a very long time to improve your yield. And I have 2 questions on this one. The first one is, could you give us some color on what are the most challenging aspects of the process that you need to address to improve yields? What's the most challenging dynamic or process? And then my second question is how do you think about the impact of this delay on your competitiveness? Where do you think it is going to hurt you the most? Just relative to your data center expectations now for the full year, I'm just kind of curious what's been the biggest driver. You're kind of decelerating to mid-teens in the back half of the year, which is still very impressive. And I guess, as you talk about the question, maybe Navin can chime in. Once again, enterprise is much better than expected. And the 10% growth, I think, is what you referenced year-over-year in the June quarter. To what extent is that going to be more sustainable as you look into the second half of the year and into 2019? The only thing I'd add to that, John, is that the demand is broad-based across all the segments that Bob talked about. And it's also broad-based in terms of our product portfolio. Xeon Scalable, we launched about a year ago and it crossed over, getting close to crossing over at about 50% of our volumes. So a lot of room still to go on Xeon Scalable as we look forward. And as I think about the product portfolio beyond Xeon Scalable, you might have seen this week at the Google Next show, Google talked about adopting the Optane persistent memory DIMM, so we have that product portfolio ahead of us in the second half. And then our next-generation Xeon will begin to ramp in the early part of '19. So general macroeconomic, all segment growth, people applying information technology to handle their data problems, combined with a very strong product portfolio as we look forward. I guess, one question. I wanted to ask about gross margins. Your full year guide implies a very significant deceleration of gross margins in Q4, like 300 bps sequentially, down about 59%. Can you talk about what's driving that sequential decline from Q3 to Q4? And do those drivers sustain into 2019, for example, is it 10-nanometer or mix or whatever? Can you give us some color on what's going on there, please? I want to go back to the DCG side of things. Obviously, the 27% year-over-year growth in 2Q is very impressive in both its magnitude and its breadth. But I get a ton and an increasing amount of questions about competition, whether it's direct competition in the x86 CPU side of things or if it's a more indirect competition for a greater TAM from accelerators and FPGAs and the GPU compute, those sorts of things. So I don't know if it'd be Murthy or Navin, but I'd love to hear how you guys are looking at competition. And if you've taken the 10-nanometer aspect of competition and 7-nanometer for those folks off the table, talk about the design side where you think you can take share or there might actually be some pressure, and in general, how Intel reacts to the optimism we're hearing from a number of your aspiring new entrants. Sure, I'll take that. It's Navin here. Look, we feel great about our competitive position. We came in to 2018 expecting a competitive environment. And against that backdrop, you've seen the results we've delivered over the last 2 or 3 quarters, and this is our third consecutive quarter above 20% growth. And really, that reflects our investments that we've made over several years. We have a leadership road map, not just in CPUs, but in, as you pointed out, a broad set of additional silicon, from ASICs to FPGAs to silicon photonics to memory. And our approach, really, has been to, over time, increasingly stitch all of those assets together to deliver a better solution for our customers. And that really sets us apart from everyone that we're competing with where one or another may have one of those solutions, but very few have -- in fact, none have that broad portfolio that we've been pursuing. So we are going to be aggressive in competing. We're going to have to go out and earn the business, just like we always have every day, every week, every month. And as I look at our road map now and as I look at our road map in the second half and as I look at our road map into 2019, I'm very confident that we continue to maintain that leadership on that broad portfolio of products. So we're set up for a great second half and another strong growth year as we head into 2019. I actually want to go back to the question about gross margins in Q4. And I wanted to see if you can segment out the pieces because it seems like the modem piece could maybe be a 200 basis point hit just by itself. So I wondered if you could maybe segment out some of the pieces between 10-nanometer, between the modem and between ASP. I just wanted to go back to the comments you were making as you were concluding your prepared remarks about demand challenges in the second half. Is that specific to Clients? Servers? And where is that coming from? And then, more importantly, does that open up another -- or a window for a competitor to wedge in and take some share from you? Just a quick one on the DCG op margins. So Data Center rev was up sequentially, but the op margins were down. I think you talked about the 10-nanometer yield issues. Was that all that was going on there? And so essentially, our DCG operating margins kind of capped at this 49%-and-change level. What -- when are these 10-nanometer headwinds going to go away and reverse and start to become tailwinds? Murthy, you might have actually answered this with your shortly after comment. But given some competitive threats in server in particular, are you guys thinking that you might ramp 10-nanometer server more quickly than you traditionally would after PC? Sorry about the gap earlier. A question for you on your evolving manufacturing strategy. It sounds like, as opposed to [copying exactly], we're moving to a world where you would consider building both 14 and 10 in the same factory. So curious what the implications of such a move are to gross margins and capital intensity as we look ahead. So looking at the fact that you're ramping for the first time a very high volume non-x86 architecture, what are the longer-term implications of something that you haven't discussed much more recently, which is the custom foundry business for the medium term?

INTC,Q3 2018,3083,2938,827,"Thank you, operator. And welcome, everyone, to Intel's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO earnings presentation that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The CFO earnings presentation is also available on the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined by Bob Swan, our interim CEO and Chief Financial Officer; and Murthy Renduchintala, Group President of the Technology, Systems Architecture & Client Group, and Chief Engineering Officer. Navin Shenoy and his wife are welcoming a new baby, and as a result, he won't be joining us today. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from Bob, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Mark. This summer, we celebrated our 50th anniversary, and this quarter was the best quarter in our 50-year history. Record quarterly revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19%. Our operating margins expanded 5 points, and earnings per share of $1.40 was up 39%. Our results were driven by incredibly strong demand and customer preference for the performance of our leadership products across the business. Our data center, client computing, Internet of Things, memory and Mobileye businesses all achieved record revenue. We expect 2018 to be the best year ever and our third record year in a row. Before we get deeper into the financials, I'll take a few minutes to talk about our strategy, our products and our people. First, our strategy. We are growing share in a larger TAM, driving operating leverage while increasing our R&D investments and delivering attractive capital returns. Our thesis is that the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand for the analysis, storage and sharing of data. We are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data revolution. And we've invested both organically and acquisitively to capitalize on these trends to accelerate the growth of the company while at the same time, delivering significant operating leverage and exiting noncore businesses. Our disciplined focus is delivering outstanding results. Demand in growth this year continue to exceed our expectations. Collectively, our data-centric businesses are up 22% year-to-date, led by growth in the cloud and communication service provider segments. In both our data centric and PC businesses, our CPU leadership puts us in a great position to capitalize on this massive data opportunity by delivering more value to a broader set of customers. We've expanded beyond CPUs with memory, modems, FPGAs and silicon for emerging high-growth workloads like ADAS, artificial intelligence and 5G communications. We acquired Mobileye, which has integrated Intel Architecture to produce the industry's leading ADAS and autonomous driving platforms. Mobileye also just announced the ability to fully retrofit existing vehicles to deliver full autonomy, moving Mobileye further up the value chain. The acquisitions of Altera and Movidius are enabling us to partner with customers to expand the markets that they serve. They're developing new AI capabilities by combining our Core products with our FPGAs and VPUs. This is most evident in computer vision applications, which cut across all of our IoT verticals. As a result, our opportunity has never been bigger. We are competing and winning share in a $300 billion TAM, transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company in the process. We now expect full year revenue to grow more than $8.4 billion over 2017. And in the first 9 months of the year, we have returned $12.6 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends or 112% of free cash flow. We've also achieved outstanding growth in our PC-centric business. After 7 years of decline, we expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year, and we continue to gain share in modems. We've focused our investments in the PC sector and the areas where we see growth and where our performance leadership and differentiation matters most, the commercial, gaming and 2-in-1 segments. Second, our products. Our strategy is delivering results because we have products that are solving our customers' problems. We're making the products we have even better and expanding our portfolio to deliver more value to customers. One of the most important things we do is collaborate with our customers and ecosystem partners to deliver exciting new computing experiences. We do that broadly with our OEMs. An example in our PC business was the launch of the stunning, new HP Spectre Folio, a 2-in-1 we worked closely with HP to develop. We leveraged our expertise in thermal tuning and motherboard miniaturization while achieving up to 19 hours battery life through power tuning and the use of Intel's low-power display technology. This sort of innovation is impossible without Intel's exceptionally broad range of IP and the scale and expertise to partner deeply with our customers on design. We also launched the new 9th Gen Intel Core desktop processors, including the world's best gaming processor. In our data-centric businesses, we announced 95 new performance world records for Xeon Scalable and continue to see strong adoption while we work with customers to get ready for the transition to Cascade Lake. Cascade Lake introduces hardware-based side channel mitigation, Intel DL Boost with 11x inference speed-up and a revolutionary new technology, Optane DC persistent memory. And we're deepening our engagement with customers on custom SKUs. In fact, we'll have 60% more custom SKUs in the Cascade Lake family than the prior generation. We shipped our first revenue units of Optane DC persistent memory to Google, Microsoft and Alibaba, and we're already receiving great feedback. Microsoft reported a new performance record of 13.7 million IOPs using Xeon Scalable and Optane, a level they said they've never seen with any other platform approach. Customers also continue to choose Intel as a partner as they use artificial intelligence to transform their businesses. Taboola chose Intel Xeon over GPUs for a massive inference speed-up and scale out across 7 data centers, delivering 360 billion content recommendations monthly. Rolls-Royce will design autonomous ships running inference on Xeon and are evaluating more of our portfolio in a multiyear engagement. Mobileye customer momentum continued with 8 new design wins at major U.S. and global automakers, bringing our 2018 design win total to 20. Mobileye also shipped 3.3 million EyeQ SoCs in the third quarter, bringing lifetime total to more than 33 million units. While our current product lineup is compelling, our road map is even more exciting. We continue to make good progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving, and we're on track for 10-nanometer-based systems on shelves during the holiday 2019 selling season. The breadth of IP we've assembled, combined with Intel's design, software, packaging and manufacturing capability, gives us an unmatched ability to invent the industry's future. Third, and most importantly, our people. Intel has amazing talent, including world-class scientists and engineers, and we are making excellent progress toward our commitment to a fully representative workforce. Intel employees are at their best when they're working together to address challenges. And faced with explosive and unexpected demand this year, they've exhibited incredible problem-solving skills to deliver this quarter's results. The PC TAM has returned to growth, and our data center business is growing at more than twice the rate we expected in January. Our full year revenue outlook is now more than $6 billion higher than our January forecast. And we have supply to support this revised guidance, thanks to outstanding responsiveness from our factory teams. We are focused on doing everything possible not to constrain our customers' growth. We've increased our CapEx by $1.5 billion since January to a record $15.5 billion. We've repositioned some 10-nanometer capacity to 14-nanometer, and we're making progress with our 10-nanometer process technology. Supply is tightest at the entry-level of the PC market and in our IoTG business. Within our CPU product lines, we're prioritizing the production of our Xeon and Core processors so that we and our customers can serve the high performance segments in the market. Our biggest challenge in Q4 will be meeting any additional PC and IoTG demand beyond our guidance, and we do expect fourth quarter upside from here will be limited. Summing it up, our strategy, leadership products and amazing people combined to produce the best quarter in the company's history. We're well on track to another record year. With that, let's turn to the details. Third quarter revenue of $19.2 billion was up 19% year-over-year. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 22%, and our PC-centric business was up 16%. Outstanding business performance, continued operating leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $6.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year. EPS of $1.40 was up 39% year-over-year. Year-to-date, we have generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow and returned $12.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends and $8.5 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 167 million shares. We continue to see strong momentum in our business and are raising our full year revenue guide by $1.7 billion to $71.2 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.38 versus July to $4.53 and our free cash flow guide by $500 million to $15.5 billion. Our revenue guidance for 2018 is up greater than $6 billion versus our January expectations as we focus on a strong finish to a record year. Our leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM as both our data-centric and PC-centric businesses grew at double-digit rates this quarter. Our data-centric businesses were up 22% as customers choose our performance products to move, store and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC-centric business was up 16% as we saw continued strength in the commercial and gaming PC segments and grew modem share. Operating income increased by more than $2 billion with margin up 5.1 points year-over-year in the third quarter, marking our highest operating margin percentage since 2011. EPS climbed to $1.40, up 39% year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the data center and client businesses leading to higher volumes and ASPs, continued growth in our adjacent businesses, a lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks. Our focus on operational efficiency continues to produce strong results. We now expect full year spending as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 29%, down about 7 points since 2015 while R&D is up $1.4 billion over the same period. We continue to improve our leverage while increasing investment in our key priorities such as product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Disciplined spending with a focus on prioritizing the most important investment opportunities is a key lever in magnifying our revenue opportunities and it's apparent in our results. Over the last 3 years, we've grown annual revenue by nearly $16 billion while adding less than $600 million in spending, resulting in a more than 25% increase in revenue per employee. Now some Q3 performance highlights by segment. The Data Center Group delivered its first $6 billion revenue quarter as it shipped more than 8 million CPUs into an annual server, storage, network and CPU TAM that is greater than 30 million units. Revenue of $6.1 billion was up 26% year-over-year, and operating income of $3.1 billion was up 37% year-over-year. Q3 operating margin was 50%. And we continue to see strong acceleration in both the cloud and comms service providers segments, which make up more than 2/3 of DCG revenue. Platform unit volume was up 15%, and ASPs were up 10%. Non-CPU adjacencies grew 14% over last year. The cloud business grew 50% year-over-year with strong growth trends across our diversified customer base. Our comms service providers segment grew 30% year-over-year as customers continue to transform their networks with Intel Architecture as they prepare for 5G. And our enterprise segment was up 1% year-over-year as a strong IT spending environment continued with CIOs prioritizing investment in private and hybrid cloud implementations. Our other data-centric businesses, IoTG, NSG and PSG, achieved solid growth in the third quarter and together were up 13% year-over-year or 17%, excluding Wind River. Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $919 million on broad business strength, up 8% or 19% excluding Wind River. Operating profit was $321 million, up 120% year-over-year on growing demand and revenue scale. Mobileye had record revenue of $191 million, up approximately 50% over last year as ADAS adoption continues to accelerate. Our memory business delivered record revenue of $1.1 billion, up 21% year-over-year as we continue to redefine the storage paradigm with industry-leading, low-cost, high-density NAND SSDs and the revolutionary performance of Optane drives. We have now reached the crossover point with 50% of our data center and client SSDs shifted to cost-effective, 64-layer 3D NAND, leading to rapidly improving cost per gigabyte. At the same time, as a result of pursuing 3D XPoint development independently and a tougher NAND pricing environment, we now expect NSG to be approximately breakeven for the full year. Micron recently announced their intent to call the IMFT factory. Our agreements with Micron ensure a reliable and cost-effective supply of 3D XPoint through at least 2020. And we have developed internal manufacturing options, which can be executed well within that time frame. PSG's revenue came in at $496 million, up 6% on strength in data center and comms segments. PSG's data center segment was up 45% over last year. In the advanced products category our 28-, 20- and 14-nanometer solutions grew 55%. Operating profit was $106 million, down 6% year-over-year. Finally, the Client Computing Group delivered exceptional results with its first $10 billion quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Commercial and gaming demand continued to be very strong. The notebook segment grew 13% year-over-year. The desktop segment grew 9% year-over-year. And client adjacencies grew 66% year-over-year, led by the 131% growth in our modem business. Operating profit grew $932 million year-over-year, while operating margin up 3.7 points. Leadership product performance and segmentation contribute to strong mix and higher ASPs. The investments we have made in the business organically and through acquisition are delivering excellent cash flow generation. Year-to-date, we have generated $22.5 billion in cash from operations. We have invested $11.3 billion in capital expenditures and delivered $11.2 billion in free cash flow, up 57% over the first 3 quarters of last year. During this period, we returned 112% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Buybacks totaled $8.5 billion, and dividends totaled $4.2 billion. In addition, settlements of our convertible debt reduced fully diluted shares by $22 million. Now turning to our full year outlook. We started the year in January expecting to generate $65 billion in revenue, 30% operating margin and $3.55 in EPS. 9 months later, the growth that we and the industry has seen has been remarkable. We couldn't be more pleased that in an increasingly competitive market, our customers are choosing Intel. Our leadership products are winning across our data-centric businesses, and we're seeing strong demand upside in the client business that not long ago many thought was in perpetual decline. We are now forecasting revenue of approximately $71.2 billion, up $1.7 billion versus our expectations in July. This represents a $6.2 billion increase versus the expectations we set just 9 months ago. We now expect data-centric growth to be approximately 20% year-over-year and PC-centric growth to be around 9% year-over-year. Our outlook for operating margin is approximately 34.5%, up 2.5 points from July as we now expect to deliver 29% spending to revenue, not only hitting our original goal 2 years early, but beating it. We expect the full year tax rate of around 12%, down slightly from our prior estimate. Overall, we expect strong top line growth and improving operating leverage will drive EPS to $4.53, up $0.38 from our estimate in July. As a result of increased demand, we are raising our forecast for gross CapEx to $15.5 billion or approximately $14 billion net of memory prepayments. We are now expecting free cash flow of $15.5 billion, up $500 million from July. For Q4, we are forecasting revenue of approximately $19 billion, up 11% year-over-year. We expect operating margins of approximately 34.5% and gross margin of approximately 62%. We also expect EPS at $1.22, up 38% excluding equity adjustments from business growth, spending leverage and a lower tax rate. We expect DCG to set another revenue record of approximately $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Due to supply constraints, we anticipate IoTG revenue will be down approximately 15% sequentially. As we look forward to 2019, we expect to deliver another record year for the company. We'll have more to say about 2019 in January, but we're expecting that our operating margin percentage will be approximately flat next year. We expect gross margins to remain in the upper half of our historical 55% to 65% range. And while we expect 2019 gross margin percentage to be down slightly from Q4 '18 levels as we continue to gain share in our adjacent businesses and we ramp our 10-nanometer process, that will be offset by increasing OpEx leverage as we continue to make thoughtful trade-offs and invest in R&D that will accelerate our growth and profitability. And we expect the full year tax rate to be up a couple points following several beneficial discrete events in 2018. Five years ago, we set out to transform Intel from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Today, our strategy, our products and our people are delivering on that ambition with strong growth, record results and the largest TAM opportunity in the company's history. And we're just getting started. With that, let me turn it back over to Mark and we'll get to your questions. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.","Yes. Harlan, this is Murthy. Let me take that one. Yes, you're correct. We still intend to be making first shipments of Cascade Lake by Q4. And we're really excited with the stockpile of new features we have lined up for that platform, primarily the support of our Optane persistent memory that we'll launch in conjunction with Cascade Lake as we enter early 2019, we believe that will be a significant uplift in performance. We will also have a dedicated instruction set extensions to support artificial intelligence workloads. And we'll have continued generation over generation CPU improvements. So all in all, we think that Cascade Lake represents a power-packed addition to the data center road map. And of course, we have further excitement towards the end of next year as we launch our Cooper Lake platform as well. So we're really excited about the lineup we have in our DCG road map for next year and indeed, as you said, for the end of this quarter. Yes. First, I think the progress we made has been a team sport. And as I indicated in the prepared remarks, we're down 700 basis points from 2015. And during that time frame, it's not been at the expense of R&D, it's -- on the contrary, R&D has been -- has grown $1.4 billion during that time frame. So really, the underlying dynamics is we've made trade-offs to invest in higher growth segments of the business. That growth is, in fact, accelerating. And from that accelerating growth, we've been extremely disciplined on getting leverage on our SG&A, and we've exited some, what I'd characterize, noncore businesses. During the course of this year, we exited Wind River. We reduced our investments in wearables, products. And we exited these Saffron business as well. So as we go forward, we're going to continue to increase R&D. But -- and we're going to increase it in the areas that we think can generate differentiated growth for us. And from that growth, we expect to continue to get leverage as we go into -- as we enter 2019. First, John, as we mentioned earlier, the -- we were caught off guard a little bit this year by explosive growth well ahead of what our expectations were back in the beginning of the year. And that growth came from all different segments in the business. It put us in the unfortunate situation of constraining some of the demand signals that we were seeing from the market and our customer base. Our teams have done -- in conjunction with our customers, our teams have done an outstanding job in the third quarter and we project into the fourth quarter. And that has enabled us to increase our revenue outlook for the year by $1.7 billion. But I think as we go into the fourth quarter, given the demand signals we continue to see across the business, we, in fact, will be constraining growth. Our focus has been prioritizing in conjunction with our customers, Xeon and Core processors. And therefore, by definition, the lower end of PC and the IoT business is being constrained. So we are in a constrained scenario into the fourth quarter, both at low end PC and in IoT. As we go into next year and kind of the timing, we've put a lot of capital to work this year. It's a record year for CapEx for us at $15.5 billion. It's a $1.5 billion higher than what we expected entering the year. And we have kind of taken some of our 10-nanometer equipment tools and began to blow that back to meet the increased demand for 14. So we're working extremely hard to get back on track in 2019. But at this stage of the game, given the demand signals we've seen in the fourth quarter, we're going to be constrained a little bit. And we're trying to prioritize as best as we can with our customers. Yes. I think on CapEx at the macro level as we think into '19, we expect logic CapEx to likely be a little higher, and memory CapEx, despite building self-sufficiency on Optane, to be a little bit lower. So at the macro level, those are the dynamics. The -- in terms of how it plays out on overall levels, it's still a work in process. And I'd characterize it, Ambrish, this way. First, it's going to be a function of growth. As we get clear around what growth looks like in 2019 for 14-nanometer, that will impact what the overall CapEx level is. Secondly, if we -- we've made some good progress on 10-nanometer yields over the course of the last 6 months. And as we progress through in the -- through the fourth quarter into 2019, if we're further ahead on 10-nanometer yields, that will influence the amount of CapEx next year. Third, our progress on 7-nanometer, how well we progress in 7-nanometer is also -- will influence how we think about CapEx. And last but not least, as it relates to memory, it's more the customer quals and adoption of our leading edge, 3D NAND 96-layer product as we continue to make progress on developing that. We may deploy that capital, and that pays for itself very quickly. So as we sit here today, CapEx -- I expect logic to be up, memory to be down. And as we look at those 4 things, all of which I'd characterize as being good things if we made progress on all 4 of those, that will influence the rate of CapEx spend next year. So we'll try to provide you a little more analytical color versus that qualitative cover in January. Wanted to get -- just give us a little more color on the PC numbers in the quarter. How much were you constrained by the shortages that you saw? And I guess, it looks like you grew a little bit more than seasonal on a sequential basis. And how much of the ASP lift that you saw do you think was a function of those shortages? And then just any color on could those shortages spread higher into this product stack over the course of Q4? Yes, Joe. I think as you saw from the IDC and Gartner folks, growth for PC TAM in the quarter, probably around 1%. Our guess is it was probably a little bit stronger than that, 1% to 2% growth. And within that, we delivered 6% unit growth. So real strong unit growth and again, good ASP momentum. I would say in Q3, largely a function of customer collaboration in our fabs. I don't think we're too terribly constrained on the PC side to be honest with you. I think as we go into Q4 is where I think the constraints are impacting us a little bit more. So I don't think ASPs or supply constraints really -- we did not benefit from higher ASPs, nor were we constrained in terms of unit growth in the quarter. It's more a fourth quarter thing where demand signals remained relatively strong. And as you saw from our guide, while it's good year-on-year growth, it's relatively flat on -- overall on Q3 to Q4. And PCs -- low end of PCs and IoT will be impacted as we see the demand signals at this stage of the game. Yes. It's a great question. I think at the aggregate level, there's what I'd maybe characterize as some decent tailwinds as we go -- as we exit the year and then go into '19 but also some headwinds. The tailwinds, we've -- as you know, we've been talking about an expanded TAM where we play a bigger and bigger role in the increased needs for data. And that larger TAM and the momentum we're building across all of our products is a pretty good tailwind as we look at just demand for data, whether it's with consumers or with businesses going into the new year. That's a tailwind. Secondly, Murthy mentioned a few of the products that we have coming in down the pipe in fourth quarter and going in the next year. And those products, we believe, will deliver more and more performance for our clients, which I'd characterize as a tailwind. And then third in somewhat of a perverse way, as you know, when PC was 70% of the business and when enterprise was 50-plus percent of the data center business and those were declining, it was the headwind for the company's growth. But those more recently have been stable. So whether it's our expanded TAM, our new products or the mix of our business, we have some tailwinds as we think about 2019. At the same time, to your point, there's some headwinds. And the headwinds, first, this has been a fantastic year for us and I think for the industry, and that just makes comps a little bit tougher as we go into next year. Second, we have growing competition. And growing competition can be a headwind for us. And our expectations are we'll deal with that pretty effectively. And third, just global trade. In particular, as you know, China's a big market for us. We got some important customers there, and it's important -- it's an important part of our global supply chain. So as that -- as this most recent round of tariffs kind of play out and we're doing a lot of work with our customers to ensure that the global supply chain can be adjusted and adapted to deal with any tariffs that come down the way, but it's -- I think it's going to be a wait-and-see as we go into 2019. At this stage of the game, we don't see any impact on 2018's results. And in 2019, we have what I'd consider a world-class supply chain team that can manage and weather the dynamics of changes in movements of goods better than anybody else in the industry. So I think that would be a competitive advantage for us as we go into next year. Well, I think, first, we've -- in terms of growth for next year in the aggregate, we haven't really provided any quantitative color, more qualitative cover in terms of the dynamics that we see. That being said, our DCG growth this year is projected to be north of 20%, real strong for the first 3 quarters of the year. So fourth quarter, we expect really solid demand. But it's on a tough -- much tougher comp because fourth quarter last year was a great quarter for the DCG business. As we go into next year, we got -- Murthy highlighted, we've got a good product road map of expanded features for Cascade Lake as we exit this year, Cooper Lake, middle of next year. And we have a much more diverse business now with -- obviously, cloud has been a big accelerant for us. I don't expect that it will grow at 50% forever. 50% was our cloud growth in the quarter. But at the same time, our comms and networking business growth has been accelerating quite a bit, and the stability we've seen in enterprise and government has really helped. So I think next year, we have a much more diverse business. We got a good product lineup and we'll provide a little more color as we get into January. But outstanding year, this year, for data center, both top line and bottom line. Yes, yes, great question. First, a little color on Q3, and then I'll walk from Q3 to Q4 dynamics. Yes, it's as the -- we highlighted in the materials, 60% -- almost 66% gross margin in the quarter is high as it's been for a very long time. And it was a function of a few things: One, continued volume leverage with full factories; two, ASPs, both on a client side and on the data center side. And those were partially offset by platform cost going up and a change in mix, a growth of our modem and memory business. So those are the 4 dynamics that played out during the course of the quarter. I would say 66% was artificially high, and I'd say that for a couple of reasons. One, we had in our -- in the NSG business, we earned a government incentive that was from scaling our fabs outside the U.S. So that incentive was worth about $110 million. So a bit of a one-timer that we don't expect to repeat itself. Secondly, sell-through of product, either -- on the CPU side, we're working with our customers and shaping demand to where we had inventory. We had good sell-through for some inventory that was previously partially reserved. And then second, on our modem growth, our explosive modem growth in the quarter. We PRQ'd that product in the third quarter. So we got the benefit of previously fully reserved inventory. So what all that means when you adjust for kind of one-timers, the 66% is closer to 64% in terms of normalized basis going into the fourth quarter. Our guide in the fourth quarter, to your question, is 62%. So there's really 3 dynamics that we see playing out in the fourth quarter. One, we expect ASPs to be better. And that's going to be a little bit of a function of the prioritization of Xeon and Core processors, which are higher ASP mix. So we expect that to benefit us. But at the same time, there's 3 other things that as we go into the fourth quarter that I'd characterized as really good things but will have an impact on our gross margin. One is ramping 10-nanometer. We're making good progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving, and that's giving us the confidence to, in effect, turn on more equipment and incur the depreciation cost associated with that. So that will impact our Q3 to Q4 gross margins. And it's a function of the progress we're making on 10-nanometer. Second, memory continues to grow, a good 21% growth in the third quarter. We expect it to continue to grow in the fourth quarter. And that has -- our NAND business has been profitable during the course of the year but not at the gross margins of our logic business. And then third, we're experiencing explosive growth on modem with some really good share gains. And the modem product is also -- the combination of memory and modem are accretive to our year-on-year earnings growth but dilutive to our gross margins. So that's the kind of Q3 adjusted gross margin going into Q4 will likely cost us roughly a couple points. As we then step back and think about 2019, those -- we see those same dynamics playing out, primarily 14-nanometer volume. So continued good yield, unit cost performance on 14-nanometer. We don't expect ASPs to be dramatically better in an increasingly competitive environment, but we don't expect them to be much worse. 10-nanometer costs will ramp. And we do expect to continue to grow memory and modem. It'll be accretive to earnings but a little dilutive to gross margin. So again, a fairly long-winded walk from what drove Q3. The goodness operationally of what will happen to Q4 gross margins has been our comfort that 2019 will be a modest degradation. But when coupled with the leverage on our operating expense, our operating margins will be kind of roughly flat in the 34% range. And operator, I think we've got time for 2 more questions. Bob, just one more on 10-nanometer. You mentioned it's on track. Is there a way to kind of quantify progress on 10-nanometer over the last 3 months? And if you were to kind of go back to a similar time when you were getting ready to make the jump to 14-nanometer, are the 10-nanometer yields and cost behaving in a similar way? Just any color around progress would be helpful. Vivek, let me take that. This is Murphy. First of all, as Bob said in his opening remarks, the progress we've made in the quarter is very much in line with our expectations. While we can't give any specific numbers, I do believe that the yields as we speak now are tracking roughly in line with what we experienced in 14-nanometer. So we're still very much reinforcing and reaffirming our previous guidance that we believe that we'll have 10-nanometer shipping by holiday of 2019. And if anything, I feel more confident about that at this call than I did in the call a quarter ago. So we're making good progress, and I think we're making the quarter-on-quarter progress that's consistent with prior generations having reset the progress curve. Well, it's -- we haven't really given a time line for 7, so to say it's ramping earlier would be a little bit of a stretch. But this is -- we've been investing in EUV for a while, and we've obviously been investing in 7-nanometer. And when we step back and think about CapEx for next year, again, it's a function of growth on 14. It's a function of the rate in which we scale 10, and it's a function of investments we'd make to begin to prove out 7 in a more meaningful way. So those are just the dynamics that we're looking at and thinking about as we get closer to giving you a more definitive guide for CapEx in '19. All right. Thank you all for joining us today. Operator, please go ahead and wrap up the call.","On the competitive front, with your nearest competitor rolling out a second generation, 7-nanometer server product next year, I guess first question is, is the Intel team still on track to roll out its second-generation Xeon family, the Cascade Lake at the end of this year? And if you could just help us understand, what are some of the performance and portfolio differentiators that are going to help the team maintain relatively strong share in the server segment, 2019 and beyond? Bob, you've done a great job in managing OpEx since coming on board. You talked about further leverage into 2019. Can you remind us which areas of the business you're deemphasizing from a spending perspective? And how should we think about the balance between R&D and SG&A in 2019 and beyond? Well, I wonder if you can just comment a little bit on when do you think the supply constraints will be over relative to your sort of capacity addition plans. And if I caught it right, it sounds like in the calendar fourth quarter, you're choosing to kind of shortchange the IoT Group. Does that mean that you're already kind of caught up in the PC market? Or how should we be thinking about that dynamic? But one area you did not touch on was CapEx. And I'm asking if you could provide us some directional input on that on what we should expect for CapEx, specifically in light of the Micron call option and implications that has for your spend on the memory side. I just wanted to ask a little bit. I get the demand's really good here in the back half of 2019, but with the trade war discussions, softening demand in China, some cycle risk indicators, are you seeing anything or talking to customers that would indicate that there would be any first half 2019 risk to demand? I wanted to ask on the DCG. You're not specifically guiding it next year, but it sounds like you're still pretty bullish. And there's a lot of investors, I think, worried about a hyperscale CapEx slow down next year. So I guess, is it that you're bullish on CapEx next year? Or is it kind of more a commentary on product cycle, maybe Xeon Scalable beginning to catalyze kind of a server upgrade cycle? Bob, I want to ask on the gross margins side. First, thank you for the color you gave on 2019. But if I back it up a step, what's the headwinds in the fourth quarter sequentially? And then any big picture moving parts, 10-nanometer yields, mix, what have you that gives you the confidence that you could still stay in the upper half of that 55% to 65% range for 2019? Bob, you've -- you said that progress on 7-nanometer will also be a factor driving CapEx next year. And I was hoping you could maybe talk about that a little bit more. When you talk about progress, is that a statement about yields meaning if 7-nanometer yields are improving, you could potentially deploy more CapEx to ramp that process note a little earlier?

INTC,Q1 2019,2937,3246,1004,"Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's Second Quarter 2018 (sic) [First Quarter 2019] Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by Bob Swan, our interim CEO and Chief Financial Officer; Murthy Renduchintala, Group President of the Technology, Systems Architecture and Client Group and Chief Engineering Officer; as well as Navin Shenoy, Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Data Center Group. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from Bob followed by Q&A. (technical difficulty) We're having technical difficulties. Let me jump back in here. I'm joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; our CFO, George Davis; and in a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when we describe our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Mark. With the interim introduction, I thought on our outlook I was getting demoted already. But look, coming off a record 2018, our top line results came in slightly higher than expectations, with upsides in the PC and IoT segments, offset by incremental NAND pricing weakness. Total revenue of $16.1 billion was flat year-over-year, as our PC-centric business grew 4% and our data-centric businesses were down 5%. The team executed well, though underlying trends are concerning, and as a result, we've revised our expectations down for the full year. I'll give you some insight into the customer trends informing our outlook, but first, I'd like to take a few minutes to recap the progress we've made over the first quarter. It's been just under 3 months since I was honored with the best job in the world. At that time, I said that our leadership team would focus relentlessly on delivering for our customers to take advantage of the biggest opportunity in our company's history. We're making important progress by intensifying our focus in 3 key areas: expanding our TAM, accelerating innovation and improving our execution while evolving our culture. I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our philosophy and progress in each of those areas. First, expanding our TAM. We are transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, and our ambitions are bigger than they've ever been. Our aim is to identify and capitalize on key technology inflections that set us up to play a larger role in our customers' success while improving returns for our owners. You can see the impact of this approach in our Q1 execution. For example, our first-ever data-centric portfolio launch marked an important milestone in our efforts to capitalize on the AI opportunity and undisputed technology inflection. Our new second-generation Xeon Scalable is the only processor in the industry with built-in artificial intelligence acceleration. Not only did we deliver a 14x generation-over-generation performance improvement, but we also showed CPU performance beating GPU performance on major AI workloads like recommendation engines. And we worked closely with the software industry ahead of the launch to deliver a great out-of-the-box experience for customers like Siemens. They're collaborating with us on a breakthrough AI-based cardiac MRI model. This application has the potential to provide real-time diagnosis using the DL Boost technology in our newest Xeon Scalable processor. Another TAM-expanding business that continues to gain traction is Mobileye, with 8 new global ADAS designs in the first quarter alone, including our first win in India. Mobileye's real-time crowd-sourced mapping technology, Road Experience Management or REM, continues to build momentum with a major North American automaker adopting this breakthrough data-centric capability. Autonomous driving is a technology inflection that we're ready to lead. 2019 will be a foundational year for another disruptive technology, 5G. As you know, we recently sharpened our 5G focus. When it became apparent that we don't have a clear path to profitability in 5G smartphone modems, we acted. We are now winding down that business and conducting a strategic assessment of 5G modems for the PC and IoT sectors while continuing to meet our current 4G customer commitments. By acting now, we focus our 5G efforts on the transformation of the wireless network and edge infrastructure, where we have a clear technology advantage, market share to win and a strategic role to play with customers. At Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated a range of 5G products under development, including the 5G-ready N3000 FPGA acceleration card and the new 10-nanometer-based Snow Ridge network SoC for use in 5G base stations. As networks cloudify, Intel is in a great position to win in this base station segment, where we expect to grow to 40% market segment share by 2022. The vast majority of the 5G market opportunity and profit is in the transformation of network and edge infrastructure, where we are now laser focused. Next, accelerating innovation. Successfully competing in a bigger TAM requires a broad range of products and technologies. Only Intel has the breadth of IP to deliver leadership products across increasingly diverse workloads for the data-centric era. Harnessing data for discovery, invention and business value is not a one-size-fits-all computing challenge. That's why we are investing in 6 important pillars of innovation: process technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security features and software. Already this year, we've introduced incredible examples of this approach to innovation across the business. Let me take a minute to talk about a few. We are currently architecting what we expect will be the United States' first exascale supercomputer for the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory. This supercomputer, called Aurora, will be delivered in 2021 and powered by Intel technologies designed specifically for the convergence of artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. These include a future generation of the Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Intel's Xe compute architecture, a future generation of Optane persistent memory and Intel's One API software. It's a great example of how our data-centric products architected together can deliver technology breakthroughs for our customers. We are also accelerating innovation in our PC-centric business. For example, our team is hard at work with our OEM customers to define and deliver a stunning new class of next-generation laptops. We call this Project Athena, and the first of these sleek, beautiful designs are coming in the second half of 2019. And just this week, we launched the most powerful generation of Intel Core mobile processors ever, designed for gamers and content creators. On the process technology front, our teams executed well in Q1 and our velocity is increasing. We remain on track to have volume client systems on shelves for the holiday selling season. And over the past 4 months, the organization drove a nearly 2x improvement in the rate at which 10-nanometer products moved through our factories. Finally, execution and culture. This is about concentrating our resources on the vital few programs that will have an impact on our customers' success and our owners' return, rather than the trivial many. Over the last couple of years, that focus has resulted in exiting McAfee and wearables business, shutting down Saffron and divesting Wind River. And our spending as a percentage of revenue has gone from approximately 36% to about 30% this quarter. It has allowed us to invest more of our resources, and just as importantly, our collective attention and focus, where it really counts. By doing fewer things, we'll execute better at the things that matter most. Specific areas where we need to improve execution include meeting customer demand and delivering on our 10-nanometer lineup of products, and we are making progress. Our supply constraints have had a disruptive impact on our customers and ecosystem. We've committed never again to be a constraint on our customers' growth. We've increased capacity to improve our position in the second half, although product mix will continue to be a challenge in the third quarter as our teams align available supply with customer demand. As I shared earlier, our confidence in 10-nanometer is also improving. In addition to the manufacturing velocity improvement I described earlier, we expect to qualify our first volume 10-nanometer product, Icelake, this quarter and are increasing our 10-nanometer volume goals for the year. I'll shift now to our full year outlook. Going forward, George will deliver our forecast. But given this is his third week with us, I'll share my thoughts on our full year reset and he'll review our first quarter results and second quarter guide. Our conversations with customers and partners across our PC and data-centric businesses over the past couple of months have made several trends clear. The decline in memory pricing has intensified. The data center inventory and capacity digestion that we described in January is more pronounced than we expected, and China headwinds have increased, leading to a more cautious IT spending environment. And yet those same customer conversations reinforce our confidence that demand will improve in the second half. So we've reassessed our '19 expectations based on the challenges we're seeing. Our full year outlook is now $69 billion in revenue, down 3% year-over-year and down approximately $2.5 billion from our previous estimate. Given the magnitude of change, we'll be somewhat more granular in explaining the drivers. We now see data-centric revenue down low single digits year-over-year, with DCG down mid-single digits year-over-year off a tough compare, continued China weakness and inventory and capacity absorption. We are also anticipating an incrementally more challenging NAND pricing environment. Our PC-centric forecast remains unchanged at low single digits. We are forecasting operating margin to be 32%, down approximately 3 points year-over-year and down approximately 2 points from our previous guide. This outlook reflects lower full year revenue and a year-over-year decline in gross margins as a result of the 10-nanometer ramp and NAND pricing. We continue to see good discipline on spending and expect our exit from the 5G smartphone modem segment, annualized in 2018 spending actions, and incremental spending efficiencies to reduce OpEx by approximately $1 billion year-over-year, partially offsetting the impact of lower gross margin. We now forecast full year EPS at $4.35 per share, down approximately 5% year-over-year and $0.25 from our previous guide. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 12%, up 1 point year-over-year and down 1.5 points versus our prior guide, largely as a result of lower pretax income. Before I hand the call over to George, I'd like to welcome him as Intel's new CFO. I've known George for a long time from his CFO days at Applied Materials while I was a board member. He brings deep industry knowledge from prior roles. He's a true team player and he cares deeply about people development and diversity. George will review our first quarter financials and second quarter guide, then we'll get to your questions. George? Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm delighted to be at Intel and look forward to regularly engaging with our key stakeholders. Revenue for our first quarter came in at $16.1 billion, flat year-on-year and slightly higher than our guide. Data-centric revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5%; and PC-centric revenue was $8.6 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Q1 operating margin was 28%, down 2 points due to cost of our 10-nanometer ramp and NAND reserves, partially offset by platform ASP strength as supply constraints at the low end in CCG led to an especially rich mix as well as lower spending overall. Q1 EPS came in at $0.89, up 2% versus the prior year and $0.02 over what we guided for the quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow; returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including dividends of $1.4 billion; and repurchased approximately 49 million shares. We are pleased with the team's focused execution for the quarter. We anticipated a challenging start to 2019, and that's what we have encountered. We also knew that the timing of our 10-nanometer ramp would pressure margins in the first quarter. And while we continue to make progress on the road map, that pressure remains a factor. We see customers becoming more cautious in their buying patterns, with the most acute deceleration happening in China. Demand pressure is particularly evident in our data center business, where we are seeing a continuing inventory correction in enterprise and comms and capacity digestion among cloud service providers who ramped consumption strongly in 2018. Non-GAAP EPS was up 2% year-over-year driven by strength in our client and IoT ASPs, lower spending, lower shares outstanding and the McAfee dividend received in the quarter. Offsetting factors were continued NAND pricing pressure, 10-nanometer ramp cost and weak enterprise and government data center demand. Our tax rate came in at 12.5%, up almost 1 point year-over-year due to nonrecurring benefits in Q1 of 2018. We continue to improve our operating efficiency year-over-year from 32.4% to 30.3% spending as a percent of revenue. Total spending was down 7% year-over-year in the quarter as we drove efficiencies in our SG&A spending and kept R&D spending flat compared to the prior year. Within that overall flat R&D spend, we are making thoughtful trade-offs so that we can amplify the investments into key priorities to grow the business. This has resulted in more investment in 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer process technology and accelerating road maps in DCG and CCG and in key growth areas like autonomous driving, AI and 5G network infrastructure. Let me now break down our performance by segment. Our Data Center Group ended the quarter with revenue of $4.9 billion, down 6% from the prior year and 19% sequentially within our expected range of sequential decline, given the headwinds we noted last quarter. Against the challenging year-over-year compare, platform units were down 8%. We saw record Xeon ASPs as customers continue to select high-performance products. We also saw a strong ramp of network SoCs, resulting in moderation of our blended platform ASP. Non-CPU adjacencies were up 2% driven by strength in network ASICs and silicon photonics. Cloud revenue grew 5% year-over-year in the first quarter as cloud service providers absorbed capacity put in place in 2018. Enterprise and government revenue declined by 21%, and comms service provider revenue declined 4% year-over-year in the first quarter as both enterprise and comms customers worked through inventory and China demand weakened. Overall, our data-centric businesses were flat year-over-year. Our IoT businesses saw 19% revenue growth adjusted for Wind River and operating income growth of 11% year-on-year due to a mix shift to higher core products in the quarter, with the growth of compute-intensive applications like AI and computer vision. Mobileye had record revenue, up 38% due to an extended -- expanded product portfolio and customer base. Our memory business was down 12% due to continued NAND pricing pressures, offset by NAND data center and client bit growth. Operating income for this group is down driven by NAND ASP deterioration and demand softness, resulting in inventory revaluations. The PSG group declined 2% year-on-year due to weakness in cloud and enterprise, partially offset by strength in wireless and advanced node products. The Client Computing Group showed continued growth, with revenue up 4% year-over-year. Platform revenue was up 3% driven by strength in large commercial and gaming. Modem drove the majority of strength in the adjacencies, resulting in a 26% increase over the prior year. We have added supply capacity and continue working closely with our customers to align our available supply to their demand. However, supply of our PC processors and chipsets remains tight, particularly for our small core products as we prioritize big core. We saw strong ASP growth in desktop and notebook in part due to the small core constraints, but also on strong performance in gaming. Constraints were also responsible for the year-over-year decline in volume. This quarter, we generated $5 billion in operating cash flow, and we invested $3.3 billion to expand our 14-nanometer capacity and ramp 10-nanometer. We raised the dividend by 5% and repurchased 49 million shares. Let me wrap up with our Q2 outlook. We expect Q2 revenue to be $15.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year. Our data-centric businesses are expected to decline in the high single digits year-over-year as memory pricing declines weigh on our NAND business and DCG customers continue to consume inventory and absorb capacity. We expect DCG to be approximately flat sequentially. The PC-centric segment is expected to decline in the high single digits on declining PC ASPs on a relative mix of more small core units. Operating margin in Q2 is expected to be 29%, down 4 points year-over-year on lower platform revenue, the 4G modem ramp and NAND pricing. We forecast earnings per share of $0.89, flat sequentially and down $0.15 year-over-year. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter to be 11.5%. I will conclude here and turn the call back to Mark. Great. Thank you, George. After that eventful start to the call, we'll now move on to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.","Yes, it's lots of movement going on in the gross margin line. I'd start by saying implied in our guide for the first half is roughly 60%, so it implies a little increase off of Q1. And our implied guide then for full year is almost 60%. So through all the ups and downs, there's going to be quite a bit of consistency. That being said, the Q1 will likely be the lowest, because as I indicated in my prepared remarks, that we're going to -- we intend to qualify the 10-nanometer part in the second quarter. So what that means is in the first quarter, all of our 10-nanometer cost is flowing through cost of sales. When we qualify, it goes on the balance sheet. And then when we sell those previously reserved units in the third quarter, those units go out with no cost. So the dynamics imply low Q1 and a much stronger Q3, but through it all, fairly stable at roughly 60% level. On the year-on-year decline, obviously, the NSD -- sorry, NSG pricing is having a real impact on us. We expect NSG for the year to be down roughly 10% almost, and that is primarily driven by significant change in pricing dynamics during the course of the year. So that'll be a headwind for us throughout the year. Aaron, sorry, I should probably add something, Mark. The one last thing is, as we indicated, we expect to have systems on shelf in the fourth quarter or for holiday season, so -- and that given the progress we've made on 10, we're going to be shifting more units in the fourth quarter than we previously anticipated. So all else equal, that implies Q4 would a little bit lower than the full year guide. With regards to DCG being down mid-single digits for the year, I understand the issues in the first half. But it seems like the cloud guys were -- the CapEx has been okay, and I thought we had a little bit more snap back in the back half. Can you just talk a little bit more about the dynamics, specifically on the cloud side, and related to your -- the inventory that they may have of your parts there? Yes. Joe, as you know, the -- we came off a very strong 2018, up 21%. As we came into the year, implied in our guide, particularly in Q1, was our expectations that we'd be in quite a digestion period, both for enterprise and government but cloud as well and that, that would really impact our Q1. Look, what we're highlighting today as it relates to cloud is 2 things: that we expect the digestion to continue into Q2; that demand is going to be soft in Q2. And it's even exacerbated in China where, if you'll remember, through the third quarter last year, our demand for cloud players in China was close to triple digits. That was negative in the first quarter. So overall, they're still in a digestion period, the cloud guys. And in China is even -- it's been even more dramatic in the first quarter and the first couple weeks here in the second quarter. That being said, when we asked that, when we look at end demand in this data-centric environment, when we're looking at end demand, it still seems relatively strong. And the -- in our dialogues with our customers, they are implying an uptick as we move from first half into second half. Yes, it's a great question. Truly, we believe that there's the end demand, and forget about which segment, but end demand remains relatively strong. But by segment, enterprise and government year-on-year decline was not way off what we expected, because we didn't have a real robust guide for Q1, but we have seen it continue into the second quarter. And I just think that the ordering ahead or the digestion of last year's strong growth, we expect now just to continue in enterprise and government through the first half and even a little more into the second half as it relates to E&G. Yes, we kind of -- as we came in -- the updated guide, the guide now is more a unit story. When we came into the year, back in January, our expectation on ASPs is they would be pressured in DCG by 2 things in particular: one, just we indicated at the time that we expected an increased competitive environment as we go into the second half; and then two, as we look at 5G SoCs beginning to ramp as we go into the fourth quarter, they tend to be at lower ASPs. So we expect product enhancements but offset by tougher competitive environment and mix of SoCs for the comms service providers. So the big change from January is really more a unit story. And we think we bounded the ASPs best we could back in January time frame. That hasn't changed. Yes, let me -- C.J., let me take a run and ask George to chime in as well. We announced that we were going to exit the 5G smartphone business and that we are going to evaluate the 5G Modem in other applications, like PC and IoT, while assessing our alternatives as it relates to the 5G Modem overall. So what's reflected in kind of the updated guide we gave is we do expect lower spending for 5G smartphone as we go through the course of the year. That is part of the lower spending going into the second half that we reflected. But we also -- we haven't really completed our assessment about what to do with the wonderful IP that we've developed, the real strong team that we have and the other opportunities we have, whether it's in network infrastructure, where we're really excited about the role we'll play in 5G, or whether it's the role that 5G Modem plays in these non-smartphone applications. So that's something that we're working very hard on to try to get to the right answer about how we'll deal with the technologies we built, the capabilities we have and what the implications will be on cost structure as we go into the second half of the year and into next year. So that's still a work in progress. And C.J., I just might add, we talk about spending being down $1 billion year-over-year, I would say the expectations for slowing 5G spend or reducing 5G smartphone spend prior to getting through the decision process of -- that we're going through right now, is maybe 20% to 30% of that. So there is not a lot yet evident in the spend rate that we're talking about that results from the 5G Modem business. Yes. Thanks, John. First, in the first quarter, kind of 2 things that really impacted gross margin: one, frankly, we planned for and played out as we expected; and two, we did not plan for. But the one we planned for is just as we ramp 10, and as you're aware and I mentioned earlier, until we qualify the product, which we expect to do in the second quarter, all that cost flows through cost of sales. So when we're in early stages of ramp prior to qualification, that does compress gross margin. And that played out as we expected, because I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our progress and our improvement on 10-nanometer yields was in line with what we've expected coming into the year, a little bit better, that gave us the comfort that we're going to increase volume at the end of the year. But Q1 is just the dynamics of all of that ramp cost going through cost of sales. That was planned and that was anticipated. The not planned in the quarter was just the ASP declined much greater than we had anticipated for NSG. We were in the -- we were expecting kind of mid-20s to 30% ASP declines. The reality is it was closer to the mid-40s. And as a result, and George flagged this, but as a result, we had to take a lower cost or market reserve against our inventory balance in the quarter. That cost us over 1 point of gross margins in the quarter. That we did not quite anticipate. So gross margin Q1, in line with kind of what we thought, with the exception of inventory reserves that we took in the quarter. And as I said, Q2, we expect it to be better than Q1 because we'll begin to capitalize those costs because of the progress we're making on 10-nanometer. And then just to kind of go from your Q1 to your 5 years out point of view, I guess maybe on the gross margin, operating margin dynamics, maybe we'll defer that, kick the can couple of weeks, until we see you on May 8 when we kind of walk through our longer-range planning process. Yes. First, maybe just some context on when we talk about expanded TAM, the -- maybe the criteria we think about and then I'll try to apply them to where we are in memory. First, we look for technology inflections where we think we have a real advantage, whether it's process manufacturing or performance-oriented design that is worth pursuing, number one; number two, such that we can play a more important role in the success of our customers; and third, in an area where we think we can get attractive returns for our investors. So those are our -- the 3 criteria that we're applying, and we're going to be increasingly disciplined on the third aspect of those criteria. As it relates to memory, we have a high-performance Optane product that we think is really differentiated, coupled with our CPU that can do things best in industry that's really needed to keep pace with the increased performance of CPU processing. So strategically, we think it's really important. Technically, we think we have a real advantage. And third, we think we can get good returns. As it relates to NAND, we think we have process technology advantage. We're in the stage where we've gone from 32-layer to 64-layer now. The profitability of the NAND business pre this massive decline in ASPs was okay last year as we were ramping the business. And our challenge going forward is we're just going to have to execute better on the NAND business, so we can check that third box of attractive returns for our investors. And I don't want to -- when the market's plummeting I don't want to conclude what the right decision is. I want to maybe look through the horizon a little bit to get to the right decision. But clearly, we got to generate more attractive returns on the NAND side of the business, and the team is very focused on making that a reality. And to the extent there is a partnership out there that's going to increase the likelihood and/or accelerate the pace, we're going to evaluate those partnerships along the way so it can be enhancing to the returns of what we do in the memory space. Yes. I mean first, as we think about the key technologies that we believe are going to be increasingly important going forward, I flagged them earlier, but we characterize them as our -- kind of our 6 pillars of technology differentiation. Obviously, process technology is an important component; Second, architectures, I'll come back to that; third, memory; fourth, interconnect; fifth, security; and sixth, software. And how we bring the collection of those 6 things together that nobody else in the industry can do, we think is really what's going to allow us to capitalize on an increasingly data-centric world. When we think about architecture, we just -- as we learn more and more about how workloads are evolving and the increasingly importance of artificial intelligence and parallel processing, we believe that architectures beyond the CPU, like GPU, like FPGA, like AI, like other accelerators, become increasingly important. So we have decided that we are going to invest in discrete GPUs. We're going to launch a new integrated GPU in the near term, which we're pretty excited about. But discrete GPUs, I think we said that we are going to launch it in 2020 time frame, both for clients and for data center. Increased workloads, we're going to leverage the integrated technology that we've enhanced and invested in discrete GPUs because we think it's an architecture that's increasingly important. And we think we can develop some real attractive products based on our existing core architecture. Bob, I had a question on 10-nanometer progress and the competition on the server side. I know your -- the team is sounding more confident about 10-nanometer on the client side. I'm curious what the progress is on 10-nanometer and the server side, and as part of that, how do you think your customers are reacting to a competitor bringing out their products in the back half? Your products are coming out next year. What are you hearing from customers as to how they are thinking about the next generation of server CPUs and the desire for perhaps diversifying suppliers? First, on 10-nanometer for server, what we've indicated is that we would have client systems on shelf for the holiday season, and our expectation is that server CPUs would be a fast follow. Historically, I think it's been more of a 12- to 18-month gap between client and then server. On 10-nanometer, that gap would be much shorter. And again, what we said is fast follow after client systems on shelf, so sometime in 2020, earlier versus later. In terms of just competitive positioning, with the -- we've been -- our Xeon Scalable product that we launched last year and then enhanced with our Cascade Lake launch just a few weeks ago I think, that has increased performance. It's got AI acceleration built into it. It's coupled with Optane memory. It's got a 56 core count. And the performance of that product, coupled with our knowledge of the environment in which -- our customers' environments, we think we really have demonstrated differentiated performance, a product leadership performance, even though it is still on 14-nanometer. So we have a good product that really pulls together those 6 pillars that I talked about earlier. We launched it a few weeks ago. We said we expect it to ramp as fast as any launch that we've done in the past. And we think it positions us competitively in the second half of the year, despite increased competition prior to launching 10-nanometer in 2020. So we feel good about 10-nanometer in general. We're going to be a fast follow with server in 2020. In the meantime, the Cascade Lake product has some real performance enhancements based on our deep domain knowledge of our customers. And it'll be an increased competitive environment, but we feel pretty good and we tried the best we could to capture that in our outlook for 2019. Yes. I think, first, yes, we feel like we got a great product lineup for the launch of 5G. We have a strong position today, and we think 5G is only going to accelerate that across a broad swath of our products and technologies. The -- a couple of things going on, we believe, in Q1. One, just in terms of the increased demand, we do expect it to be coming maybe a little bit later in the year. I think FPGA is a little bit earlier, but the Xeon, we expect to follow later in the year and even more in 2020, to be honest with you. So timing, we expect it to be out a little bit, modest improvement in the second half but not dramatic. And the other thing I would say is that we have a strong customer base in China in comms. And we -- like we saw in cloud and enterprise and government, comms growth we think was also impacted by strong comms growth last year that's probably being digested a little bit in the first couple of quarters of this year. Again, one of our large customers in China is a contributor to the question earlier about buying ahead and then digestion, is a weight on comms growth in the first quarter. So we're pretty excited about the demand signals we're seeing, the relationships we've built for 5G and think it's going to be a really important part of our story going forward. Yes, I mean I think the things we flagged, obviously, unit volume declines on a high-margin business worked against us. Secondly, it's really DCG now. I talked to you about the fast follow of DCG on 10-nanometer after client launch. So as a result, they're just now beginning to bear some of the brunt of the cost of sales that all went through the P&L in the first quarter until those products qualify. And then third, this is a -- this is a big growth area for us and we're going to continue to make investments. So those 3 things are really what drove the op margin decline in the quarter. As you know, just from historical trends, data center margins tend to be a little bit lower in the first quarter. And obviously, implied in our guide first half to second half, second half is a little stronger. And with that strength on unit volumes despite maybe more intense ASP environment, we expect operating margins to kind of improve in line with revenue growth in the second half. Those trends are fairly consistent with how the quarterly dynamics of DCG operating margins go. They're just more exacerbated in Q1 with the 10-nanometer cost of sales starting to impact the business. Just one more on gross margin, if possible, and I know you don't want to comment on '20. But I'm just trying to understand the trajectory here, because it seems like your 10-nanometer has been delayed. You're ramping it now. It does seem like it's on a portion of the product line, not like the old days, where it would flip over all of client. So I'm just trying to understand, if you look at the impact you saw this year, why is it incorrect to think about that you should see a similar impact next year? Well, yes, I think you know that our expectations are as we begin to ramp high-volume manufacturing, that in conjunction with that, we expect to see improved yields and better [units-to-die] performance as we go throughout the course of the year and as we step on the pedal and ramping volumes. So the -- part of the answer is we expect to improve yields as we go forward. But that being said, any time we transition to a new node, the earlier stages tend to be -- have a little bit of a compression effect on gross margins until we get a little more maturity. And I don't want to get out ahead on 2020. We're more focused on '19 right now, but it's natural for the transition to a new node in early stages to have a bit of a downward pressure on gross margin. Thanks, Blayne. And thank you all for joining us today. Operator, please go ahead and wrap up the call.","Yes, as we think about the gross margin trajectory through the course of the year, I'm wondering if you could help us understand the delta between the impact of 10-nanometer ramping relative to kind of the impact that you're seeing. It seems like it's going to persist, related to NAND flash. I had a question on your enterprise business within DCG. I was a little bit surprised by the magnitude of the decline in Q1. Bob, in your view and based on what you know, what you hear from customers, how much of that decline is tied to true end demand versus inventory dynamics at your customers? And I ask that question because some of your customers may have pre-bought in fear of supply constraints. I wanted to know, of the mid-single-digit decline for data center, how much of that do you think is units versus pricing? I would have expected, with the new platform launch, we might have seen better. And obviously, you have the inventory in digestion, but there's also competition that's coming in the second half. So how do you see units versus pricing declining within the envelope of your down mid-single digits for the business overall? I guess a question on the modem side of things. As you think about the cost savings as you deemphasize that business, will that be repurposed? Or should that accrue to the bottom line? And can you give some thoughts as to what the cost savings will have -- look like and what time frame we should see it? I know you would like us to focus a little bit more on op margin than gross margin, but I just want to go back to the gross margin line. As far as I can remember, with an in line revenue quarter for March, this is the most significant gross margin miss to Street estimates that I can remember for the company. And I know you've talked about 10-nanometer volumes being higher than you expected this year. Can you talk a little bit about the yield curve and kind of the cost of 10-nanometer? And I guess really importantly, if the long-term sort of upper range of your gross margin had been 60% to 65%, do you still think that that's the right sort of higher-end range as we go to the 10-nanometer node for CPUs, notwithstanding that some of the adjacencies are lower gross margin? Bob, I wanted to ask you just a question strategically about memory. And I wanted to understand, obviously, you need to make cost [point], but relative to NAND, why the need to make NAND on your own? It seems like you could sell the factory and maybe strike some sort of a supply agreement and save a lot of free cash flow, particularly after a quarter rotation can cost you 100 basis points. Bob, given your stance on concentration of resources, what are you thinking with regard to Intel developing a [term] GPU product? And if you are pressing ahead with this, can give us an update on where you are and when we might see the first Intel GPUs? 5G network connectivity is very strong and projected to continue to accelerate on a go-forward basis. Korea, China, U.S., all starting to fire. You guys have a great lineup of products, Xeon D, full-blown Xeon, base station ASICs, FPGAs and so on. So help us understand, given all these dynamics, why did the comms service provider segment decline year-over-year in Q1? And maybe more importantly, just given the strong 5G lineup that you have, do you see comms service provider contributing to the strong second half implied growth in your data-centric segment guidance for the full year? Bob, I just wanted to -- I was wondering if you could shed more light on the DCG op margin. We've not seen this low a number in quite a few quarters, I think 6 to 8 quarters, 38%. And you list 3 reasons, but it disproportionately seems to be lower versus the revenue decline. Could you shed a little bit more light? And more importantly, how should we expect this to trend as the year progresses?

INTC,Q4 2018,3498,2543,1934,"Thank you, operator. And welcome, everyone, to Intel's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by Bob Swan, Intel's Chief Financial Officer and interim CEO; Murthy Renduchintala, Group President of the Technology, Systems Architecture & Client Group and Chief Engineering Officer; as well as Navin Shenoy, Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Data Center Group. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from Bob followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Mark. And thanks to Navin and Murthy who will participate in the Q&A later in the call. Before I get into the results, I'll take a minute to address what I expect is a top of mind question: the status of Intel's CEO search. The board continues to evaluate candidates for what I believe is the biggest and best open job on the planet. They are proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company. Meanwhile, Murthy, Navin, the entire management team and 107,000 employees have come together as a team to continue driving Intel's transformation to a data-centric company. Our 2018 results demonstrate the progress we made, and I'd like to share those results with you now. 2018 marked Intel's golden anniversary. It was a truly remarkable year for a remarkable company. Full year revenue grew 13% and crossed the $70 billion mark for the first time, setting an all-time revenue record for the third consecutive year. Our data center, Internet of Things, Programmable Solutions, memory, Mobileye and modem businesses each set all-time full year revenue records. 2018 was also a pivotal year in Intel's transformation to become a data-centric company, pursuing an expanded greater-than-$300 billion market opportunity. Intel's collection of data-centric businesses grew 20% in 2018 after adjusting for McAfee. The largest of our data-centric businesses, the Data Center Group, delivered record annual revenue of $23 billion, up 21% year-over-year on strong cloud demand and growing share with communication service provider customers. Our PC-centric business achieved 9% growth in 2018 as the PC market stabilized, and we gained share in modems. While 2018 was a record year, we expected a stronger finish. Fourth quarter revenue of $18.7 billion was up 9% but short of our expectations as a result of a dramatically weakening modem demand, lower overall growth in China, cloud service providers absorbing capacity and a weakening NAND pricing environment. While revenue fell short, we exceeded our EPS outlook by $0.06 or about 5%. We continued to deliver outstanding new products for our customers and previewed new innovations that position Intel to compete and win for years to come, and we also made significant progress in growth areas like AI, autonomous driving and 5G. I'll take a few minutes to give some specifics before we dive into the financial results. Over the course of the quarter and culminating at CES, we highlighted breakthrough innovations that will be central to our product leadership for years to come. We outlined our product design philosophy, which combines 6 pillars of innovation: process technology, architecture, memory, interconnect, security features and software to consistently and reliably deliver leadership products that solve our customers' most challenging problems. One example of this design philosophy in action is our unique Foveros 3D packaging technology. Foveros enables active stacking of logic chiplets for the first time in the industry's history and lets us mix and match process technologies and architectures to deliver breakthrough products. The first such product, Lakefield, is slated for production in 2019. Lakefield features a 10-nanometer hybrid CPU architecture combining a Sunny Cove CPU core, 4 low-power Atom CPU cores, Gen11 graphics and more in a dime-sized product that enables the smallest PC motherboard ever possible. Foveros gives us tremendous design flexibility and paves the way for a myriad of devices and systems combining high performance, high density and low-power silicon process technologies. In the data center, we began shipping the new Cascade Lake family of high-performance Xeon processors with DL Boost for accelerated AI performance, hardware-based security mitigations and the first implementation of Optane DC persistent memory. Many of our data-center OEMs and cloud customers are now offering early trials of Intel Optane DC persistent memory, which is enabling entirely new usage models and improved system performance. In client computing, we launched our new ninth gen Intel Core desktop product lineup for gaming and content creation, growth segments that demand Intel performance. We also previewed our upcoming 10-nanometer Ice Lake client CPUs, which will deliver unprecedented levels of integration, including DL Boost inference acceleration, WiFi 6, Thunderbolt 3 and Gen11 graphics, our first integrated GPU with a full teraflop of performance. Our 10-nanometer yields continue to improve, and Ice Lake remains on track to be in volume systems on retail shelves for the 2019 holiday selling season. In Q4, we also made important progress in AI, 5G and autonomous driving. For artificial intelligence, we saw accelerating adoption of OpenVINO, our open-source tool kit for neural network optimization and the rapid deployment of AI-based Computer Vision. In addition to the strong adoption of OpenVINO by the developer community, we also launched several new products during the year, including our third-generation Vision processing unit. Our partners created a catalog of AI-based Vision accelerator cards with our VPU and FPGA products. While digital video was once a vertical within the IoT business, AI-based machine vision is becoming a critical horizontal capability that cuts across all IoTG verticals. And our leadership portfolio, both hardware and software solutions, is removing the barriers to deployment and accelerating IoTG's growth. We also highlighted a new AI product on our road map, the Nervana Neural Network Processor for Inference, or NNPI, which is designed to accelerate inference workloads and achieve the highest performance per watt in the industry. We expect NNPI to be in production this year. 5G is another big opportunity for both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses. At CES, we unveiled the new 10-nanometer-based network system on chip, codenamed Snow Ridge, developed specifically for 5G wireless access and edge computing. Snow Ridge will bring Intel Architecture into wireless access base stations and allow more computing functions to be distributed out at the edge of the network. We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge in the second half of this year, which is also when we'll deliver our first 5G modem, the Intel XMM 8160 5G. In autonomous driving and ADAS, mobilized effort to lead this revolution continues to build momentum with 28 new design wins and 78 vehicle model launches in 2018. In the fourth quarter, we announced plans to commercialize mobility as a service in Israel with Volkswagen and Champion Motors, making Mobileye's breadth of products, technologies and services unmatched in the industry. Mobileye's products now span from open ADAS and AV compute platforms to turnkey vehicle retrofits to, ultimately, mobility as a service. And they are enabled by the industry's best vision algorithms and driving policy software, the groundbreaking RSS model for AV safety and REM real-time crowdsourced maps. At CES, we announced important progress for both RSS and REM. ITS, China's leading industry organization for transportation standards, approved a proposal to standardize RSS for the China market. We also completed the mapping of Japan's highway system, 25,000 kilometers of roads, using data harvested from a customer fleet of vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 in just 24 hours. This is a task that would have previously required thousands of hours of driving and scanning using specialized vehicles. This sort of breakthrough is possible only with Mobileye's combination of technology and massive market scale, and it positions Mobileye to monetize ADAS and AV technology long before Level 4 and 5 autonomy are deployed at scale. And REM will be monetized in areas beyond autonomous vehicles. We just announced a partnership with Ordnance Survey who use data collected via consumer vehicles outfitted with EyeQ4 to help utilities manage infrastructure. Looking back at 2018, it is abundantly clear that Intel's employees, the unstoppable engine driving our innovation, are more determined than at any point in our history to make Intel technology the foundation for the world's most important innovations and advances. Not only was it a record year from a financial perspective, we achieved major milestones in terms of our diversity and inclusion goals. We reached full representation in our U.S. workforce 2 years ahead of our plan. We also achieved gender pay equity across our global workforce. And to celebrate 50 years of Intel, more than 68,000 employees volunteered approximately 1.5 million hours in the communities where we operate. I'm proud of what Intel employees achieved in 2018, and I am equally proud on how they responded to challenges. With that, let's turn to the financial results. The fourth quarter closed a record 50th anniversary year with strong data-centric and PC-centric growth. Revenue for the quarter was $18.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 9%, and our PC-centric business was up 10%. Operating margin of 35% was approximately flat with strong mix and continued spending leverage, offset by 10-nanometer cost and growth in our adjacent businesses. Strong business performance, spending leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in non-GAAP net income of $5.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. EPS of $1.28 was up 18% year-over-year. For the full year of 2018, we generated $14.3 billion of free cash flow; returned $16.3 billion to shareholders, including $5.5 billion in dividends; repurchased 217 million shares; and increased our buyback authorization by $15 billion. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion short of our October expectations due largely to an increase in accounts receivable. To summarize, we had a strong quarter and fantastic year with full year revenue up 13% or nearly $6 billion higher than our original forecast in January. Earnings per share was up 32%, and free cash flow was up 38% over last year. We're expecting another record year in 2019. And as a result of our continued growth, we are raising the dividend 5%. Our leadership products continue to win share in our expanded TAM as both our data-centric and our PC-centric businesses continued to grow in the fourth quarter. Our data-centric businesses were up 9% for the quarter as customers choose our performance products to move, store and process more data faster from the cloud to the edge. And our PC-centric business was up 10% as we saw continued strength in the commercial and gaming PC segments and regained modem share. Moving to earnings. We generated solid EPS expansion in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year, and our operating income increased $580 million with operating margin approximately flat year-over-year in the quarter. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for higher-performance products in the data center and client businesses, leading to higher volumes and ASPs, continued spending leverage, a lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks. Our focus on operational efficiency continues to produce strong results with 2018 spending as a percentage of revenue at 28.6%, down over 7 points since 2015 and meeting our 30% commitment 2 full years ahead of our goal. R&D is up $1.4 billion over the same period as we continue to increase investment in areas that will drive growth in our expanded TAM such as product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Over the last 3 years, we've grown annual revenue by more than $15 billion while adding less than $250 million in spending, resulting in a more than 25% increase in revenue per employee. Now some Q4 performance highlights by segment. The Data Center Group delivered another greater-than-$6 billion revenue quarter and a growing storage and networking CPU TAM that is greater than 30 million units. Revenue of $6.1 billion was up 9% year-over-year but below our October expectations. Year-over-year growth decelerated as all 3 major verticals within DCG were impacted by weakness in China demand and as some CSPs moved to consume capacity put in place earlier in the year. Platform unit volume was up 9%, and ASPs were up 1%. Our Xeon ASP grew mid-single digits as customers continue to transition to Xeon Scalable and a richer mix of higher-performance products. We also saw ASP expansion in our SoC products and much higher SoC volume as we continued to have success in network transformation. The higher SoC volumes resulted in more modest blended platform ASP growth. Non-CPU adjacencies were down 2%, driven by several large onetime deals in the fourth quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in the fourth quarter '18. Cloud revenue grew 24% year-over-year, decelerating from Q3 '18. Enterprise and government revenue declined 5% year-over-year on a very challenging compare versus fourth quarter 2017 and weaker China demand. Comms service provider revenue grew 12% year-over-year on continued MSS gains as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks on Intel Architecture. Our other data-centric businesses, IoTG, NSG and PSG, achieved solid growth in Q4, together were up 9% year-over-year or 13% excluding the Wind River divestiture. Our Internet of Things business had revenue of $816 million, down 7% or up 4% excluding Wind River, with operating profit of $189 million, down 27% year-over-year due primarily to supply constraints. Mobileye revenue was $183 million, up 43% over last year as design wins and ADAS adoption continue to accelerate. Our memory business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, up 25% year-over-year due to strong data center growth and continued Optane adoption offset by a weaker NAND pricing environment. The shift of our data center and client SSDs to our 64-layer 3D NAND continues in both the data center and client businesses with volume mix greater than 75%. NSG was approximately breakeven for the year. As expected, Micron exercised its right to call Intel's interest in our joint venture IM Flash Technologies. This announcement does not change Intel's plans in the coming quarters, and the close of the call is at our discretion up to 1 year after the date of the call with a supply agreement that extends beyond the close. We have manufacturing options available and have been shipping a broad portfolio of Intel Optane technology products for more than a year. We will continue to expand our product line and lead the industry with this exciting new technology. PSG's revenues came in at $612 million, up 8% on strength in the data center and comms segments. We saw continued momentum in PSG's data center segment, up 50% over last year. In the Advanced products category, our 28-, 20- and 14-nanometer solutions grew an outstanding 70%. Operating profit was $162 million, up 4% year-over-year. Finally, the Client Computing Group delivered another outstanding quarter with revenue of $9.8 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Commercial and gaming demand continued to be strong. The notebook segment grew 8% year-over-year. The desktop segment grew 3% year-over-year. Supply remained constrained, particularly at the value end of our product range. We are working closely with our customers to align demand with available supply while we add capacity, and we expect supply-demand balance to improve by midyear. Client adjacencies grew 45% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased modem share gains. Though modem revenue fell significantly below our expectations as a result of weaker smartphone demand. Our operating profit grew $402 million year-over-year with operating margin up 1 point. While our PC volumes were down 2%, our leadership product performance and segmentation contributed to strong mix. The investments we have made in the business organically and through acquisition are delivering excellent cash flow generation. For 2018, we generated $29.4 billion in cash from operations. We invested $15.2 billion in capital expenditures and delivered $14.3 billion in free cash flow, up 38% year-on-year and closing the gap versus EPS by 4.5 points. During this period, we returned 114% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Buybacks totaled $10.7 billion, and dividends totaled $5.5 billion. In addition, settlements of our convertible debt reduced fully diluted shares by 40 million. To wrap up with our full year results, we ended 2018, our 50th anniversary year, with our third consecutive year of record results, revenue of $70.8 billion, up 13% year-on-year driven by 20% growth in our data-centric businesses and 9% growth in our PC-centric businesses. We started the year in January expecting to generate $65 billion in revenue, 30% operating margin and $3.55 in EPS. The growth that we and the industry have seen has been remarkable. We ended the year approximately $6 billion higher in revenue with operating margin of 35% and $4.58 in EPS. Operating income of $25 billion was up 25% on strong execution across the businesses and disciplined spending. In October, we provided a preview of our outlook for 2019. At the time, we described a combination of tailwinds and headwinds that were balanced. The tailwinds were an expanded and growing TAM, product momentum and business mix. The headwinds were tougher compares following an especially strong 2018 and increasingly competitive environment in global trade. Since that time, trade and macro concerns, especially in China, have intensified. Cloud service providers shifted from building capacity to absorbing capacity, and the NAND pricing environment has further deteriorated. Those incremental headwinds are impacting our revenue expectations and slightly reducing our operating margin percentage forecast. The remaining factors are roughly consistent with our October assessment. Now turning to our outlook for 2019. We expect 2019 to be another record year for us as the world's appetite for the analysis, transmission and storage of data continues to grow. We are forecasting revenue of approximately $71.5 billion, up 1% year-on-year, and operating margin of approximately 34%, down less than a point year-on-year. We expect a modest decrease in gross margin percentage driven by the 10-nanometer ramp and the growth of our adjacencies. This will be partially offset by increasing OpEx leverage as we continue to make thoughtful tradeoffs and invest in R&D that will accelerate our growth and profitability. We expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 13.5%, following several beneficial discrete events in 2018, and we expect EPS of $4.60. We expect gross capital expenditures of $15.5 billion with logic spending up and memory spending down. The increase in logic CapEx reflects our effort to meet our customers' needs and avoid constraining their growth, while our investment in memory is focused on the sit-up of our independent technology development facility in New Mexico. And finally, we expect free cash flow of $16 billion, an increase of approximately 12%. As we look to the first quarter of 2019, we are forecasting revenue of approximately $16 billion, flat year-on-year, excluding Wind River. We expect PC-centric revenue to be up low single digits on higher modem share and data-centric revenue to be down low single digits on broad weakness in data center and continued NAND pricing pressure. We expect operating margin of 29%, down 1 point year-over-year, with a decline in gross margin as a result of the 10-nanometer ramp and the growth of adjacencies, partially offset by increased spending leverage. We expect EPS of $0.87, flat year-on-year. We expect 2019 to be our fourth record year in a row. We feel great about where we are and where we're going. Five years ago, we set out to transform Intel from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Today, our strategy, products and people are delivering on that ambition with strong growth, record results and the largest TAM opportunity in the company's history. I have been inspired and humbled time and time again by our employees' commitment to this company, their colleagues and our customers. And we're just getting started. I am convinced the board will close on a new CEO in the near future, and I believe the management team, myself and 107,000 employees will rally behind him or her to take this company to a whole new level. In the meantime, we will not be distracted by the void. With that, let me turn it over back to Mark, and we'll get to your questions. Okay. Thank you, Bob. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please introduce our first questioner.","Yes. Thanks for your one question, John. I'll take a stab, and then Navin is here with me as well, I'm sure he has a few comments. First, I would say that since we look at just overall demand for the data center environment, the end user demand by consumers and by enterprises, the workloads that we're seeing, the continued growth in workloads, we are as excited about the future as we've ever been. So we feel pretty good about the medium and long-term trends. As you know, in 2018, our growth rate, particularly in the cloud, was up 45% through the first 9 months of the year. So what we saw in the fourth quarter was -- as I had mentioned, we saw a little bit of consumption going on. As you know, the purchases are done in -- kind of in cycles, massive purchases through the first 9 months. And we started to see some of those purchases consumed in the fourth quarter. And we end the year, we think, with inventory levels on the server side of the business just a little bit higher than they had been historically. So as we project forward in the first 6 months of the year, we think that it's going to continue to be both consumption on the server side and pricing in the NSG environment to be down through the first 6 months. And consistent with kind of historical patterns, we do expect the purchasing to start picking up again in the second half of the year. That's kind of how we see it. Long -- medium, long-term, we feel great, massive buying in the first 9 months. The buying slowed a bit in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue through the first 6 months. I think just -- I think the last part of your question, I think just competitively, then I'll tick it over to Navin, look, we're going into 2019 with every expectation to compete, to protect our share position across our entire business. So we're going to -- we're obviously investing in the capital required to ensure we don't constrain customers' growth. We're continuing to invest in R&D. And third, we're going to invest to protect our competitive position, both on the PC side and the data-centric side. So yes, we expect competition to be stronger as we go through '19, but we're going to -- our guidance incorporates the fact that we're going to fight to protect our position. Navin, any... Well, first, yes, 2018 was a great year, as we mentioned earlier, it grew during the course of the year. But a function, we believe, Stacy, is just the end demand for data. And we haven't seen that slow down at all. Again, on workloads, insights from our customer in the industry, workloads continue to grow. The demand for analytics for compute, for storage, for rapid retrieval, we think, only continues to grow. And we believe that we have a very good position as we go into the year, including the products that Navin referenced. So we go into the year, we think, setting expectations in line with how we expect things to play out. And I would say today, our outlook is a little more cautious than it was a few months ago. And we try to take into account both the macroeconomics, the geopolitical risk, the modest inventory build as we enter the year and the competitive environment. We've kind of taken those into account, reflected them the best we can as we go into the year, and we feel pretty good about how things stack up right now. And our expectation as we have in the past is to deliver on the commitments we make as we kick off the year. Yes. First, just to maybe start with as we see kind of free cash flow for the year, we expect to be up $2 billion year-on-year with gross capital relatively flat. And I think you said this, but just to repeat, $15.5 billion going to $15.5 billion. During the course of '19, our expectations are, of that mix, that we'll be more logic-oriented. And that's really driven by a couple of things: one, ensuring we have the capacity to meet the 14-nanometer demand for our customers; secondly, as we ramp 10-nanometer in 2019 and position for 10- in 2020, we'll invest additional capital there; and then third, obviously, our expectations are to continue to invest in next-node technology, in particular, 7-nanometer. So logic capital is going to be going up year-on-year. And as we indicated, memory capital will be coming down. We put the capacity in place in Dalian during the course of '17 and '18, and our expectations are in 2019 that we have sufficient capacity for demand. However, we are going to be investing in our own capabilities, our self-sufficiencies for Optane product. So we will use some capital on building out Optane capacity, but memory capital will be a bit lower, gross capital will be a bit lower during the course of the year. Yes. So first, gross margin. The qualitative context is we expect gross margin to come down modestly off of Q4 levels and a little bit more off full year '18 levels. And we do expect that that will be largely, although not completely, offset by spending as a percentage of revenue coming down again in 2019. I think just on the gross margin, the trends are going to be a little bit similar to what you've seen in the past, although we do expect a little bit less ASP -- gross margin improvement from ASP. We expect unit cost to be up a little bit, and that will be primarily as we ramp 10-nanometer. And then the mix dynamics of more memory and more modem will weigh on gross margin a bit. So year-on-year, we expect gross margins to come down a little bit. On spending, as you know, we kind of -- we exit this year with spending levels down in the -- 26% in the fourth quarter and a little under 29% for the full year. So we're way ahead of our -- the 3-year plans that we laid out a couple of years ago, and we feel pretty good about the progress we made on the spending. And we've done it without cutting R&D. During that time frame, R&D has grown. We've been investing in the right things. Those things are growing faster. As a result, spending has come down 700 points from 2015 levels. As we go into 2019, spending overall, we expect to come down. Some things we did during the course of the second half of '18, including the exit of -- we exited Wind River. We exited wearables. We exited some of our new technology, small little businesses. We exited those businesses in the second half of the year, and we did some restructuring in the second half of the year. So as we go into '18, all that benefit from a relatively low Q4 $4.9 billion run rate, we expect that spending for the full year will be down year-on-year. So you net all that together and we have a -- we've been really focused on growing the operating income dollars of the company. We're not -- we focus on, but we're not preoccupied, with where the gross margin's going to land. Our focus has been on how do we grow the operating income dollars of the company. And in a relatively small growth year, we see keeping operating margins at 34% to be in a relatively good place without cheating the investments we need to make to continue to progress into '19 and '20. Yes. The gross margin, Ross, isn't really any different. The puts and takes back then, as I indicated, were modest ASP growth. As we are going to fight to protect our market share position, we don't expect a lot of ASP growth. Again, 10-nanometer ramp, not really any different. I highlighted in the prepared remarks, we feel very good about kind of where we are in ramping 10-nanometer during the course of the year to get systems on the shelf for the holiday season, so no real change there. And modem and memory growth will be a little bit slower today versus where we were 90 days ago. So, on the operating margin -- or operating margin percent, that's a slight positive. The real only change from 90 days ago is just we're a little more cautious on our revenue outlook, and our spending hasn't really changed. So we got a slight -- not as much leverage that we expected back in October but still good spending leverage during the course of the year. So not really any different on the gross margin and spending dynamics that we thought 90 days ago except a little less leverage on the spending line. Within DCG, how should we think about the mix, cloud versus comms versus enterprise for Q1 and 2019? Yes. First, in the fourth quarter, just in terms of isolating how we prioritize our capacity, there were no shortages within the client business, prioritization of big core and, to a lesser extent, small core, lower value-oriented products. And so we did -- we do feel like we constrained a fairly healthy PC ecosystem in the fourth quarter. I think when the dust settles on PC TAM, our expectation is it was probably flat and our shipments were down 2%. That was a function of we delivered every product that we could right up through December 30 -- 31. So we did have some constraints on the ecosystem and on our customers during the course of the quarter. At the end of the year, Chris, I think inventory levels relative to the beginning of the year were a little bit higher, maybe a 1.5 weeks, 2 weeks higher as we entered the year. And our expectations for the year is the PC TAM is going to be relatively flat. And that, for us, is a good place to be. We're probably halfway through the PC refresh cycle. We feel things have been relatively flat during the year. Inventory levels in the channel is a little bit higher ending the year. For us, inventory levels were relatively low as you might imagine on CPU just because of the constraints we've been dealing with. Our expectation is, working with our customers, that we will be through the supply constraints as we exit the second quarter of the year. Again, we'll use the same prioritization of server, big core, small core. But we'll be a little bit short on some product mix and on small core until we get probably through to the second quarter. And that will constrain us a little bit on just overall growth in the first half of the year. Harlan, this is Murthy. I'll take that question. I can only add to what Bob said in his opening statements that we continue to make solid progress against our plan that we shared with you during the course of 2018. And as I said on the last call, I feel better about our traction today than I did 90 days ago. So that continues to bode well for our product launch ambitions, which Bob summarized as having systems on the shelf for holiday season in 2019, with a barrage of products across all of our businesses to follow shortly thereafter. And I would like to take the opportunity to just remind everybody that at CES and in the analyst meeting we had at the end of last year, we did show 10-nanometers across the entire portfolio of our product ranges. We talked about Ice Lake clients, which clearly was top of mind in the early discussions, but we also talked about Lakefield, Bob mentioned that as well. We also -- Navin talked about 10-nanometers for Ice Lake server. And we also talked about 10-nanometers moving into our networking and 5G program, which we believe is going to be a big growth sector. So the story is not just about 10-nanometer yields but 10-nanometer now being a key part of our entire product portfolio. And as I say, I think that, coupled with our focus on the pillars of technology that Bob talked about, in my mind, I think, puts our product portfolio looking forward in a pretty good position. So net-net, I think 10-nanometer is looking better now than at the last earnings call. It's broadly deployed across our portfolio. And that, in combination with the other technology gradients, that Bob talked about, we believe, sets us up for a pretty exciting product road map. Yes. First, a couple of things. When we look at -- I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, and Murthy touched on it. When we look at the technologies that we believe are going to be imperatives going forward in this increasingly data-centric world: process, CPU architecture, interconnect, software, memory is a key component. And all the advancements in CPUs will be constrained if you don't have differentiated technology in memory. So we think that the role memory plays going forward is increasingly important. In terms of the -- just the CFO lens of having a commodity in the portfolio, I'm not too excited about it. And that's why the investments we're making in memory are for, what we believe, differentiated technology, both in the manufacturing process capabilities of 3D NAND but also the differentiated technology for Optane and the role that it plays, both on the PC side but, most importantly, for us on the data-centric side. So we're not particularly excited about commodities. When we make these investments, it's really geared towards products and technologies that are increasingly important and those technologies that are differentiated from kind of the core memory space that help us, in conjunction with the CPU, solve customers' problems. All right. Let me -- maybe if I could just close out, Mark. Look, we think 2018 was a great year. Our -- strategically, what it is we're trying to do and the opportunities we see are as strong, if not stronger, today heading forward as they've ever been. We think '19 for us is going to be another record year. At the same time, we realize that first quarter is just going to be lower. And the practical reality is we got -- we think we have a reasonably good read on the level of inventory that's in the ecosystem. I'd say this particularly for we're getting better and better on the diagnostics around the DCG business. The Q4 to Q1 dynamics for DCG historically have been sequentially down 8% to 10%. And the practical reality is, as we see it now, is that could be double in the first quarter. But that has nothing to do with the strength of the business, the product line portfolio we have coming and our excitement about delivering a real strong 2019 as we go forward. So thank you very much for joining us, and I'm sure we'll talk to you soon. Operator, please go ahead and wrap up the call.","Just relative to the DC -- the data-centric guidance for the full year of up mid-single digits year-over-year in calendar year '19, you did a good job kind of explaining what's causing the weakness in Q1, DCG and the NAND pricing. But as you look throughout the year from a minus kind of low single digits to full year being mid-single-digit growth, you are kind of looking for an acceleration against what becomes harder year-over-year compares in the June and September time frame at least. I'm just kind of curious if you can help us frame how you think that that reacceleration occurs. How long of a pause are you seeing with the cloud customers? And importantly, how are you thinking about increased competition in '19 in the data-centric businesses, especially in the server business, as you think about mid-single-digit year-over-year growth? Maybe the only thing I'd add, John, is that from a product point of view, the dynamic to think about in 2019 is that, as Bob mentioned, we began shipping for production Cascade Lake, our next-generation Xeon. And really, that product is going to ramp -- start to ramp in the middle part of the year and into the second half of the year. The design momentum looks very strong. The product features look very compelling. The AI capability we have with DL Boost, the support for Optane persistent memory, the security, hardware mitigation fixes, so that the customer momentum around that product line looks very strong. But it really doesn't ramp until the middle to the second half of the year. So as Bob said, the first half, a little bit tougher but second half, with product momentum as well as what we're hearing from our customers, we expect to be better in the Data Center Group. To maybe generalize on that, if I just look through your guidance, you're basically guiding flat in Q1. And roughly flattish for the full year would suggest that overall, you're looking for a revenue trajectory in 2019 that's very similar to the trajectory you had in 2018, which was very, very strong sequentially, in many of the quarters. So I guess, what is the risk, just given everything that's going on that that may be too aggressive, especially as you had a number of drivers in 2018, both on the data center as well as on the client side, that aren't going to be repeating in 2019? Like how do we think about that? I was surprised, Bob, on your CapEx guidance and especially on the memory side. So my understanding is that last year, you spent about $3 billion there, with about half of that money actually coming from your clients, so not being actually Intel capital being deployed. So if you had $1.5 billion of Intel capital deployed in memory last year, if I look at your guide and seeing logic is slightly up, memory is going to be slightly down, so the actual Intel capital invested, deployed into memory this year is going to be up massively, maybe close to 2x. And that's in a year in which everybody in the value chain, everybody in the memory industry is actually pulling back on CapEx and limiting capacity addition. So I'd love to understand how you see that and how you position Intel this year in memory. I'm going to shift to the expense line. So maybe give us a little more color on OpEx and gross margin trends and how you're going to hit the operating margin target. Just wanted to follow up, Bob, you gave a lot of great detail there on the margin side, especially on the OpEx side. I wanted to go right back to the gross margin side, though. And somewhat simplistically perhaps, but you kept the gross margin guide basically the same as you did at the end of last quarter despite the headwinds to mix seemingly with your data centric commentary and data center being worse and your revenue being lower. So is there any more color you can give on the puts and takes that leads to just the modest decrease given those other variables that seem like they have increased as headwinds from when you last talked about gross margin in '19? Yes. Thanks, Vivek, Navin here. Look, we've been -- over the last 18 months, been working hard to diversify the end customer segment mix inside of DCG, and there's 3 large components: the enterprise and government segment, the cloud segment and the comms segment. Cloud and comms is about 2/3 of the business now, where it was about 1/3 several years ago. And so I don't see any major changes to the way things play out in terms of where the growth will come from as we look into 2019 and beyond. While the first half in the cloud will be a little bit tougher, we do expect that cloud continues to grow as they start to move and to build out again in the second half. In comms segment, we continue to gain share in that segment, a large TAM where we have relatively small share. And as we grow our network SoC portfolio and as the market moves to 5G, we expect to continue to gain share. And in the enterprise and government segment, while we've seen stabilization there over the last 4 or 5 quarters, we're not really counting on the enterprise and government segment for growth. We do expect that enterprises will continue to make strategic choices about what to deploy on-premise and what to deploy in the cloud. And in general, that business is not one that we count on for growth. So in general, you'll see us continue to push on comms and cloud to drive growth, particularly in the second half of the year. Just wanted to receive an update on some of the CPU shortages that you've been experiencing, how you're progressing on alleviating the shortages, what effect that may have had on the Q4 results given that, I guess, there was some supply tightness at least coming into the quarter. And then on that, with demand slowing a bit, is there any fear? Do you have any visibility about customers who may have attempted or succeeded in building some inventory amid those shortages? Just wanted to get an update on 10-nanometer manufacturability. I know last quarter, the team mentioned that 10-nanometer yields where tracking 14-nanometer yields at a similar point prior to production ramp. Is the team still seeing good improvements in 10-nanometer yields? Are you still tracking 14-nanometer yield ramps? And can you just give us an update on early 7-nanometer development and manufacturability? Bob, I just wanted to go back to the NSG and the profitability in what was a really booming year for memory. Obviously, price has started to come down back half of the year, but NSG was barely profitable. So just from a CFO perspective, what is your tolerance level for having a business, a segment that could go into a deep cyclical downturn and -- not could, it is heading into a deep cyclical downturn. So how do you think about having a commodity within the Intel umbrella and, again, the risk -- not risk tolerance, the tolerance for lack of profitability? Just your perspective on that, please. I'll just maybe add one thing, it's Navin. As an example of that, the Optane persistent memory combined with Cascade Lake, Xeon plus Optane, that is a platform play. Optane persistent memory works uniquely with Xeon. And as I think about and talk to customers about the massive amount of data growth we're seeing, the ability for us to uniquely tie those 2 assets together to solve customer problems is a differentiator for us and allows us to drive growth. And so to the extent we can exploit more of those kinds of opportunities, things get more exciting from a business unit GM point of view. Navin, I had a question for you, and sort of there seems to be a little bit of a different tone between what we hear from your cloud customers, the compute guys, you and the memory guys are seeing weakness, but the networking companies still sound fine. So is it just an inventory digestion of computer and servers? Or is there something structural happening there? Yes. I think, as Bob said, and I think we talked about a little bit, we had 3 quarters of really, really strong growth in 2018 in the cloud. And that was driven by a product cycle as well as a typical multiyear build-out pattern with Xeon Scalable. And if you look back at all the historical trends we've had in the cloud business, we've always said there's some lumpiness to the business. And there's periods where people build, and then there's periods where people consume. The signals we get from our customers is a period of build for compute is going to shift now to a period of consumption. And that started in the second half, in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue through the first half of the year. Secularly, over the long term, medium to long term, the cloud business is going to continue to grow. There's no doubt about that. Both the consumer cloud and the enterprise commercial cloud, we see both of those continuing to grow. And the appetite for compute, I think, is somewhat insatiable. Bob talked about compute cycle growth. Our 5-year forecast for compute cycle growth, or MIPS growth, is 50% CAGR over the next 5 years. I see nothing slowing that down over the next number of years. So that would be how I'd kind of answer that one, Tim.

INTC,Q2 2019,3811,3044,1068,"Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Mark. The second quarter was significantly stronger than we forecasted in April, and our results demonstrated our customers' preference for the performance of Intel XPUs as workloads grow, diversify and become increasingly complex. That need for performance manifested in strong mix in ASPs across the business. Our Q2 results are proof points for the megatrends that underpin our strategy. The world's insatiable appetite for data is driving demand for solutions to process, store and move it faster and better. Customers want to work with partners who can deliver performance and platforms to address their most important technology challenges. Our data-centric businesses overall performed roughly in line with our April expectations. Data center and IoTG customers chose our highest-performing products leading to strong mix in ASPs. While our cloud customers absorb capacity they put in place over the last year, we continue to expect cloud demand to improve in the second half. Enterprise and government spending remains weak, however, particularly in China. PC demand continued to improve, particularly in the commercial segment. We now expect the PC TAM to be up slightly for the full year. Strong demand for our highest-performing products and the productivity and TCO gains they deliver continues. Mix was stronger than we anticipated. While small core supply improved, we were not able to fully satisfy customer demand for these SKUs in the second quarter. Tariffs and trade uncertainties created anxiety across our customers supply chain and drove a pull-in of client CPU orders into the second quarter. We also halted shipments to certain customers in response to the U.S. government's revised entity list. After a thorough review, we were able to resume shipments of some products in compliance with regulations and the net impact on the second quarter was limited. While we hope and expect trade issues to be resolved, further tightening of export restrictions would come with revenue risk to our business. As a result, we enter the second half of the year a little more cautious than we were 90 days ago. We met with many of you in May at our investor meeting where we outlined 3 major thrusts of our game plan to transform our company and grow. First, we're pursuing the largest opportunity in our company's history, a nearly $300 billion TAM comprised not just of CPUs for PCs and servers but of XPUs and adjacent technologies for an incredibly wide range of workloads and devices. Second, we're strengthening our product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation. And third, we're evolving our culture and improving our execution so that we can play an even greater role in our customers' growth and success. I'll take a few minutes to share some of the progress we're making. I'll start with expanding our opportunity and expanding our TAM. Over the last few years, we have dramatically expanded our served market while the PC market was declining. Our served market now is more than 5x larger and growing faster, and we have reallocated spending to expand our capabilities in higher-growth areas. We are evolving Intel Inside from a CPU inside a PC to XPUs inside everything that processes, stores and moves data. Big bets in 5G, AI and autonomous systems are an important part of this transformation. In May, I outlined a disciplined framework for investing in and evaluating big bets as we expand into new markets. First, we'll invest where we have an opportunity to lead major technology inflections. Second, our investments should allow us to play a larger role in our customers' success. And finally, they must show a clear path to profitability and attractive returns. Network infrastructure, which is transforming as the industry transitions to 5G, is one of our most important areas of investment, and we are laser-focused on this opportunity. This business has grown at a 40% CAGR since 2014 from just over $1 billion in revenue to more than $4 billion last year. The network cloudification that comes with 5G expands our opportunity in the core network and at the edge as more data moves closer to where it is created. We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge, Intel's 10-nanometer system-on-chip technology for 5G base stations early next year. We've already announced that 2 large telecom equipment manufacturers have committed to this architecture, and we're on track to 40% share in this market segment by 2022. While the 5G network opportunity meets each of our investment criteria, the 5G smartphone opportunity does not. This is why we decided to exit the 5G smartphone modem business and conduct an analysis of our options for the remaining parts of that portfolio. Today, we announced the sale of the majority of our 5G smartphone modem business to Apple. This deal preserves Intel's access to critical IP we have developed. It enables us to focus on the more profitable 5G network opportunity where we are growing and winning share. Another growth market we're gaining share is the Internet of Things. We are using our architecture, accelerators and software assets combined with unmatched scale and partners to develop one of the industry's fastest-growing IoT portfolios. Taken together, the IoTG and Mobileye businesses grew at 22% over last year after adjusting for the sale of Wind River. More intelligence is moving to the edge and more industries want to harness the power of data to create business value, innovate and grow. Devices and systems are becoming more autonomous. This is a trend IoTG is shaping and capitalizing on. Our team's work is producing outstanding results. In the second quarter, we grew at roughly 3x the market rate and are positioned to significantly outgrow the market over time. Here again, we saw demand for performance and strength across all verticals we serve with computer vision being an especially critical workload. Mobileye is positioned to lead another huge opportunity, autonomous driving. This business has grown at more than 30% CAGR since we acquired them in 2017. Our market leadership continues to build momentum with 20 new design wins this year, representing 11 million lifetime units. Nissan's ProPILOT 2.0 and NIO's pilot vehicles have begun production featuring Mobileye-based L2+ system for hands-free assisted driving technology. I visited the Mobileye team in Israel last month and was treated to an autonomous ride through the streets of Jerusalem. The progress we are making in Level 4 and Level 5 autonomy is extraordinary. Our mobility as a service JV with VW for deploying a commercial robotaxi service in Tel Aviv by 2022 is on track. Global coverage of REM, or Road Experience Management, mobilized real-time crowdsourced mapping capability, is expanding rapidly. Several major auto OEMs, most recently Ford, are adopting this breakthrough data-centric capability. To understand the power of this data, consider this: 1.5 million kilometers is sent to the cloud daily from BMW production vehicles. With the data collected from just the last 4 weeks, Mobileye was able to automatically map 94% of the German autobahn and motorway network. And the commercial opportunity for REM extends beyond real-time maps for vehicles. Since announcing the agreement earlier this year, Mobileye and Ordnance Survey have jointly launched a service that delivers high-precision road network location data to companies across multiple sectors. Artificial intelligence is a $10 billion data center silicon opportunity by 2023. And today, it's fueling cloud customer demand for solutions that accelerate demand in AI workloads. This is evidenced by the fact that key cloud customers, most recently Baidu, are collaborating on our Nervana Neural Network Processor for Training or NNP-T. NNP-T will sample to customers later this year, expanding our already diverse AI portfolio which spans multiple architectures, including ASICs like NNPI, TPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. All unified by single programming model, One API. The second major element of our game plan is extending product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation. The future of computing will require a solution-oriented mindset building on 6 pillars of innovation. Over the last 50 years, Intel has delivered breakthrough after breakthrough in computing performance that has propelled technology and society forward. We are far from finished as our product and customer announcements over the last quarter demonstrate. Our Data Center Group just announced a very important strategic partnership with SAP to optimize Intel's platforms, including Xeon Scalable processors and Optane DC persistent memory for SAP's end-to-end enterprise software applications, including SAP S/4HANA. For over a decade, we have worked closely with SAP on developing differentiated breakthrough technologies that make organizations run more efficiently. The broadening of our strategic partnership with SAP will allow our mutual customers to accelerate their organization's digital transformation by deploying SAP business applications optimized for Intel-based infrastructure in the cloud, on-premises and in hybrid environments. Our ecosystem partners have already received Ice Lake server samples. We are making good progress on Ice Lake server and are now planning to start production wafers in the first half of 2020 with the volume ramp in the second half of the year. Both yield and defect density are ahead of schedule for our 10-nanometer data center products. Cascade Lake, which is ramping now, is on track to be one of our fastest ramping products ever, and we have a great solution for our customers in the first half of 2020 with Cooper Lake in the same platform as Ice Lake. We are working more deeply with our customers to understand their needs and become the partner that they rely on to innovate and grow their businesses. They challenge us. It's producing results, and it's making us better. For example, in the second quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Google to collaborate on Anthos, a new reference design based on the second-generation Xeon Scalable processor and an optimized Kubernetes software stack that will deliver increased workload portability to customers who want to take advantage of hybrid cloud environments. These deep customer engagements are frankly one of my favorite parts of the role. We are constantly thinking about how we can help our data center customers harness the potential of data by processing, storing and moving it more efficiently. An essential part of the equation is interconnect technology, which is why we recently announced our intention to acquire Barefoot Networks. Barefoot Networks is an emerging leader in Ethernet switch silicon software with the programmability and flexibility necessary to meet the performance needs of the hyperscale cloud. We closed the transaction this week, and we are excited to have the Barefoot team as part of the Intel family. Our client computing customers can look forward to exciting new Intel products this year. In the second quarter, we launched a special edition of the world's best gaming processor, the Core i9-9900KS. We also launched our new 10th Gen Core product family codenamed Ice Lake, which integrates WiFi 6, Gen11 graphics and AI acceleration. While we are delivering on the present, we are also creating the future. Intel Labs is researching completely new architectures like quantum and neuromorphic computing that promise incredible leaps in performance and power efficiency. Neuromorphic computing strives to emulate the neural structure and operation of the human brain, which could deliver big advancements in artificial intelligence by allowing computers to sense, learn and behave more naturally and efficiently. Just this month, we announced an 8 million neuron neuromorphic system comprising 64 Intel Loihi research chips that's now available to the broader research community. Finally, we are evolving our culture and improving execution because our customers are counting on us. Our process technology road map continues to improve, and we're making excellent progress on 10-nanometer. We began shipping Ice Lake client in the second quarter supporting systems on the shelf for the holiday selling season and expect to ship Agilex, our first 10-nanometer FPGA later this year. We now have 2 factories in full production on 10-nanometer. We are also on track to launch 7-nanometer in 2021. With a roughly 2x improvement in density over 10-nanometer, our 7-nanometer process, which will be comparable to competitors' 5-nanometer nodes, will put us on pace with the historical Moore's Law scaling. We're also making steady progress increasing CPU supply. Through our investments, focused execution and tighter customer collaboration, we expect our PC CPU supply will be up mid-single digits this year while we expect the PC TAM to grow slightly. We'll continue to work with our customers to meet their required product mix and ramp additional capacity to ensure we are not a constraint on their growth. A final point of pride in the second quarter that speaks to Intel's values is the release of our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which highlights the progress made over the last year toward our 2020 goals around environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, diversity and inclusion and social impact. We achieved a number of our 2020 goals ahead of schedule: energy conservation, nonhazardous waste recycling, workforce diversity and technology empowerment. Being responsible stewards of the communities in which we operate is central to our culture and it is helping us transform and deliver the results you expect of us. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished over the last quarter and look forward to sharing more proof points of our progress with you in the coming months. With that, I'll hand off to George, who will take you through the financial details. Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid Q2 with revenue coming in at $16.5 billion, down 3% year-on-year and higher by $900 million compared to our guide. Data-centric revenue was $7.7 billion, down 7%. And PC-centric revenue was $8.8 billion, up 1% year-on-year. Our Q2 operating margin was 31%, down 2 points as client ASP strength was more than offset by platform volume declines and continued NAND pricing degradation. Q2 earnings per share came in at $1.06, up 2% year-on-year and $0.17 over our guide for the quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $5.7 billion of free cash flow, returned $8.4 billion to shareholders, paid dividends of $2.8 billion and repurchased approximately 117 million shares. As mentioned last quarter, we anticipated a more challenging year in 2019 coming off a large build-out of capacity in 2018 by DCG customers as well as the pricing dynamics in memory, which is largely playing out as expected. In light of these factors, I'm pleased with our results and operating performance for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was up 2% year-over-year driven by strength in our platform ASPs, lower 10-nanometer startup costs, lower operating expenses as well as lower shares outstanding and a McAfee dividend. Offsetting factors were data-centric demand softness, continued NAND pricing pressure and PC supply constraints impacting our ability to fulfill low-end PC demand. Our non-GAAP tax rate came in at around 12%, in line with last year. Let's now turn to segment performance. Our Data Center Group ended the quarter with revenue at $5 billion, down 10% from the prior year and up 2% sequentially. This was slightly ahead of our expectations with platform ASPs up 2% year-on-year. Xeon ASPs were up double digits year-on-year on mix as our customers continue to select high-performance products. Against the tough year-over-year compare, platform units were down 12%. Cloud revenue was down 1% year-over-year as cloud service providers absorbed capacity after growing demand 40% in 2018. Enterprise and government revenue declined by 31% with particular weakness in China, while communication service providers revenue increased 3% year-over-year. We see comms service provider demand still in the early phase of a meaningful 5G-related build-out. Overall, our other data-centric businesses were down 1% year-over-year or up 2%, excluding Wind River, on strength in our Internet of Things businesses, partially offset by ASP weakness in our memory business. Our Internet of Things businesses, which include IoTG and Mobileye, continue to show growth and delivered record revenue up 22%, excluding Wind River. IoTG showed strength across all segments with revenue growth of 23% year-over-year, excluding Wind River, and operating income growth of 21% on strong demand for higher-performance products in the quarter. We believe a portion of the revenue outperformance in IoTG is from tariff-related pull-ins. Our Mobileye revenue and operating margin were up year-over-year 16% and 20%, respectively, on continued ADAS penetration. Our memory business revenue was down 13% as the industry supply surplus continued to feed a deteriorating NAND pricing environment. NSG operating income weakened by approximately $220 million year-over-year. PSG revenue declined 5% year-over-year as softness in cloud and enterprise demand more than offset growth in 5G wireless. Advanced products, which includes those manufactured on 28-nanometer through 14-nanometer process nodes, grew 15% year-on-year. PSG operating margin was down 49% year-over-year on lower revenue, product mix and 10-nanometer road map investments. The Client Computing Group demonstrated strong execution this quarter with revenue up 1% year-over-year on mix-driven ASP strength, strong demand in commercial PCs and modems and $200 million to $300 million in revenue from order pull-ins due to trade and tariff concerns. We believe the PC TAM grew slightly in Q2 led by our commercial PC demand. Our PC units were down 5% as our small core supply was constrained and we could not fulfill all of our customer demand. We have made significant progress against our supply challenges, and we expect supply and demand to return to balance in the second half. That said, demand has been stronger than expected and product mix will continue to be a challenge in the third quarter as our teams work to align available supply with demand. We saw strong ASPs in the quarter with notebook ASPs up 3% year-over-year and desktop ASPs up 5%. Operating margin for our client group was 42%, up 5 points year-on-year on strong revenue and mix and lower cost of sales post qualification of our 10-nanometer Ice Lake client product. For the first 2 quarters, we generated $12.5 billion in operating cash flow and we invested $6.9 billion in capital to ramp 10-nanometer capacity and for 7-nanometer product development. We also spent $5.6 billion to repurchase 117 million shares to date. Buyback was accelerated in the second quarter where our average purchase price was $46.78 per share. We have $11.7 billion remaining on our Board authorization. Now let's talk about the full year outlook. For the full year, the market dynamics reflected in our April guide remain largely in place although memory has continued to weaken relative to our expectations. Although we have seen a weaker first half in our data center business, we expect a better second half as demand from cloud and comms service providers improves and our second gen Xeon Scalable continues to ramp. We are increasing our revenue outlook for the full year by $500 million to $69.5 billion to reflect the outperformance in the second quarter somewhat offset by the effect of trade-related pull-ins and a weaker memory environment. We continue to expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be down low single digits for the full year. Our guidance for full year PC-centric business growth remains a low single-digit decline for the year, reflecting share loss in small core applications where we have been short supply longer than expected and demand has remained healthy. We expect to have additional small core supply in the second half, which should allow us to regain some of that lost share. Operating margin for the year is expected to be 32%, flat to our previous guide. Full year expectations for gross margin are unchanged at approximately 60%. We expect Q3 gross margins to be roughly in line with Q2 on strong flow-through of higher revenue offset by increased 10-nanometer cost as we ramp production. The cost increase in Q3 will be tempered as we will be selling through some of the previously reserved 10-nanometer in the quarter, and we see the benefit of a grant related to our NAND factory in China. We expect Q4 gross margin to be down 3 to 3.5 points sequentially as we continue to ramp 10-nanometer and will have sold through the previously reserved inventory and will also not see the benefit of the NAND grant. We are making great progress on 10-nanometer and expect to see continued yield improvement as we move into 2020 and work through the cost curve. Full year spending is expected to be down almost $1 billion year-on-year in line with our prior outlook adjusted for costs related to our acquisition of Barefoot Networks. We are now expecting 2019 savings from our modem exit to rise to approximately $400 million to $500 million from our earlier estimates of $200 million to $300 million. The increased savings are being offset by higher spending on 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer processes and product R&D. Earnings per share for the year is now expected to be $4.40, up $0.05 from our April guide, reflecting higher Q2 earnings offset somewhat by the impact of tariff pull-ins on the second half, weaker memory and a slightly higher full year tax rate. We now expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 and Q4 to be approximately 13%, up slightly from our April guide as we anticipate a higher mix of our pretax income in the second half in higher tax domains. Turning to Q3 outlook. We expect revenue of $18 billion, up 9% sequentially, which is within our normal seasonal range after adjusting for trade-related pull-ins in Q2. Our data-centric and PC-centric businesses will be down mid-single digits year-over-year in Q3 against very challenging compares. We expect Q3 operating margin of 35% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.24 on higher sequential revenue particularly in PC, data center and IoT. I will conclude here and turn the call back to Mark. All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go and introduce our first caller.","Chris, it's Bob. First, I would say that during the course of this year, as George mentioned in his prepared comments, we lost a little bit of share in the second quarter particularly in CSG at the lower end small core primarily due to supply constraints. And our expectation is that we'll begin to work our way back in the second half of the year given the capacity we put in place to have more supply and meet our customers' demands. But stepping back and just looking at the macro environment over the next several years and particularly in the second half of the year on the data center side, what we've indicated is it will be a much more competitive environment. Our intentions are with a -- not a 90% share position, but more like a 23% share position that we have significant prospects for growth across multiple aspects of our business. And our intentions are over the -- over that time frame to continue to grow our data-centric collection of businesses at or above market rates of growth. And that's consistent with what we said back in January. We reiterated it again at our May Investor Day and nothing's really changed from that standpoint. Ross, it's Bob. I'll comment and then George will pile on. First, on growth overall, we had -- cloud, I'd still put in the relatively soft category to the first half of the year as the cloud players continue to digest. And our expectations have been and still are that cloud will get a little bit stronger as we go into the second half. And as George mentioned, comms has been low single digits as our customers begin to build up for the transition to 5G, so we expect that growth to probably materialize more as we go into the latter part of this year, but I think more in 2020. Enterprise and government has been brutal through the first 6 months of the year. Q1 was really soft. Q2 was even softer. And while we don't like it, it's been pretty much in line with how we expected the first half and even the second half of the year to kind of play out. A couple of dynamics. You'll remember last year was really strong for enterprise and government. Growth was much stronger than we expected. Our belief at the time is that that was largely a function of increased digital transformation by CIOs, a favorable tax reform environment that gave them a little more capacity to spend. And we benefited from that tremendously last year. So the first half of this year, even the second half comps -- our comps are much tougher. And I would say our sense is that CIOs, broadly speaking, are a little more cautious as they go into the second half of the year. And then when you just take -- that's a broad-based comment. And then when you take China into account, China is even worse than that. So our thoughts through the first half of the year and even going into the second half of the year is the E&G environment won't get dramatically better. Cloud will get a little bit stronger and comms will get a little bit stronger in the context of our overall full year guide. Yes. I would just add that we -- again, we saw enterprise and government down 31% year-over-year. I would say maybe a little bit weaker than even we were forecasting, which is for a pretty weak performance in that group. But in general, I wouldn't add any more to what Bob said. I think -- Stacy, it's George. We did say that we think we'll bottom out at 57% in '21. We didn't guide specifically for '20 but implied it would be closer to the 60% range. And I would say, one of the things that's going to help us -- two things that are probably going to help us as we think about 2019 to 2020, one is we're going to see more of the benefit of moving up the yield curve in 10-nanometer, which is pretty painful now, and you're seeing that really in the fourth quarter gross margin. I would also say though, you're seeing a really pure impact of memory in the fourth quarter as well because they -- we have a grant in the third quarter. So you're going to see a sequential step down just because of the absence of the grant and it just tells you how much the impact on gross margin overall for the DC-centric group has been because of memory. I think memory, if we can start to see improvement on that in 2020 -- and there's some evidence of firming of the ASPs, but probably too early to call that. I think that could also be a factor. But you're also seeing growth in our adjacent businesses, which have attractive margins. They'll continue to grow into 2020. And like I said, I think largely it's going to be 10-nanometer yield curve benefits, maybe a little bit improving memory and then improving adjacent businesses should be a little more positive than what we're seeing purely in Q4. Well, one of the things that we talked about, Tim, was trying to pull in as much as possible both the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer road map because we think the economics of that is more than worth the investment. And really, the investments we're making now are all focused on executing to that. We're going to see more accretion from this deal coming in the following year when we would expect a significant increase in the reduction in sort of the run rate OpEx for the piece that's going out at the end of the year. So maybe $400 million to $500 million this year, but you can probably double that number for next year, which we think will help on the total spending. And the question is will we need to retain this higher level run rate that we're seeing today for acceleration fully into next year? I think there might be some opportunity there as well. But we're going to -- we're going to invest first in those things that we think drive yield improvement in 10 and product performance improvement in 10 and 7. I would say we're still roughly in that ballpark. We haven't really changed our view of the full year.  There may be a little bit that slipped into the first half relative to our original second half expectations on the pull-ins even though it's more of an impact on the PC side that we saw a little bit of that in DCG. So now we're looking to a strong second half for DCG. On inventory, they were up about 12% sequentially in terms of dollars. Now when I look at your second half sales, you're forecasting them to grow 13% to 14% half over half, so it kind of makes sense. But just inventory in terms of historical levels, it's still quite elevated given the macro conditions. So is this all 10-nanometer-related inventory? Just what's driving this? How do you see it trending in the second half? And will there be any impact on the gross margins from any utilization changes that might be needed? Sure. Great question. And we're watching inventory very closely ourselves. The big bounce this quarter, as you suspected, was really about 10-nanometer within finished goods coming onto the balance sheet. And so there is actually some gross margin benefit, which we began to see this quarter and we'll see a little bit next quarter previously reserved inventory then flowing into the marketplace, so some gross margin benefit from that, and you've seen that in the CCG margins. We -- yes, normally we'd be up going into the seasonally strong third and fourth quarters in this quarter. I would say overall that we think the adds this quarter, which are all related to 10-nanometer, make sense. I think we feel still that our inventory is higher than we would like in memory, and we will look to bring that down over time. It's a very tough market to bring it down in and then feel good about yourself. So we'll continue to watch that. But that's been part of the pressure on free cash flow has been some of these working capital, particularly inventory impacts. To George's point, while we're not big fans of growing inventory, we feel great about qualifying the Ice Lake product in the second quarter. And that qualification is the single biggest reason for the step function in inventory from Q1 to Q2. So we knew if we executed on our plans of the Ice Lake client qualification, we'd have a step-function in inventory and we feel good about getting that qualification done and behind us. The implications of that is the higher balance in Q2 versus Q1. Okay, John. That's a great 3-part question. There's nothing unusual going on in depreciation in the fourth quarter. As I said, most of the impact is really related to -- we'll have gotten through all of the previously reserved 10-nanometer products, so you're going to see more pressure on gross margin from the products that are coming into the marketplace while we're still at the low end of the yield curve on 10-nanometer, which is where we are today. In 2020, how I think about 2020, I think we -- as I said earlier, we think we'll see a benefit from moving up the yield curve on 10-nanometer. We're pleased with our process work that's going on there now. And also, we would expect that memory, which has been a significant drag on gross margin this year, will help us a little bit overall. So no real change. Probably the easiest thing would have been to just go back to say no real change in our outlook that we gave at Analyst Day in terms of the gross margin trajectory over the next few years. George, the only thing I would add on the depreciation while there's nothing kind of out of the norm, there are 2 fairly big dynamics that happen over the course of the next several months. One is over time, we have more and more of our 14-nanometer equipment that's fully depreciated. So as you know, that's been our engine for a while, and we'll have more and more fully depreciated assets that are at work. That's obviously favorable. On the flip side, we have -- we talked about ramping 2 fabs and we've had a lot of assets under construction on our balance sheet that weren't being depreciated. So in one sense, you have a drop off from the life of 14-nanometer equipment. At the same time, you're deploying some of the 10-nanometer equipment that we bought previously. So those 2 things underneath the cover at the macro level to George's point, there's not a dramatic change. But underneath the covers there's 2 fairly big dynamics in the makeup of our equipment base and what's fully depreciated versus what's being put into service. You talked about the reasons for being a little more conservative about the second half than you felt 90 days ago, but your second half guidance isn't materially different than it was 90 days ago. So I guess how are you thinking that relative to the forecast? And I guess when you talk about pull-ins, like what is that -- I'm surprised that there is pull-ins at the same that there's shortages. So maybe you can just describe what the behavior is that's pulling revenue into Q2. So again, for the second half, really for the full year, we're largely seeing the full year as we talked about it 90 days ago. What I think the biggest difference is just how strong you see demand has been and the pull-ins that came into the second quarter leading to a much stronger second quarter where we are passing obviously some of that through with the exception of the pull-ins to the full year. So I don't want to sound like we're going to -- we'll see the normal seasonal bounce and it will be a strong second half of the year for the company. And I think we're expecting a strong DCG improvement in the second half as they get through the capacity digestion. We think the PC is going to continue to be quite strong. So relative to our forecast, I guess I may be countering a little bit this idea of a weaker second half other than memory has been a little bit weaker than we had expected. ASPs are certainly down more, and so we're anticipating some pain from that. And then of course, some level of demand was pulled into the second quarter, but it's really reflective of a year that is playing out largely as we expected with some upside on PC TAM. Yes. And I think the only thing that I would add to that is relative to where we were in April looking out to the second half of the year, we still have the threat of tariffs going up for goods coming out of China and the implications of that. And there's still a little bit of -- a little lack of clarity about the implications of the entity lists and how quickly applications for licenses will be received and processed. So I think that the real -- we're kind of $900 million better in the quarter. You took the year up for $500 million. We attributed roughly $400 million to pull-ins. As we go into the second half, we're just at the -- there's still a little bit unknown about what -- how this China thing is going to play out. And that's a big important market for us, and that's probably what makes me a little more anxious. First, I'd start with, at the risk of repeating myself, a TAM of $300 billion, the largest TAM in the company's history with a pretty decent wind at our back in terms of this insatiable appetite for data and what it means for the products that we build and design. So we view ourselves as having a relatively low-share position with significant opportunity to grow. But at the same time, we know it's just -- we're not the only ones that have seen a data-centric world and it will be a more intensely competitive environment. And our expectations over time are to protect our market share position while continuing to invest in new prospects for growth. And that hasn't really changed. When you look at that by segment, we're going to be -- on the PC side, we've been protecting our position for the last couple of years. I'd say the competitive intensity on the PC side started probably in the first part of 2017. And during that time frame, we've tried to protect our position while moving end customers up to higher performance products that generate higher ASPs and with that have the capacity also to fight back and meet comps in targeted areas where we need to. So that's -- how we think about it is big opportunity to grow, large market, protect our position while expanding into new vectors. And that transforms all segments, and we're a little more protective about some segments versus others in those cases, particularly when we're in a supply-constrained environment. So not a whole lot has really changed on that other than we know it's going to be more competitive and we try to take that into account as we've thought about not only our second half outlook but our 3-year outlook. Again, so it was small in the second quarter. In fact, it was probably a net positive because of pull-in activities. So if you looked at what we were prohibited from shipping versus what was pulled in on things we're allowed to ship where people were concerned that perhaps restrictions would become greater, that was a net positive in the second quarter. We think that dynamic just remains in play in the second half of the year. How much of the demand concerns were met in the second quarter, we'll have to see how that plays out. But our forecast is based on kind of the current state of activity. And as Bob said, we're -- it doesn't mean that we're not concerned or cautious about what could happen if there's a change in policy between now and the end of the year. Thanks, David. And we'll hand the call back over to Bob to wrap things up. Thanks, Mark. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. I'd just kind of close where I started. We had a -- the quarter played out much stronger than we expected. Revenue better, gross margins better, spending in line, earnings greater. And therefore, from that confidence, we're raising our full year outlook and kind of feel good about our performance 6 months through the year. Secondly and just more importantly, we continue to really work the supply chain so we're never in a position to constrain our customers' growth. We've made good progress through the first half. But I think more as we go into the second half, we're just in a better position than we've been in a while. We still have work to do. We're still working with our customers, but we feel pretty good on the supply as we enter the second half. And then third, our progress on both 10-nanometer and our confidence in migrating from 10 to 7 continues to grow based on execution. So we kind of gave you a 3-year outlook. We consider this the second deposit of that 12 deposit 3-year outlook, and I'd say we feel pretty good about where we are. And we look forward to giving you another update 90 days from now about continued progress momentum on our multiyear journey. So thanks for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again in 90 days. Thanks, Bob, and thank you all for joining us today. Operator, can you please go ahead and wrap up the call?","Just a question on share expectations. I know in the Analyst Day, you expected the competitive environment to get a little more -- I guess a little more competitive, although it doesn't seem to happen in Q2. Maybe talk about how you expect your share to trend over the next 4 to 6 quarters in light of the competitor coming out with 7-nanometer and then you guys introducing 10-nanometer later on. Do you think you'll maybe lose share over the next 3 to 4 quarters and then gain it back? Or how should we think about things are going to play out? Okay. So a 2-part question on the Data Center Group. I guess first and foremost, could you just discuss a little bit about the differences between the subsegments? The cloud side was impressively strong in the quarter and it sounds like you think that's going to continue. But the enterprise and government side, I know you said that was China specific, but that was exceedingly weak. Any more color on what's going on on that enterprise side in the current quarter and probably of equal, if not greater importance, the second half looks like you still expect a really big ramp and potentially better than seasonal. What gives you the confidence in the second half ramp in DCG? So we have gross margins coming down into Q4, you're probably in the low to mid 58%s. And I know at the Analyst Day, you had sort of given an indication for gross margins in like the 2021 time frame to be around 57% on a $77 billion number. I guess how do we think about the trajectory from where we're exiting this year to the gross margin profile in 2021? Does that imply that 2020 gross margins should be down from obviously 2019 and 2021 should be down from 2020? And then what happens if you actually don't hit your revenue guidance of $77 billion in 2021 because the margin impact is mostly fixed? Does that imply margins come down even more in that case? I had a question for George. So George, I'm just trying to figure out the incremental accretion from the sale of the modem business. It doesn't seem like a lot of it is dropping through to the op margin because you're investing more in 7- and 10-nanometer. So I'm just wondering why that would be the case if yields are on track. Maybe just again to kind of step back on the data-centric businesses. On the revised full year outlook, you're still guiding data-centric to be down low single digits year-over-year. Previously, within data-centric, you guys were looking for DCG specifically to be down mid-single digits year-over-year, which implies about 20% growth in DCG second half versus first half. Is that still how the team sees DCG for the full year? Congratulations on the solid results. Maybe if I can go back to the gross margin from -- at the Q4 level, I'm just kind of curious, given that CapEx has been running significantly ahead of depreciation, I'm kind of curious if there's anything going on on the depreciation schedule, which is impacting the calendar fourth quarter gross margins. And George, to the extent that in the previous question you talked about maybe some tailwinds relative to the fourth quarter run rate next year in 2020, how do we think about the bridge from sort of the Q4 guide of kind of 58.5 to the Analyst Day guide for 2021 of 57, is that all just the impact of 7-nanometer coming on in that year? Or is there some price consideration? How should we conceptually think about that? George and maybe Bob as well, we had heard and continue to hear rumblings of -- and you guys have addressed it at the Analyst Day and in other forums about how you might be price aggressive in certain sectors to try to protect market share. And I wonder if you might comment about how you're thinking about that strategically in your notebook business where you have 10-nanometer product coming online versus in your desktop business where you might be on 14-nanometer for a bit longer. Just a clarification of what you had said with regard to restrictions in shipments to various entities in China. Did you say that the net result was actually small in the second quarter? And will there be -- do you expect any meaningful impact on DCG revenues from restrictions and shipments in the third quarter? Or is that going to be small, too?

INTC,Q3 2019,2952,3342,1192,"Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's third quarter earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that, this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Trey. Q3 2019 was the best quarter in our company's history. We generated $19.2 billion in revenue and $1.42 in non-GAAP EPS, exceeding our guidance by $1.2 billion and $0.18, respectively. We achieved record revenue both overall and in our data-centric businesses while making continued progress on our strategic priorities. Simply put, our ambitions have never been greater. We are growing share in a large and expanding $300 billion market opportunity fueled by the exponential growth of data, which is reshaping computing. I want to start with a recap of our May Analyst Day and our 3 priorities: Accelerating growth, improving execution and deploying capital for attractive returns. First, growth. It starts with a core belief. We are at a key inflection point with the exponential growth of data creating massive demand for semiconductors. Cloud workloads are diversifying. Networks are transforming. And more computing performance is moving to the edge. We've been on a multiyear journey to reposition the company's portfolio to take advantage of this industry catalyst. Today, we have the product and technology leadership that uniquely positions us to capitalize on these trends and will invest in the IP required to help our customers win the inflections of the future. The opportunity is massive. As we told you in May, we expect to generate $85 billion in revenue and $6 in EPS in 3 to 4 years. But that doesn't happen just by saying it. Achieving this goal means delivering on our operational and financial priorities every 90 days. Growth starts with our Core business where our workload-optimized platforms are winning in a highly competitive marketplace. It's now been 9 quarters since the first Xeon Scalable processor launched, and we're proud to have delivered over 23 million units as customers rely on Xeon to power their data-centric workloads. In the third quarter, leading cloud customers ramped our second-generation Xeon Scalable processors with AWS, Google and Alibaba deploying instances based on Cascade Lake. Customers including BP and TU Darmstadt selected our highest-performance Xeon Scalable platform, the 9200 series, for their most demanding workloads. One key reason customers are choosing Xeon Scalable is the platform's built-in workload acceleration for AI. With the combination of Intel Deep Learning Boost and AVX-512 technologies, we're seeing advantages of up to 9x in AI inference versus competitor CPUs. We also see cloud and enterprise momentum building for our break-through memory technology, Intel Optane. This quarter, we announced a strategic collaboration with Oracle. Oracle is incorporating the high-performance capabilities of Intel Optane DC persistent memory into its next-generation Exadata platform, which powers high-performance database infrastructure at most of the world's leading banks, telecoms and retailers. And in client computing, we're excited that all our major PC OEM customers have Ice Lake designs, with 18 already shipping out of a total of 30 expected to launch this year. We recently announced the next generation of Intel Xeon W and X-series processors for high-end desktops. These platforms lead the industry in bringing Intel Deep Learning Boost-powered AI acceleration into high-end PCs and mainstream workstations for the first time. Available soon, these products deliver performance and value that give enthusiasts and creators more reasons to keep choosing Intel. We've also embarked on a multiyear program, called Project Athena, that charts a course for the PC ecosystem to raise the bar on laptop innovation. Amazing devices like the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 and the HP Elite Dragonfly that meet the Project Athena spec are already available. Our PC and server franchises are vital, but our ambitions are even greater. We're extending our product leadership to power an increasingly 5G- and AI-enabled world. We have multibillion-dollar networking and IoT/Edge businesses delivering double-digit growth, and AI is driving significant revenue across our product portfolio. We began investing 10 years ago in network IP, SoC capabilities and software so that we could drive workload convergence on Intel's silicon. Today, we achieved #1 share in the network and silicon market with expected 2019 revenue of more than $5 billion, growing at 12% this year. We're also well-positioned for 5G deployments in 2020 and expect to grow our market segment share in wireless base stations to 40% by 2022. And we're ready for the next market inflection as 5G enables significant new IoT and Edge growth opportunities that extend from in-network and on-premise Edge equipment to smart connected endpoints. Winning here means blending the right compute performance per watt with the emerging killer apps of the Edge, Computer Vision and AI inference acceleration. These are the differentiating capabilities that have propelled our IOTG and Mobileye businesses to leadership share and the combined annual revenues approaching $5 billion. The businesses are also growing quickly, up 18% year-to-date, excluding Wind River. We're only at the bend of the curve in the Edge opportunity, and we're investing to lead. Finally, artificial intelligence. AI is becoming a pervasive use case. According to IDC, 75% of enterprise applications will use AI by 2021, and that's why we're infusing AI in everything we build. But this isn't just about the future. We are driving meaningful AI revenue inside Intel now. With products spanning from the data center to the edge, we expect to generate more than $3.5 billion in AI-driven data-centric revenue in 2019, up more than 20% year-over-year. We're confident in our growth, but we also need to improve our execution on multiple fronts. First, supply. We've increased our output in response to stronger-than-expected demand. We've invested record levels of CapEx the last 2 years to expand our capacity and support our customers' growth. With that investment, we've increased our 14-nanometer capacity 25% this year while also ramping 10-nanometer production. We expect our second half PC Client supply will be up double digits compared to the first half, and we expect to further increase our PC Client supply by mid- to high single digits in 2020. But that growth hasn't been sufficient. We're letting our customers down, and they're expecting more from us. PC demand has exceeded our expectations and surpassed third-party forecasts. We now think the market is stronger than we forecasted back in Q2, which has made building inventory buffers difficult. We are working hard to regain supply/demand balance, but we expect to continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter. Our manufacturing process node execution is also improving. We have fabs in Oregon and Israel in volume production on 10-nanometer and will soon start 10-nanometer production in Arizona. Yields are improving ahead of expectations for both client and data center products. The Intel 10-nanometer product era has begun, and our new 10th Gen Core Ice Lake processors are leading the way. In Q3, we also shipped our first 10-nanometer Agilex FPGAs. And in 2020, we'll continue to expand our 10-nanometer portfolio with exciting new products, including an AI inference accelerator, 5G base station SoC, Xeon CPUs for server storage and network, and a discrete GPU. This quarter, we've achieved power-on exits for our first discrete GPU, DG1, an important milestone. As we discussed at the May investor meeting, we are accelerating the pace of process node introductions and moving back to a 2- to 2.5-year cadence. Our process technology and design engineering teams are working closely to ease process design complexity and balance schedule, performance, power and cost. We are on track to launch our first 7-nanometer-based product, a data center-focused discrete GPU, in 2021, 2 years after the launch of 10-nanometer. We are also well down the engineering path on 5-nanometer. Last, a few thoughts on our capital deployment priorities. We are confident in our future, and our Board has approved an additional $20 billion share buyback authorization. We have an excellent balance sheet, generate strong free cash flow and continue to invest in R&D and CapEx to grow. We've also returned 100% free cash flow to shareholders over the last 10 years. At the same time, we're making tradeoffs. While we've increased R&D spending by more than $1 billion since 2015, we have reduced our total spending by 9 points over the same period. Additionally, we have established clear criteria for our big bets like Mobileye, 5G, and memory and storage. Our ambitions are to play a larger role in our customers' success and generate attractive returns for our shareholders. And if we can't do both, we'll take swift action. We are making great progress with our Mobileye acquisition. We've now shipped over 12 million EyeQ devices this year, up more than 40% over the same period last year. And in the third quarter, we delivered record revenue and secured 6 major new design wins, totaling nearly 10 million lifetime units. We've increased our investment in 5G, but we've also announced our 5G smartphone modem exit and the sale of the IMFT fab to Micron. We expect those to close in the fourth quarter. And we continue to take steps to improve 3D NAND profitability and reduce memory CapEx investments while evaluating a variety of partnership options that can accelerate the path to profitability and improve returns. We are confident in our multiyear business plan. And consistent with that, we are increasing our buyback commitment. We expect to repurchase approximately 20 billion shares over the next 15 to 18 months. We'll fund the buyback from proceeds we generate from partnerships and/or noncore asset dispositions and by returning approximately 100% of 2020 free cash flow to investors. In summary, our energies are focused on accelerating our growth, improving our execution and allocating our capital wisely. Thanks to the team for a great quarter. And now I'll hand the call over to George for more details on our Q3 results and business outlook. Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We had an outstanding Q3 with record revenue of $19.2 billion, approximately flat year-on-year and $1.2 billion higher than guide. We saw record data-centric revenue of $9.5 billion, representing just under 50% of our total revenue, an all-time high. DCG, IOTG, NSG and Mobileye all individually achieved record revenue in the quarter. PC-centric revenue was down 5% year-on-year on a very tough compare. Q3 operating margin was approximately 36%, 1 point ahead of our guide on revenue strength and spending leverage. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.4%, modestly below expectations as strong flow-through of higher DCG revenue was more than offset by mix effects of higher-than-expected NAND revenues and onetime impacts in NSG, including the absence of an expected grant associated with our NAND factory. Q3 EPS was $1.42, $0.18 above our guide. The results demonstrate strong top line performance, expense discipline, increased share buybacks as well as nonoperational factors like lower tax rate offset by the onetime items in our NSG business. Year-to-date, we have generated $11.7 billion of free cash flow and returned $14.3 billion to shareholders. Operating margin of 36% in quarter was down approximately 4 points versus last year as ASP strength in our server and client businesses and lower spending were more than offset by NAND pricing degradation, changes in modem reserves, platform volume declines and higher cost as we ramp our 10-nanometer client products. EPS was up 1% or $0.02 year-over-year as lower operating margin was offset by lower share count, the absence of onetime impairments related to the IMFT joint venture and a lower tax rate. Our non-GAAP tax rate in Q3 was approximately 11%, down 1 point versus last year and below our 13% guide as we reported a better-than-expected tax benefit related to our non-U.S. sales on our recently filed 2018 U.S. tax return as well as for the 2019 tax year. Let's move to segment performance. Our Data Center Group had record revenue at $6.4 billion, up 4% from the prior year and up 28% sequentially. These results beat our expectations with platform ASPs up 9% year-over-year on strong adoption of our highest performance 2nd Gen Xeon Scalable products. Against a tough year-over-year compare, platform units were down 6% while DCG adjacencies achieved 12% revenue growth driven by our connectivity solutions. DCG growth segments, cloud and comms, now represent over 2/3 of total DCG revenue. Cloud revenue was up 3% year-over-year, returning to growth after a historic 2018 platform refresh as cloud service providers exited a 3-quarter capacity absorption cycle. Enterprise and government revenue came in ahead of expectations, growing 1% on strong mix and better China demand, while communication service providers revenue increased 11% on continued adoption and share gains of IA-based solutions. We estimate in Q3 that the enterprise and government and communication service provider segments benefited from trade-related demand pull-ins of approximately $200 million in revenue from Q4. As a result of the strong top line performance, DCG achieved record quarterly operating income, and operating margin of 49% was up 13 points sequentially. Our other data-centric businesses were up 13% year-over-year, and Q3 marked IOTG's first $1 billion revenue quarter, up 9% year-over-year, underscoring Intel's expanding opportunity at the Edge. IOTG operating income was down 4% year-over-year due to lower benefits from inventory reserves and a mix shift to lower-margin products. Mobileye revenue and operating income were up year-over-year, 20% and 29%, respectively, on continued ADAS penetration and new program launches. NSG revenue returned to growth, up 19% on continued bit growth, partially offset by year-over-year pricing declines. These pricing declines, along with the onetime impacts discussed earlier, contributed to NSG's operating loss of approximately $500 million. PSG revenue grew 2% year-over-year on continued strength in wireless, partially offset by softness in cloud and enterprise, and operating income was down 13% on segment product mix. CCG revenue was $9.7 billion, down 5% year-over-year, as ASP strength partially offset lower platform volume. PC unit volumes were down 10% versus Q3 '18 where we benefited from drawing down internal inventory to satisfy demand. We continue to be supply-constrained in Q3, particularly at the value end of the market as higher-than-expected PC demand strength continues to outpace our supply despite the capacity additions that Bob discussed earlier. Adjacencies grew 10% year-over-year driven by strong demand for modems and connectivity solutions. Operating margin was 44%, flat year-on-year, as lower revenue was offset by lower spending driven by the 5G smartphone modem exit. Year-to-date, we have generated $23.3 billion dollars in operating cash flow and invested $11.5 billion in CapEx. We also returned 122% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During the quarter, we ramped buybacks, purchasing 92 million shares at an average price of $48.78 per share. Now moving to the full year outlook. As a result of our strong Q3 operating performance and momentum into Q4, we are increasing our revenue outlook for 2019 by $1.5 billion to $71 billion. We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be flat to slightly up for the full year and expect our PC-centric business to be flat to slightly down, both improving versus prior guidance. Operating margin for the year is expected to be approximately 32.5%, up 0.5 points from our prior guide. Full year expectations for gross margin are unchanged at approximately 60%. We expect Q4 gross margin to be down 2 to 2.5 points sequentially as we continue to ramp 10-nanometer and will have sold through the previously reserved inventory, consistent with prior expectations. Expectations for full year spending are unchanged, down approximately $900 million year-on-year. As a result, non-GAAP EPS for the year is now expected to be $4.60, up $0.20 from our July guide on strong top line performance and tight expense control. We are raising gross CapEx by $0.5 billion to $16 billion as a result of increased 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer investment. And we are raising our free cash flow guide by $1 billion to $16 billion. Let's turn to Q4. After adjusting for the impact of trade-related pull-ins in DCG, we expect Q4 revenue of $19.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our data-centric businesses are expected to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year on continued cloud recovery and sequential NAND pricing growth. Our PC-centric business is expected to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. We expect Q4 operating margin of approximately 33.5% and a tax rate of 13.5%. EPS is expected to be $1.24, down sequentially on lower gross margin, lower below-the-line nonoperational benefits and a higher tax rate. In summary, we are very pleased with the company's strong operating performance, and we will be very focused over the quarter on delivering a record year. With that, let me turn it back over to Trey. All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.","Yes. Thanks, C.J. First, we gave a DC-centric guide of 6% to 8%. And yes, I would -- we didn't give DCG specifically, but I would say it's a little bit lower than our 6% to 8% data center growth, so you're in the ballpark. On comms service, the comms -- this has been an extremely important aspect of the business for a number of years now where we've seen the programmability at the networks with NFV and software-defined networks an opportunity for us to migrate the networking environment to IA architecture. So we've been doing this for a number of years. It's been a fulsome growth for us over time. And in the quarter, the 11% growth was significant in and of itself, but remember, last year's third quarter was also up in the mid- to high 20s. So we continue to make good -- great progress. What we see going forward in this business is really a big opportunity in 5G. So next year, you're going to see -- our good progress has been on 3G and 4G. Next year, we see real design wins that we've achieved, real growth as we go into that 5G world where we continue to see what we characterize as cloudification the network, more and more compute moving from the cloud and data centers out to a network and Edge. And that's been an opportunity for us that we've been investing in over the past, and we expect to be a big source of growth for us going forward. Oh, boy. Was that your one question, John? Yes. Okay. So first, I'd say in our -- obviously, we're well into Skylake, but the transition now is into Cascade Lake, and that's a higher performance SKU. In the quarter, the high ASPs were really driven by particularly cloud customers really moving to the highest end product within the Cascade Lake family. So we're seeing the transition from Skylake to Cascade Lake, and within Cascade Lake, real high-performance SKU that's our highest performance ASP. So that mix dynamic in Q3, I don't expect that to stay where it is. I think we'll go to more of a balance as we're into Q4 next year. In terms of competitive dynamics, I would just say that we got a great lineup of products. We got Skylake to Cascade Lake. First half to next year, we're looking at Cooper Lake. As we talked before, we're really excited about Ice Lake server coming out in the second half of next year. And we realize it will be a more competitive environment, and we've tried to capture that in essence in how we think about 2020 for both demand equation but also the margins that we've flagged a little bit on the -- on our Q2 call back at Analyst Day, I think. So good quarter, good momentum first half to second half; high performance SKUs driving real high ASPs even though, you're right, that the ASPs with comms have a tendency to be a little bit lower. I wonder if you could talk to the shortages a little bit more and, I guess, in the context of how much you said you brought 14-nanometer capacity up. And I realize demand is better, but it seems like it's a few points better, and yet the shortages are intensifying. Can you just talk a little bit about that? And when do you think we'll be in a position where you don't have those tensions in your business anymore? Yes. Thanks, Joe. First, just kind of try to put it in to context. Over the course of the last 3 years, I guess, we've grown the business by about 20%, so $13 billion in revenue over the last 3 years. And the practical reality is we didn't anticipate that kind of explosive growth 3 years ago. So we didn't have the capacity in place to deal with it. We've been working our tails off for the last 12 months to ensure for our customers that we wouldn't be a constraint on their growth. From the last 2 years, I think, as you know, we've spent over $30 billion in CapEx to both have more capacity for 14 while we also begin to ramp 10. In my prepared comments, I said we added 25% wafer start capacity 2018 to 2019. Our first half to second half unit volume will be up double digit, so we're making good progress throughout the course of the year, but our expectations were in the second half we will be back in a supply/demand equilibrium. And the fact of the matter is we're not there because the demand profile that's resulting in our $1.5 billion higher revenue is just higher than we had anticipated. So we have more work to do to meet our customers' demands in the fourth quarter and going into '20. As we see fourth quarter, we're still going to be constrained in our customers' growth, which is absolutely where we do not want to be, but with the higher demand, we will be constraining the growth in the fourth quarter. But as we go into 2020, our expectations are we'll add another 25% capacity both for 14 and 10 and that we will have -- particularly for PC Client, we expect to be able to do mid- to high single-digit unit volume growth next year. And that -- we don't expect the market to grow that fast, but we got to have just more inventory buffers so we're there when our customers need us. So Q4 will be a little challenging, and in 2020, we expect to be able to rectify things. Yes. It's a good question. Last -- back in our Analyst Day, we tried to go through this in quite a bit of detail, both, one, kind of our lessons learned coming out of the challenges we had with 10 and how we're capturing those lessons learned as we think about the next 2 generations. But first, our focus and energy is, right now, we're on scaling 10. And as we said, we feel very good about the capacity we put in place, the products we have coming down the pipeline and the yields that we're achieving, almost week-on-week improvement over the last 6 months. So for 10, we feel really good. Second, we -- when we put the design rules in for 7-nanometer, we were less aggressive in terms of density. Our learning from going from 14 to 10 is -- with the benefit of hindsight, we were just -- we tried to scale at a 2.7 factor, and that was -- that ended up putting too much indention or revolutionary nodes into the fab environment to meet those kind of hurdles. And the learning from that is we just can't hit those kind of really aggressive targets when, to your point, the dynamics are getting increasingly challenging, so lots of learnings out of 10. Our transition to 10 that we incorporated into 7, the design rules, there's less complexity. And for the last couple years, we've been working with EUV. Litho has been the challenge. We've had EUV that we've been working with for a few years now. And we expect to use EUV as we scale 7. And we indicated that our first product will be 2 years from this quarter, so fourth quarter of 2021, our first 7-nanometer product will come out. And our expectation is we'll get back on a 2-year cadence in 7 and beyond. So lots of learnings out of 10-nanometer that we've incorporated. And we said back in May and we reiterated today, we expect to be back to a 2- to 2.5-year cadence going forward, at least for the next few nodes. Both at the PC and the data center level. And I'll -- maybe I'll jump in on the PC because I think the year-over-year compare in Q3 is -- could be causing some concern. Just a reminder, in Q3 of last year, we had basically drawn down more than 1.5 weeks of inventory that -- which went into the channel. And so when you do compares year-over-year on Q3, PC looks a little bit light on demand. Really, as we look over the last 90 days, we haven't seen any difference in our view of the competitive dynamics. We are clearly being impacted significantly on the value end of the market, which is a supply issue for us. It's one of the reasons why we're building volume capacity -- continuing to build volume capacity into 2020 because we think it gives us an opportunity to compete for those units again next year. Bob, I don't know if you want to comment on the DCG side. Yes. I'll try because I'm not exactly sure I got the question, but yes, in terms of competitiveness, if that's the... That was it. The question. Look, it's a more competitive world. And in that world, we just raised our full year outlook by $1.5 billion and increased our operating margin. So yes, I think, competitively, nothing's really changed in the last 3, 6, 9 months relative to what we expected, and our -- the only thing that's really changed is our performance. But we do know that, going into next year, that our role is to dramatically expand the role we play in our customers' success. So we're expanding the product, the architectures, the packaging technologies, the process capabilities and the software that we build so we can continue to deliver better and better product performance for our customers. And I'd just say that we feel really good about where we are, but we're not complacent by any means in terms of an increased competitive environment as we go into 2020. Yes. I think, Stacy, you've got the numbers right. $200 million was on the enterprise and government and comms area. And that's -- I would say it was more in line with our expectations. Once you take out that $200 million number, we had expected it to come up a little bit. The growth year-over-year was definitely above our expectations and... Yes, that was a fairly big number for us relative to our expectations. Yes. Look, I think in terms of the makeup of the business, for data center, you got roughly 2/3 is cloud and comms and roughly 1/3 is enterprise and government. So that, as you know, has changed dramatically over the years as we've continued to grow our presence in the cloud, and as I mentioned earlier to Joe's question, I think, gained share in comms. So now we're in kind of 2/3, 1/3 state. And enterprise and government was -- across the board in DCG in the quarter, the strength was much higher than we anticipated back in July. We had a first half to second half acceleration, but the acceleration was just more than we expected. And yes, I would say we saw strength across the board. But as we look at the E&G growth in particular, we're trying to determine what is kind of -- what has the tendency to like pull in versus what can we count on as we project things forward. And our best guess on our stronger performance is that the $1.2 billion that we are over, roughly $200 million of that was particularly related to enterprise and government than particularly related to China. Yes. I mean, first, to the comment, yes, the -- nothing new about process relative to what we said at Analyst Day, ramp 10, 2-year cadence for 7 and our expectations that the cadence going forward will be more like 2- to 2.5-year time frame. So intently focused on 10 now and 7 for the product you mentioned in the fourth quarter. So we're investing to recapture process leadership going forward. At the same time, we're going to be extremely open-minded about how do we ensure that we're building the best products, and where we build them is something that we'll always evaluate. I think, as you know with the other foundry players, they've been a source of our capacities over the years. And our expectation is, to the extent that they can do something to support our growth better and/or for peak kind of demands, we're always going to look at how do we evaluate the opportunity set that's going to position us best to meet our customers' demand for the growing diversity of products that we have in our portfolio. Ross, this is George. Maybe I'll take that. Actually, with respect to 2020, there's no material change to my characterization on the last call where we were talking about a 58% outlook for Q4 and 57% in 2021. And the question was, well, should that -- is there -- are those good proxies for 2020? And my point was we think we'll be closer to 60% than to those numbers. But if you want to think about tailwinds and headwinds going into 2020 that we looked at as we think about that number, so tailwinds will be, obviously, we're going to have lower modem in the mix next year. Memory is starting to come out of that deep-down ASP period, and we think volumes are going to be up as we get a little better supply and demand situation. The headwinds that we're very mindful of is, obviously, 10-nanometer ramping is -- can be a little bit of a headwind on margins and also competitive impact on ASP. So those are the things that we'll continue to look at. But as we look at those today, no material change at all from my previous comments. Yes. I would probably just, I guess, echo. In all the complexity and all the moving parts, George kind of flagged -- what I'd characterize the 4 things that we're really dialing in on. One, going into next year, mix is going to be better because our modem volume will be lower and our NSG profitability will be better. So mix is going to have a -- mix has been a drag on 2019's gross margin, and it will be a big contributor as we go into 2020. And secondly, on the first half of 2019, we had a lot of the on [O] costs, your cost of sales related to pre-PRQ 10-nanometer product. So that will not repeat itself. So those 2 things are good, favorable things. The third thing is just -- George flagged this, I'd just simplify this node transition. And for us, node transition next year is going to be -- 14-nanometer will be a little better in terms of its profitability. Yields won't be dramatically different because we're extremely mature, but depreciation levels will be lower because a lot of these tools have been fully depreciated there because we've been on that node for so long. But for the node transition, 14 will be a little bit better. Our expectation is 10-nanometer yields will continue to improve, but at the same time, the mix of 10 versus 14 will be a little bit of a wait. So node transition will work against us. And we also -- we've tried to, as best we can, take into account competitive dynamics as we exit this year and go into next year. In our quest to play a bigger role in our customers' success, we're going to compete to protect our position and expand the role we play. So those are the 4 things and lots of complexity and lots of moving parts, but we -- a year ago, we dialed in 2019 pretty well. Now we've got to dial in 2020 as well. Bob, you mentioned you're still facing some capacity shortages. I wanted to understand how you're planning capacity for next year. What proportion will be 14? What will be 10? And will that mix require a higher or similar level of capital intensity as we saw this year? Yes. I mean our intention next year is to not be a constraint on our customers' growth, first and foremost. And given that, what I indicated is we expect to increase capacity by 25% next year, which is the same kind of level that we did this year. We expect to do that again. So we believe that data center, we've been in pretty decent shape. But for client, we just want to get to mid-single-digit kind of unit output -- mid- to high single-digit unit output so, one, we can meet what we expect customer demand profiles to be but also so we can rebuild buffer levels of inventory so we can deal with these peaks, et cetera. So we're trying to put the capacity in place, but we think we'll meet the customer demand and try to give us the inventory buffer that has been depleted over the course of the last 9 months or so. In terms of capital, I would just say we'll probably give you more detail on that come January, but George kind of laid out back in May a multiyear view of capital. There wasn't any dramatic changes from kind of where we are now. So obviously, that'll be a function of growth. I would just add one thing to remind everybody is that, in 2019, we made a major shift from spending capital in the memory area to moving that capital over to expand our -- both our 10-nanometer and some 14-nanometer. We continue to add capacity in 14-nanometer and began adding capacity at 7-nanometer as well. So we're very focused on getting the capacity in place that will allow us to take the word shortage out of our quarterly discussions. Yes. I think the trends -- the macro trends that we see haven't subsided at all, and that is this insatiable appetite for the creation of data and the need to compute, process, store, move, make that data more relevant. Those macro trends have been very attractive for the long -- for a while, and we expect those to continue. But to your point, the -- our experience with the cloud providers is they go through big buying cycles and then relatively long digestion periods. What we did experience last year was a gangbuster year, but it's been 3 quarters coming into the third quarter where they went through digestions. And what we started to see in the third quarter was, particularly for high-performance compute, start to see them come back into the market to really begin to purchase a little bit more. So how long that cycle lasts is going to be a function of several variables, but their end demand seems to continue to be relatively strong. And therefore, the need to add capacity, we think, will follow their end demand given they've been out of the market a little bit for about 3 quarters now up 'til Q3. Yes. Look, thanks for joining us. We feel great about the quarter. It's -- we're looking at -- we had a record quarter result, raising our outlook for the full year. The market we see, the trends we see are as big as they've ever been. And we're really focused on continuing to deliver for our customers. 10-nanometer era is now. We're ramping a multitude of products. We have increased confidence in 5-nanometer. And as we mentioned for 7 and 5 getting back to a 2.5-, 2-year cadence is what we're focused on. And we're confident in the future. And you're seeing both in the first 9 months of the year as well as with our higher share buyback that we're putting your money where -- to work to reduce the float because we think there's a disconnect between the intrinsic value of the plan we shared with you back in May and how we're trading. So with our balance sheet, we're taking advantage of that. So thanks for joining us. Thanks for your questions. And we'll talk to you soon.","I guess a question on the data center side. It's just -- to clear up the numbers, it looks like you're suggesting DCG up maybe 5% year-on-year. So can you speak to the accuracy of that? And then, I guess, bigger picture, the comms service provider side, clearly, a very large source of strength for you guys, up 11% year-on-year and now representing more than 40% of the mix. So curious if you can kind of speak to the most important drivers of that business and how you're thinking about growth over the next 1, 2, 3 years? Congratulations on the solid results. I want to stick with DCG, Bob. If you look, impressive, but ASPs were up 9% year-over-year, especially as the mix shifted towards the comms business, which I believe tends to be lower ASPs. It's also happening in the quarter where you're seeing your competitor ramping their next-generation chips. So I guess I'm trying to understand what's the power of the Xeon Scalable upgrade cycle you referred to in your prepared comments? What inning are we in, in your mind? How much of an ASP lift can that give you? And do you anticipate any unusual pricing action as competition heats up in this market? Multiple parts. Bob, I wanted to go through the priority and the cadence that you talked about, bringing it back to 2, 2.5 here. Is that -- because my understanding is that they were just simply laws of physics that were causing the cadence to stretch out. So what problems have the engineers and the process folks solved out there? Or is it just limited to the 7-nanometer, and then you would revisit that again? I'll ask one question that (technical difficulty) Pierre, you're breaking up. Okay. Let me -- a little better now? A little bit. Okay. So my question is really about your competitive landscape. So your main competitor [indicate 86] ecosystem has produced in the last 10 months or 9 (technical difficulty) that's why it's not even impressive in the data center and also (technical difficulty). And so my question is what's your perception on the evolution of your competitive landscape in the last 3 months? Are things [being mainly] in line with what you had in mind and what you are expecting when we spoke over the summer? And then how much of like the footprint you have in the data-centric you think you can produce competition with that in mind? Pierre, let me kind of reframe that maybe. I think you were talking about competition and how we feel about that now maybe... I was wondering if you could tell us, within your enterprise, cloud and comm businesses in DCG, in the quarter, how much of each of those was driven by China? And given the 200-millimeter -- $200 million pull-forward across enterprise and cloud that you mentioned -- enterprise and comm that you mentioned, was that beating enterprise relative to your expectations more or less than $200 million? So by more than $200 million? So how much of enterprise was China then? Bob, it sounds like -- for 10-nanometer, it sounds like Ice Lake is still on track for the second half of next year. And it sounds like the 7-nanometer GPGPU is still on track for 2021. You did talk about, for the first time, about 5-nanometer. So can you talk a little bit about how you think of make versus outsource? And really what I'm after is, is sort of anything sacred? Or if going to a foundry partner to make CPU or maybe even like a chiplet strategy, if that would eliminate a significant piece of your competitive disadvantage, would you consider that? Or is that sort of off the table for now? I wanted to ask on gross margin. A year ago in your third quarter call, Bob, you gave some directional commentary on what you thought for the out-year, for 2019. Today, as we look into 2020, you have a lot of moving parts with 2 nodes ramping, 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, yields, competition, lots of moving parts, admittedly. But I was hoping, at least versus maybe the fourth quarter exit rate this year, that you could give some puts and takes on how you're feeling about next year's gross margin. Great job on the quarterly execution. Last time we had a cloud and enterprise spending digestion pause was first half of 2017. It's kind of the same setup as this past, right? Similar to 2017, DCG had strong second half growth. And in fact, back in 2017, it kicked off what was a 4- or 5-quarter period of strong spending by your cloud customers. Do you guys get a sense in discussions with your customers that the spending reacceleration is sustainable for the next few quarters? I mean if I look at things like compute workload growth, that continues at a strong pace. Workload themselves are getting more complex. And so just wanted to get your views on sustainability of the strong growth profile in DCG into next year. Thanks, Harlan. We're going to hand the call back over to Bob for some closing comments. Thanks, Bob and George, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Operator, could you please go ahead and wrap up the call?

INTC,Q1 2020,3521,3530,1004,"Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. We had an outstanding Q1 in the midst of incredibly challenging circumstances. We generated $19.8 billion in revenue, expanded operating margin by 10 points and delivered $1.45 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $800 million on the top line and $0.15 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and now represent approximately 51% of the company's revenue, and our PC-centric business grew 14%. We'll talk about business trends later, but first, I want to thank and commend all the Intel employees and supply chain partners who have helped keep our business operating during this unprecedented challenge. I want to give a special praise to those in our factories and labs and other on-site personnel who have role modeled the values of our company every day and every shift. I am so incredibly proud of your effort and commitment. I also want to thank the rest of our employees who are largely working remotely to help support the social distancing requirements of those that need to work from our sites. Ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce has and will continue to be our #1 priority. That's why we are investing more than $100 million in additional benefits to aid and support employees, including a special recognition award for employees that have been working on site. Intel's purpose is to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth. Never before has our delivery of that purpose been more essential. Intel technology runs 95% of the world's Internet communication and government digital infrastructure. And in a world where many of us are working remotely and socially distancing, the PCs and networking technologies delivered by Intel and our customers are providing a unifying fabric that's bringing us closer together, helping those directly struggling with the virus or caring for those who are enabling remote classrooms so that our children can continue to learn and connecting governments and businesses so they can operate and deliver goods and services. Around the world, Intel platforms that support telemedicines have also taken on greater importance since the outbreak of COVID-19 as hospitals and health care workers scale to meet the increasing demand for care. Our products and capabilities are also delivering vital computing power for medical research, robotics for assisted patient care and artificial intelligence and data analytics for public health. We recognize that our local and global communities need us to continue delivering technology to help overcome this COVID-19 challenge, and we're fully focused on that task. Our world-class safety standards have allowed our factories to continue to operate safely on a relatively normal basis with greater than 90% on-time delivery. We only allow employees in our factories who are essential to the factories' operations. By design, our clean rooms and factories are among the cleanest places in the world. While most of our construction projects have remained operational, we have had to temporarily pause a few projects due to local government restrictions at a small number of our sites. We will restart those projects in due course, and we expect these interruptions to have minimal impact on our ramp and no impact on our process technology transition time line. We also realized that solving the enormous challenge of COVID-19 requires catalyzing the world's innovation in new ways. Intel is committed to accelerating access to technology that can combat the current pandemic and enable new technology and scientific discovery to better prepare society for future crisis. To that end, we've pledged $50 million in a global pandemic response technology initiative to combat the coronavirus through improved access to technology at the point of patient care, to speed scientific research and to ensure access to online learning for students and teachers. We are also granting free access to our IP to all COVID-19 researchers and scientists. At the same time, we also know that our communities need help right now. Between Intel and our foundation, we are providing $10 million towards coronavirus relief in the communities where we have significant presence. This will aid community organizations focused on food security, shelter, medical equipment and small business support. We also want to assist our communities' critically important health care workers in any way possible, so we have committed more than 1 million items of personal protective equipment. We have already started delivering masks, gloves, face shields and other gear that we've sourced from our supply chain and inventory on hand to local health authorities who are best positioned to determine the areas of greatest need. Beyond Intel's donations, our employees inspire us every day with the many ways they are applying their skills, generous spirit and technical innovation to help people and communities across the globe persevere through this crisis. George will give more detail on what we're seeing and expect in the business. But first, I want to reiterate our strategy and priorities. Even as COVID-19 drives significant disruptions across the globe, our long-term strategy, to deliver the world's best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world, is unchanged. And the environment is uncertain, but our priorities are unwavering. We are focused on accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Over the last several years, we've transformed the company and are now positioned to grow our share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We live in a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals and our factories. Additionally, we have redefined Intel Inside to include much more than the CPU as we've expanded our silicon offering to include ASICS, FPGAS, GPUs and Optane, among other capabilities. Our opportunity set is more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so that we can have a larger impact on our customers' success. And our quarterly results demonstrate the benefits of that diversity. Nowhere is growth accelerating more than in our cloud and networking businesses where we are helping our customers transform the way they move, store and process data. Through this crisis, the world's cloud and network infrastructure has delivered massive scaling to support vital workloads for businesses and consumers. Cloud-delivered applications seen as conveniences a quarter ago, such as online shopping and video collaboration, have now become indispensable. We scaled our cloud and communication service provider businesses by 53% and 33% year-over-year, respectively, to help our customers meet these growing needs. These 2 segments now drive 70% of our data center segment revenue. New usage and market needs are also pushing compute resources closer to the data source or point-of-service delivery, giving rise to an increasingly intelligent edge. Our edge business delivers a wide range of platforms, including some innovative solutions that are helping the medical community tackle COVID-19. One example is Medical Informatics' Sickbay platform. Powered by Intel technology, this solution can turn beds into virtual ICU beds in minutes, helping protect critical health care workers while expanding their care capacity significantly. Houston Methodist Hospital deployed Sickbay for its virtual ICU and was able to leverage it within 1 day to support remote monitoring of its COVID-19 patients without risking exposure to care providers. We are also partnering closely with Medtronic and Dyson as they use Intel technologies to deliver much needed ventilators. We also continue to demonstrate significant progress in ADAS and autonomous driving. While auto vehicle production is largely stalled, Mobileye delivered another proof point, demonstrating its leadership position with a landmark first-ever design win with a major Asian OEM. Finally, we see AI as a significant growth opportunity and are embedding AI capability into everything we make. AI has the power to reimagine how we solve problems across industries, including cutting-edge health care diagnostics, for example, in China, Intel teams with Lenovo and BGI Genomics to accelerate the analysis of genomic characteristics of COVID-19. Our combined work will further advance the capabilities of BGI sequencing tools to help scientists investigate transmission patterns of the virus and create better diagnostic methods. And in India, we are working with government labs, academia and industry to achieve faster and cheaper testing, accelerate drug discovery through virus genome sequencing and help architect a pandemic response platform. We acquired Habana in the fourth quarter of last year to strengthen our AI portfolio and accelerate our efforts in a nascent, fast-growing AI silicon market that we expect will grow to $25 billion by 2024. This quarter, we have largely completed the integration. We consolidated product road maps, aligned software resources and are executing to our deal thesis. We are also now sampling Habana's first deep learning training processor to large CSPs. I'll now take a few minutes to discuss how we're executing to our supply and road map objectives. Shortly after our January call, we started to see the impact of COVID-19 in China, forcing many of our ODM partners to extend Chinese New Year factory shutdowns. ODM partners have now returned to work, and production is increasing every week. As I mentioned earlier, our factories remain operational. And in Q1, we are able to mitigate most of the COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions and fulfill all of our customers' committed client CPU orders as expected. We remain on track to add sufficient wafer capacity this year so that we meet market demand and restore our PC unit inventory to more normal levels. Near-term PC demand has increased due to work from home and online learning, but the second half demand picture is more uncertain. We continue to assess how COVID-19 impacts to the economy will offset the immediate catalysts for more remote work and will balance wafer start plans accordingly. We have made strong progress on a wave of 10-nanometer-based product introductions this year. This quarter, we announced the new Intel Atom P5900 SoC, Snow Ridge, a 10-nanometer-based new addition to our portfolio of 5G capabilities. We are a leading silicon provider in 5G infrastructure, and Snow Ridge expands our reach to the fullest edges of the network. With major design wins at Ericsson, Nokia and ZTE, we expect to be the base station market segment leader by 2021, a year earlier than previously committed. In the middle of this year, we'll debut our next-generation mobile processor, Tiger Lake. Using our second-generation 10-nanometer process, Tiger Lake will deliver breakthrough performance, and our customers have more than 50 fantastic Tiger Lake-based notebook designs lined up for the holiday season. Finally, in the latter part of 2020, we continue to expect initial production shipments of our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake. While product development in a work-from-home environment is extremely challenging, we are largely on track for our 2020 product deliverables. We are always mindful of our role as stewards and thoughtful allocators of your capital. We generate significant cash flow and have an excellent balance sheet. We're committed to our dividends, and we repurchased $4.2 billion in shares during the quarter. In light of the uncertainty, we took some actions to dramatically strengthen our liquidity position that we felt were prudent. We raised $10.3 billion in debt to further underpin an already strong balance sheet, and we suspended our share buybacks. We think this level of conservatism is appropriate at this phase, and we intend to reinstate our buyback program as circumstances warrant. Our focus now is on investing in our products and process technology and ensuring we have the capacity to meet our customer needs. We also continue to take a disciplined approach to our portfolio of investments, including an agreement to divest our Home Gateway Platform business. We have transformed our company to lead the data-driven revolution that's fueling our industry. Our belief is that opportunity is resolute. COVID-19 has only reinforced how important it is for Intel and our customers to accelerate the power of data to fight the current pandemic and avert the next one. To use Andy Grove's words, bad companies are destroyed by crises. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them. Guided by our cultural values, competitive advantages and financial strength, we will emerge from this situation even stronger. I'll now hand the call over to George for more details on our Q1 results, our Q2 outlook and how we're actively managing the business through this challenge. Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 marked a strong start to the year amidst significant economic uncertainty and the unexpectedly strong demand for both PCs and servers as work-from-home and learn-from-home dynamics played out globally. Revenue came in at $19.8 billion, up 23% year-on-year and $800 million higher than guide. Data-centric revenue of $10.1 billion, up 34% year-on-year, represented 51% of our total revenue, an all-time high. Strong server demand across segments and a richer mix of our Xeon devices drove a significant portion of the upside. Q1 PC-centric revenue was $9.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales and increased supply resulting from capacity additions over the past year. Gross margin for the quarter was 62%, beating expectations due to strong flow-through of higher platform revenue, partly offset by reserves associated with our memory business and from the sale of our Home Gateway Business. Operating margin of 38% in the quarter was up 10 points versus last year on higher gross margins and disciplined spending controls, consistent with the environment. Q1 EPS was $1.45, $0.15 above our guide on strong operational performance, partially offset by losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios, along with the effects of a slightly higher tax rate. The strength of these results show the remarkable talent and commitment of our global workforce in a difficult and rapidly evolving environment. In Q1, we generated $6.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $3.3 billion in CapEx with $2.9 billion of free cash flow, up 76% year-over-year. We returned $5.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As Bob mentioned, we announced a pause in our share repurchase program as we felt it was prudent to do so in the current economic environment. This does not change our commitment to returning $20 billion in repurchases as outlined in October last year, and we plan to resume the program when market dynamics stabilize. With Q1 buybacks at $4.2 billion, we have already more than offset expected dilution associated with employee stock compensation for this year. In addition, our dividend policy remains unchanged with $1.4 billion in dividends paid in Q1. Let's move to segment performance in Q1. Data Center Group revenue of $7 billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations with strength across our customer landscape. Year-over-year platform volumes and ASPs were up 27% and 13%, respectively. While year-over-year comparisons benefited from a weak Q1 '19, revenue in the quarter came in at the second-highest level ever for DCG. Revenue was up 53% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government and 33% for communication service providers. DCG adjacencies also delivered solid growth with revenue up 35% year-on-year on strong adoption of networking solutions. Our other data-centric businesses were up 19% year-over-year in Q1 despite more tangible COVID impact. IOTG operating income declined 3%, primarily on lower revenue from industrial and retail. Mobileye revenue and operating income were up 22% and 29%, respectively, driven by continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches, offset partially by eroding conditions in the automotive market. While Q1 marked a record for Mobileye revenue, we expect 2020 revenue growth will be lower than our prior expectations as automobile production and volume ramps are being materially impacted by COVID-19. NSG revenue grew 46% on strong bit growth and improved pricing. Better market conditions versus last year, along with cost reductions on strong factory performance, resulted in a lower operating loss of $66 million. PSG revenue grew 7% year-on-year on cloud and enterprise strength, partially offset by weaker embedded and communications segment. Operating income was up 9% on higher revenue. CCG revenue was $9.8 billion in Q1, up 14% year-over-year, driven by notebook market strength and higher modem sales. PC unit volumes were up 13% year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply. Notebook demand strength is expected to continue into Q2 with more people working and learning from home due to COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders. Operating margin was 43%, up 7 points year-on-year, on higher revenue and lower spending driven by the 5G smartphone modem exits, partially offset by higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products. Let's move to our second quarter outlook. Given the environment and the global economy, the range of potential outcomes has a wider distribution than normal. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect the strength in cloud and comms infrastructure to continue in Q2, while IOTG and Mobileye will see lower demand driven by COVID-19. As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.5 billion with PC-centric approximately flat to slightly up year-over-year and data-centric up approximately 25% year-over-year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%, down 1 point year-on-year on lower gross margin, largely offset by lower spending on higher revenue. Gross margins are expected to be approximately 56%, down 6 points sequentially due primarily to 3 reasons: prequalification reserves associated with the ramp of our next 10-nanometer client product, code named Tiger Lake; lower sequential revenue; and an accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products, including isolate client CPUs and 5G SoC. The Tiger lake reserves are not expected to impact full year gross margin as we expect to sell through the reserve inventory in the second half of the year. As a result, Q2 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share. Moving to the full year. With limited visibility due to the uncertainty driven by COVID-19, we are not guiding the full year. However, I do want to spend a few minutes discussing the expected headwinds and tailwinds we are monitoring and our response to the market dynamics. Tailwinds are most evident in the first half of the year on strong demand for mobile compute and related infrastructure on the dynamics of sheltering in place. In particular, mobile PCs, cloud and network infrastructure for 5G remain above seasonal trends. Headwinds include the impact of a global recession on IOTG end markets, particularly industrial and retail, lower automotive production impacting Mobileye and slowing enterprise and government data center demand. We also expect the PC TAM to weaken in the second half as GDP effects outweigh the initial demand bump from COVID. Also, given the volatility of the margins in Q1, our losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios were negatively impacting EPS by $0.03. Given the uncertain environment, this remains a watch item for the remainder of the year. In response to these market dynamics, we acted swiftly and strengthened liquidity. In addition to spending repurchases, we issued $10.3 billion in debt in the quarter. Our total cash investment balance at quarter end was $20.8 billion. Our liquidity actions to date are expected to impact full year EPS performance by approximately $0.12. The company has an exceptional balance sheet and strong cash flow to handle a very wide range of scenarios. We have positioned the company to support investment in technology transitions, our new products, and our customers' requirements across these scenarios. As you would expect, we are very focused on cash flow management and believe our free cash flow generation this year will be resilient as impacts from COVID are tempered by first half demand strength, OpEx savings initiatives, capital actions and tight working capital oversight. To conclude, I'd like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide who are working diligently in these challenging times to provide products essential to the world. With that, I'll hand it back to Trey, and we'll get to your questions. All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first call.","Yes. Thanks, John. So the margin picture is really unchanged from what we've talked about in the past in terms of how we think our product road map is going to move products that we expect to introduce and their margin structure. And what you're seeing in Q2 is largely a timing issue. And about half of the impact that you're seeing in gross margin in the quarter is from the Tiger Lake pre PRQ reserves. Obviously, the fact that -- and that's both sequentially and year-over-year. And so I think the way we would look at it is pretty much we're not seeing anything as -- if you take COVID out of the year, we're really not seeing anything different in our basic view of gross margin dynamics, with the exception of we're seeing stronger pull-in of demand for some of our 10-nanometer products. I mean I think one of the things -- we got very strong demand for Tiger Lake. And so when you look at the impact that Tiger Lake reserves are having on the quarter, it's about the same level of impact that we had on Ice Lake in Q1 of '19. And yet we have about double the number of units in the -- being reserved. And I think it gives you an indication of just how much our performance was improving on 10-nanometer. So John, I would just say, relative to where we were 90 days ago, gross margins are stronger through the first quarter. They're in line with our expectations through the second quarter. And to George's point, despite the timing dynamics of pre PRQ reserves that we take in the second quarter and recoup in the second half, the only other change is just that we feel confident in accelerating the ramp for 10. So from our vantage point, at or better than kind of how we started the year, and we feel very good about gross margin performance. We're very excited about the Tiger Lake products ramping going into the second half and the 5G Snow Ridge product that we announced. So all in all, gross margin dynamics, pretty strong. On the second part of your question, I'd go back to the commentary that George provided back at our Analyst Day in the spring, which is, obviously, when we transition from a mature node to a new node, margins tend to come down. We indicated that we plan to get back on a 2- to 2.5-year cadence, which means in 2021, we'll be ramping 10-nanometer even more while we're investing in 7-nanometer that we anticipate having in the fourth quarter of 2021. So those dynamics of -- from a mature node to a new node, impacts the gross margins of the business, but we feel like it's -- we're well on track from the plans we laid out and feel pretty good about a dynamite first quarter and an outlook for the second quarter in line or better than what we expected. I guess a follow-on, John, with the gross margin. I mean I know you're not guiding full year anymore, but when we look out at that trajectory that you had given us, I was wondering if you can just kind of step us through with the acceleration. And actually, maybe looking back to last year, if you look at the improvement you saw of that low quarter, just kind of any kind of directional guidance of where this gross margin can go from here. Yes. I mean first off, I think you're going to see, Blayne, that gross margin is going to improve, all things being equal, just from the fact that starting in the third quarter, we'll start to see the chips that have been reserved this quarter coming out on a 0 cost basis in the gross margin. And again, it's really hard to think about the second half in terms of how demand is going to look compared to what we ultimately thought when we first gave guidance, which is because of the -- all the obvious issues related to COVID. I'd just go back to -- as we look at what we guided all the way back in May of '19, if anything, we're ramping 10-nanometer a little faster. We're seeing clear evidence of improved performance on 10-nanometer. And so we feel good about the overall gross margin dynamics. You can see how our other cost initiatives are helping 5 points out of the 6-point impact that's being offset by effectively the OpEx percentage. So overall, I would go back and say no real change to our fundamental outlook. But when you overlay COVID, it's -- we'll just have to see how that plays out. I appreciate all the color in these uncertain times. I'm curious how you are directionally feeling about the CapEx guidance for the year. I think you had about a $17 billion number before. I understand the need to be responsive to the macro dynamics and in preserving the balance sheet. But you upsided first half by quite a bit, and you're also accelerating the move to 10-nanometers. Does that create some upward bias or at least protect the kind of capital spending plans that you had for the year? Any puts and takes would be very helpful. Yes. Vivek, I'll start, and then George will fill in. First, both our R&D and our capital spend for this year are directed towards the multiyear plan that we shared with you back last year. So both the product road map over the next several years, the capital required to support the growth that we anticipate over the medium- to long-term horizon while adding capacity for the ramp of 10 as well. So coming into the year, we're very bullish about the medium- and long-term outlook. And we're putting our capital to work to support that medium- and long-term outlook, and that's not going to change. That being said, in the near term, as we try to get a better read on what the demand signals will be for the second half, whether we're dealing with being very disciplined on our spending levels, ensuring that wafer starts are in line with true demand signals and being very disciplined on the capital that isn't directly related to more capacity and/or technology development, we are going to be very disciplined through this near-term horizon. But I'd just go back to the first point, which is we're very bullish about the multiyear view. We have the largest TAM in the company's history. We got a great set of products that we're building and developing, and we're going to invest to position ourselves well to capitalize on the current disruptions that we're wrestling with. Yes. What I would add is there's some natural things in addition to the discipline that will help us lower CapEx a little bit. It's part of why we said we think our free cash flow is going to be pretty resilient in the year because we've seen in some of the geographies where we have major construction projects underway, we're actually seeing that being pushed somewhat by regulatory requirements. And so we -- the way I would describe it is we probably see 6 to 8 weeks' worth of capital pushing out of this year. But any capital that is important for our 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer and even the start of 5-nanometer is going to be spent in line with the timetables that we've already laid out. Great. I wonder if you could talk about some of the changes to the server road map? And it seems like you've deemphasized Cooper Lake and are more focused on Ice Lake server. Is that about confidence of the -- in the 10-nanometer plus? Is that -- just kind of describe what led to that decision. Yes. Thanks, Joe. Yes, during the course of the year, we've been -- our product road map for servers is very focused on delivering workload-optimized platform foundation that's scalable for the real-world environments that our customers are operating in. So we ramped -- Skylake was the fastest ramp in the Xeon history, followed by Cascade Lake, that was a very strong ramp. Next, we have a Cascade Lake refresh that is a relatively simple, simple upgrade, easier upgrade for our customers because the architecture is very simple to the fastest-growing Cascade Lake ramp. And we're very focused on Ice Lake in the second half of the year or in the fourth quarter, as we indicated. So as we step back and look at the market dynamics and the product road map, we feel like we got the right products at the right time as we ramp and scale the high end of Cascade Lake and refresh while positioning for Ice Lake. Okay. That makes sense. And as you've started to ramp 10-nanometer plus, is it possible to talk about the changes that you'll see versus 10? Is it better clock speeds, better yields, better -- is there better transistor performance implicit in that transition? I presume you're talking about second gen for server products, Sapphire Rapids product or -- oh, for clients, sorry. Yes, the client -- the Tiger Lake product, we are extremely excited about. We -- as I think I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have 50 designs that we expect to ramp in the holiday season this year. Clock speed, battery life, AI incorporation into the core design, a platform offering that we think is a real differentiator for customers on -- in thin and light format. So this is going to be a great launch. We're very excited about it. And to George's earlier point, the demand signals we're seeing and our confidence in both the product and the yield is -- has us at a point where we expect to accelerate the ramp and adoption a bit faster than we did coming into the year. Stacy, this is George. I don't think we'll see a crossover point this year. And this is -- again, I'm just going to take COVID out of the equation, so thinking through, I do think we're going to see more demand on 10-nanometer this year than we thought going in. Again, I think Ice Lake demand was strong -- is going to be strong in the first half. We're seeing our 5G SoCs on 10-nanometer getting stronger demand as the market there just gets stronger and stronger on the comp side. But Tiger Lake is really, I think, going to be the driver for us in being above our expectations for all the reasons that Bob just covered. And -- but it won't be enough to cause a crossover. Yes. Thanks, Ross. First, on the cloud side, as you indicated, we came into the year off a very strong second half of 2019, and our expectations were that Q1 would continue that strength. But then the cloud service providers would go through their normal digestion stage, if you will. That was kind of what we indicated back in January. First quarter, as George flagged, demand was even stronger for the CSPs. In our raised outlook for Q2, we expect that demand for the cloud folks to -- the strong demand to continue. And possibly, even going into the second half of the year, that's TBD, but the trends are relatively encouraging, the demand signals are very high. The product that's being pulled is the XCC product. So ASPs, as you saw in our results, were very strong. So purchasing is extending beyond what we thought a few months ago. And that drove Q1 upside, it drove Q2 upside, and we think it will be relatively strong kind of going into Q3. That's TBD. On the comms side, fantastic growth in the first quarter. Our expectations are, as we go through the course of the year, it will stay relatively strong as we continue to gain share in that segment. And as we've expanded the 5G SoC, expanded our TAM within that sector and with the product that we just qualified a few weeks back. So we expect share gains, the infrastructure -- share gains to continue, infrastructure in 5G to continue, if not go faster, and we're relatively well positioned in the -- with the key players of Nokia, Ericsson and ZTE going into the second half of the year. So we feel good about the comms segment as well. And as you flagged, the ones that we're proud -- that we're most anxious about is just enterprise and government and what kind of demand signals we'll see in the second half. So the first 2 are as good, if not stronger. Enterprise and government, a big -- a bit of an unknown for us at this stage. Pierre, it's George. I think what we saw is clearly some impact relative to our expectations from the work-at-home, learn-at-home dynamics. But we had expected a strong quarter in our initial forecast, which really reflected the dynamics that we're talking about. We had customers who have been short of demand for a number of quarters who were seeing a chance to finally build some -- a little bit of inventory, which gave us a seasonally strong first quarter relative to anything we might see historically. But we saw notebook volumes up over 20% in the quarter. And I would say that that's more than just the pent-up demand. And that's at a time when some of the OEMs were really struggling in the early part of the quarter with their supply chains, which is why there's some parts in their channel that's all opened up now. So we think that actually -- one of the good signs is though even that's opened up, we're still seeing very strong demand coming in on the PC side. So -- and we had expected solid PC in the first half. But I would say it's -- with COVID, it's been even stronger and heavily weighted towards the netbook. And the only thing I would add is in our fab network and the supply chain was able to -- coming out of last year, not only able to deal with the backlog coming into the year but also meet the higher demand signals that George flagged at the latter part of March. Yes. I should have mentioned that. It's really heroic work, both at the supply chain level, we have a fantastic supply chain group, but also our manufacturing teams, keeping the factories up and running. Delivering a 90% on-time commits in a quarter like this is really remarkable. Yes. We're -- I'm not going to be able to give you a full year guide by pieces. But I appreciate the question. I think the -- maybe talking a little bit, C.J., headwinds and tailwinds, which we referred to on the call, clearly, cloud is a tailwind and -- cloud and mobile compute are a tailwind for the first half for sure. I think cloud continues to be -- will probably be helpful throughout the year. The -- but at some point, we're going to see the impacts of the recession start to impact demand on PCs. So we're -- that's certainly a headwind. That is a reasonable expectation for the second half of the year. We're already seeing the impact of the recession on IOTG, particularly in industrial and retail. We're seeing in automotive, Mobileye had a record quarter in Q1. But I think the full year is going to be certainly weaker than we had expected coming into the year. Now not nearly as weak as automotive overall because they continue to grow. They're in a part of the automotive market that is growing substantially. And they have the leadership position in ADAS. And so it will be more subtle of an impact, but still an impact nonetheless. And then as Bob said, on the data center side, enterprise and government appear to have been very strong in the first half, and so we would expect some digestion. How those things all play up and what percentages play out, C.J., I really can't say, but those are the things that we're watching to see how the year is going to play out. Well, I think the things that are structural is we're going to see more 10-nanometer demand in the year than we had forecasted at the beginning of the year. And that will have a little bit of dampening on margins but not materially different from what we had seen coming into the year. The temporary impact is really the reserve action, which will reverse. It is about half of the year-over-year effect. And so I would say the other impact, again, is if we look year-over-year, we're just seeing a much larger uptake of Ice Lake and 5G SoCs year-over-year, but much of that was expected. I would say both Ice Lake and the 5G SoCs are a little bit stronger than we would have thought coming into the year and -- which is consistent with just the demand activity that we're seeing in mobility and the infrastructure around that. Yes. And just we came into the year with an outlook of 59% gross margin for the year. And I would just say through the first 90 days, we're much better. To the next 90 days, we're better or in line. And the dynamics of the pre PRQ reserve are no impact on the full year. Therefore, net-net, to the first 6 months of the year, we feel just as good about our gross margin performance and even better about our ability to ramp 10-nanometer. So we're feeling very good about how the first half of the year is playing out relative to where we were 90 days ago across demand signals and gross margin performance. We're -- obviously, we're very focused on understanding that. I would say the -- any kind of dislocation that we're looking at right now is more a function of just the supply chain challenges that some of the OEMs had, particularly in the first half of the first quarter. But we've been watching that pretty closely because we want to make sure that this kind of buildup at our customer level makes its way through to the end customer. And we're seeing customers telling us that their end-customer demand continues to be very strong, and their order profile reflects they're going to clear their existing revenue. Now when that plays out, I'm not sure. It's part of why we struggle to understand how that second half is going to play out. But we feel good about the demand signals we're seeing now, and we understand the movements of our products in the system from the dynamics that we saw in the first quarter. Yes. On -- as we indicated at the beginning of the year, our intention -- well, we did add capacity last year, and our intention this year was to add another mid-20% growth in capacity, which would generate real strong output. And we are on track, maybe even a little bit better than what we said at the time. Obviously, in the first quarter, demand was also greater. It was greater for -- across the board, server and notebook, in particular. And we were able to keep pace with accelerating demand as the quarter closed. So we're in pretty good shape in terms of the promise we've made to our customers, and that is that we will not -- we'll put the capacity in place so we are not a constraint on their growth. So we're in very good shape despite all the challenges. That being said by, we haven't replenished inventory levels. So meaning mix dynamics across the board is -- we're still not quite there yet, but we're in line a little bit better than we had hoped. We delivered more demand, and we got to continue to build the inventory levels back so we can deal with the variation by SKU mix. Yes. So look, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I just kind of want to wrap with -- to reiterate our purpose, and that is to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth. And that's never been more important than it is during this time. Our strategy is resolute, and our business is built to withstand challenges. We have a very diversified portfolio of businesses that are highly leveraged to major technology inflections like cloud, 5G, intelligent and autonomous edge computing and artificial intelligence. We generate significant and durable free cash flows, and our team of 110,000 people is operating as one team to enable our customers' success. So guided by our cultural values, our competitive advantages and our financial strength, we're confident that we will emerge from this situation even stronger. Thanks again for joining us. We hope you all stay safe as we work together to overcome this global crisis. And we look forward to hopefully seeing you in person over the near term. Thanks again for joining us.","I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the gross margin decline heading into the calendar second quarter. George, you kind of broke it up into 3 different categories. I'd be interested on magnitude of Tiger Lake versus just lower volumes and then other 10-nanometer parts. And I guess, more importantly, how do we think about kind of normalized sort of gross margins as you get past some of the start-up costs for a faster 10-nanometer ramp? I wanted to ask first about the 10-nanometer mix exiting the year just given what you're seeing: a strong Tiger Lake demand signals and a potentially faster 10-nanometer. Like what do you think your product mix by node is going to be exiting the year? Do you think there'll be a crossover point on 10-nanometers? I want to go to the Data Center Group, you have the color commentary about the enterprise and government being weaker in the second half, and I don't think that surprises anybody. But I wanted to see what sort of color you're getting in the other 70% of that segment on the cloud and the comms side? And specifically, you had worried earlier this year that we'd enter a digestion period. So I wanted to see if your views have changed on that. And then in the comms service provider side, how much of that actually acts like the enterprise and government versus the side that benefits from the 5G ramp? Any pluses and minuses there would be helpful as well. I'd like to get back to your performance in PC in the first quarter. So you're up 14% year-on-year. I was wondering a couple of things. The first one is how much is that really stronger demand, and that's just about it? And how much of that is more you catching up on capacity and being better able to serve the market and catching up maybe on demand you couldn't meet in the 2, 3 previous quarters? And then what's your early view on market share? Are you starting to regain share in PCs? And if not, when do you see that happening this year? I realized that you removed your guidance for the full year. But if I look at your results and your guide for Q2, it would suggest data-centric tracking, maybe down 2% half-on-half in the second half; and PC, down 14%. I'm just curious, is that directionally how you're seeing things? Or I guess given the positive trends in notebooks and the weakness on the enterprise and government side, perhaps it's a bit more muted, and would love to hear your thoughts on that. George, I want to go back to the gross margins. I think you did a great job giving us color about half of the impact from Tiger Lake. I'm just wondering, the remaining half, is that because of reserves, which is going to reverse in the second half? Or is this something more structural or mix related that's going to persist for the next few quarters? I would love to hear some color on that. I'm just wondering if you can talk about channel. Inventory, there's a -- customers in a lot of your end markets seem to be a little concerned about supply disruptions, and they -- sell-in seems to be a little bit above sell-through. Sell-through seems to be weakening a little bit. So can you talk about the potential for some inventory correction later this year and sort of how you track that? Operator, I think we have time for one more question, and then we'll turn the call back over to Bob to wrap things up. Can you just run down the supply demand sort of balance throughout the server, desktop and notebook lines? I guess are you on track for the high single-digit unit increase in output? And then did the shortages anywhere get any worse during the during Q1? Or it sounds like they're abating in certain areas? Just any color there would be great. Thanks, Bob, and thank you all for joining us today. Operator, could you please go ahead and wrap up the call?

INTC,Q4 2019,3321,3715,1026,"Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's fourth quarter earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available on the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Trey. We exceeded our expectations for Q4 '19, capping off a fourth consecutive record year. In Q4, we generated $20.2 billion in revenue and $1.52 in earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $1 billion and $0.28, respectively. For the full year, we delivered $72 billion in revenue and $4.87 in EPS. The PC, Data Center, IoT, Memory and Mobileye businesses each set all-time annual revenue records. Several years ago, we began a transformation to reposition the company to take advantage of the data revolution that is reshaping computing. Exiting this quarter, we now have greater than 50% of our revenue coming from our data-centric collection of businesses, but our journey is just beginning. To reach our multiyear goals, we will continuously focus on 3 key priorities: accelerating growth, improving execution and deploying our capital for attractive returns. I'd like to share our progress against these priorities over the last 90 days. We are accelerating growth by expanding the capabilities of our workload-optimized platforms, playing a larger role in our customers' success. Demand for our Intel Xeon Scalable processors is very strong as customers continue to make Xeon the foundation for their AI-infused data center workloads. One of the reasons Cascade Lake is our fastest-ramping Xeon CPU is its unrivaled AI performance. Xeon's AI performance will take another step in the first half of 2020 when our third generation Xeon Scalable processor, Cooper Lake, debuts. Cooper Lake features new Intel DL Boost extensions for built-in AI training acceleration, providing up to a 60% increase in training performance over the previous family. Additionally, we've been expanding beyond the CPU, in the Data Center, with products such as Optane persistent memory, custom ASICs, Ethernet and silicon photonics. In Q4, Data Center adjacent products grew more than 30% year-over-year. In client computing, we are seeing excellent momentum for our first 10-nanometer mobile CPU, Ice Lake, with 44 system designs already shipping. In addition to our CPU capabilities, we continue to deliver leadership PC platform connectivity. With WiFi 6, we're delivering gig plus speeds. And for wired connectivity, we just announced Thunderbolt 4 for platforms in 2020. At CES, we also showed customer momentum for our Project Athena innovation program, including the first Project Athena-verified Chromebooks. Project Athena-verified laptops have been tuned, tested and verified to deliver fantastic system-level innovation and benefit spanning battery life, consistent responsiveness, instant wake, application compatibility and more. We verified 26 Project Athena designs to date and expect 50 more devices across Windows and Chrome to be verified this year. In addition to strengthening our largest businesses, we're investing to win key data-driven technology inflections. These inflections include the rise of artificial intelligence, the transformation of networks and emergence of the intelligent and autonomous edge. The market for AI-based silicon is growing and evolving quickly. New workloads are emerging, and existing workloads like high-performance computing are converging with AI. In 2019, we generated $3.8 billion in AI-based revenue. The AI market opportunity is expected to be $25 billion by 2024, and we're investing to lead with a strong portfolio of products. In addition to integrating AI into all our leading products, we've introduced and acquired new capabilities that deepen an already unparalleled portfolio of AI assets. We announced the acquisition of Habana Labs, a leading developer of programmable, deep learning accelerators for the data center. Habana, combined with Intel's existing AI ASICs and software expertise, will advance our AI offerings for the data center with high-performance training and inference processors and a standards-based programming environment to address evolving AI workloads. Delivering the optimal AI silicon architecture is critical but not sufficient to solve customers' problems. That's why we launched the oneAPI industry initiative to deliver a unified and simplified programming model for application development across heterogeneous processing architectures. oneAPI marks a game-changing evolution from today's limiting proprietary program approaches to an open standard space model for cross-architecture developer engagement and innovation. As expected, our networking business reached $5 billion in revenue in 2019. We've grown our business by helping our customers transform their networks by consolidating and virtualizing workloads on Intel Architecture-based servers. Now as we advance into the 5G era, we see our momentum and design win pipeline accelerating as we're positioned to win significant share in base stations. This quarter, we announced a strategic agreement with Alibaba to support both the Tokyo and Beijing Olympics, building out 5G infrastructure utilizing Xeon Scalable, Optane persistent memory and Intel software. These data-optimized 5G networks will support amazing experiences such as immersive 8K VR, cloud 3D stadium simulations and cloud broadcasting. We also delivered almost $5 billion in annual revenue from our IoT/Edge portfolio of products. In November, we disclosed our next-gen Movidius vision processing unit, Keem Bay. Keem Bay is highly optimized for edge inference with groundbreaking leaps forward in power-efficient performance, delivering up to 4x the performance or 6x the performance per watt over comparable competitive solutions. It's been over 2 years since the acquisition of Mobileye, and we couldn't be more excited about the team's progress. This quarter, we announced several exciting new engagements. We established an agreement for RAM data harvesting with SAIC Motor and embarked on a strategic partnership with NIO to deploy Mobileye's self-driving systems as the full stack solution for NIO's consumer AV. We also continued to accelerate the commercialization of driverless mobility as a service with 2 new partnerships, RATP in Paris and Daegu City in South Korea. In Q4, we were also excited to host analyst and investors at Mobileye's headquarters to discuss our strategy to win the more than $70 billion opportunity for ADAS, AV and data, and to expand our aspirations to an even larger role in the $160 billion opportunity for Mobility as a Service. Our guests had the chance to test drive our technology on the demanding roads of Jerusalem as we demonstrated industry's leading AV solution stack navigating a wide variety of driving complexities and delivering unmatched agility and safety. We have significant opportunities, but realizing them requires improved execution, starting with delivering more supply for our customers. In response to continued strong demand, we invested record levels of CapEx in 2018 and 2019. That added capacity allowed us to increase our second half 2019 PC CPU supply by double digits relative to the first half. However, demand has continued to outpace PC supply, and supply remains tight in our PC business. We're continuing to add capacity, so we're not constraining our customers' growth. Across our 14- and 10-nanometer nodes, we're adding 25% wafer capacity this year to deliver a high single-digit increase in PC unit volume. This will enable us to meet market demand, deliver our 2020 financial plan and increase inventory to more normalized levels. Our near-term challenge is working with our customers to support their desired product mix. Our process technology execution continues to improve. In Q4, we ramped our 10-nanometer production and continue to see yields improve. We are planning 9 new product releases on 10-nanometer this year, including our next-gen mobile CPU, a 5G base station SoC, an AI inference accelerator, our first discrete GPU and Xeon for server, storage and networking. We're also on track to deliver 10-nanometer plus this year, our first performance upgrade on 10-nanometer. Our 7-nanometer process remains on track to deliver our lead 7-nanometer product, Ponte Vecchio, at the end of 2021, with CPU products following shortly after in 2022. We are also driving innovation in the next generation of computing. At CES, we provided a first look at our next-gen Intel core mobile processor, code named Tiger Lake, which is designed to offer groundbreaking advancements when it ships later this year. Tiger Lake, built on Intel's 10-nanometer plus process, will deliver significant gains in compute, AI, graphics and interconnect over the prior generation. We will also deliver initial production shipments on our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake, in the latter part of 2020. We're also investing to lead the next wave of technology breakthroughs such as quantum computing. Our investment in quantum computing covers the full hardware and software stack in pursuit of a practical commercially viable quantum system. For example, last month, we unveiled a first of its kind cryogenic control chip, Horse Ridge, that will speed up development of full stack quantum computing systems. We made good progress this quarter but will continue to be laser-focused on improving our execution. That means delivering the supply, leadership process technology and product innovations that allow us to play a larger role in our customers' success. Our third priority is to thoughtfully deploy your capital to deliver attractive returns. That means, first, investing in the R&D and CapEx necessary to drive our long-term business plan. Since 2015, we have grown revenue by more than $16 billion while reducing spending by $500 million. Spending as a percentage of revenue is down 9 points, while over the same period we've increased R&D spending by $1.2 billion. We acquired Habana Labs, a fantastic company that will accelerate our AI plans, while also making thoughtful disinvestments. We closed both the 5G smartphone modem exit and the sale of IMFT in the quarter. We are confident in our future. And consistent with that, our Board has approved a 5% increase in our dividend to $1.32 per share. Last quarter, we announced a commitment to execute $20 billion in share repurchases over the next 15 to 18 months. And 3 months into that window, we've already repurchased $3.5 billion in shares. Finally, our role goes beyond delivering strong results to being a great corporate citizen that has real impact on the world around us and in the communities where we work. I'm proud of the many outside recognitions we've received for our responsible business practices. This reflects our culture and the efforts of our 100,000-plus employees around the world. Also, we continue to believe that a diverse workforce and inclusive culture are essential for executing our growth strategy, which is why we released detailed workforce representation data that raises the bar on ourselves and others for continued improvement. And it's important to us to be a leader in environmental sustainability, and we're investing to continue to increase the energy efficiency of our operations and our products. And we're also making significant progress on our goal of restoring 100% of our global water use by 2025. Back at our May Analyst Day, we told you that the industry was at an inflection point where the exponential growth of data is fueling massive expansion in multi-cloud environments, transforming networks and catalyzing the intelligent edge. We believe we're well positioned to lead this data revolution, and we expect to generate $85 billion in revenue and $6 in earnings per share in the next 3 to 4 years. 1 year into that plan, we are tracking well ahead of our commitment. We have $3 billion more revenue, and we've earned an additional $0.52 in earnings versus our May expectations. Our expectation is to continue to make deposits towards our multiyear goal every 90 days. In summary, our priorities are to accelerate growth, improve execution and thoughtfully deploy our capital on behalf of our owners like you. I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us and appreciate your continued support. I'll now hand the call over to George for details on our Q4 results and business outlook. George? Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 marked an outstanding finish to another record year, with $20.2 billion in revenue, up 8% year-on-year and $1 billion higher than guide. We saw record data-centric revenue of $10.2 billion, representing over 50% of our total revenue, an all-time high. DCG and Mobileye both achieved record revenue in the quarter. Q4 PC-centric revenue was $10 billion, up 2% year-on-year, capping CCG's fourth consecutive year of revenue growth. Q4 operating margin was approximately 36%, 2 points ahead of our guide on higher gross margin and spending leverage. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.1%, beating expectations due to strong flow-through of higher DCG revenue. Q4 EPS was $1.52, $0.28 above our guide, primarily due to strong operational performance and further boosted by gains from our ICAP Portfolio. These results demonstrate the strong demand for our leadership products and solid execution to achieve a record-breaking year. As a result, full year EPS of $4.87 was up 6% year-on-year. We generated $16.9 billion of free cash flow, up 19%, and returned $19.2 billion to shareholders. We anticipate another record year in 2020 and are raising the dividend by 5%. Moving to more details on Q4 performance. Operating margin of 36% in the quarter was up over 0.5 point versus last year as higher volume and ASP strength in our data-centric portfolio and lower spending were partly offset by the ramp of our 10-nanometer process and NAND pricing degradation. EPS was up 19% or $0.24 year-over-year on higher operating margin, equity gains driven by our ICAP Portfolio and a lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Our non-GAAP tax rate in Q4 was 13.6%, in line with expectations, and up 5 points year-over-year due to tax benefits from tax reform and discrete items in Q4 '18. Through to segment performance. Our Data Center Group had record revenue at $7.2 billion, up 19% from the prior year. These results beat our expectations, with platform volumes up 12% and platform ASPs up 5% year-over-year on strong cloud demand and continued adoption of our highest performance second-gen Xeon Scalable products. In Q4, cloud revenue was up 48% year-over-year as cloud service providers continue building capacity to serve customer demand. Enterprise and government revenue was down 7%, while communications service providers revenue grew 14% as customers continue to adopt IA-based solutions to transform their networks and transition to the 5G era. All 3 segments exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Our other data-centric businesses were up 6% year-over-year in Q4. IOTG achieved another double-digit growth quarter, with revenue up 13% and operating income up 29% year-over-year as customers increasingly adopt Intel AI-infused products to power the growing intelligent edge. And Mobileye revenue and operating income were up 31% and 54%, respectively, driven by the industry-leading EyeQ products, which offer unmatched computer vision and mapping capabilities and continue to win in a fast-growing ADAS market. EyeQ revenue was up 41% year-over-year. NSG revenue grew 10% on continued bit growth, partially offset by year-over-year pricing declines. NSG reported an operating loss of $96 million as NAND cost improvements were more than offset by pricing declines. PSG revenue declined 17% year-over-year on softness in the embedded segment primarily driven by lower last-time buys versus Q4 '18, partially offset by strength in wireless. Operating income was down 48% on lower revenue and segment product mix. CCG revenue was $10 billion in the fourth quarter, up 2% year-over-year, driven by higher PC and modem volumes. PC unit volumes were up 1% on continued market strength and increased capacity. Adjacencies, which include modems and wireless and wired connectivity solutions, grew 13% year-over-year driven by strong demand for modems and a better mix of connectivity solutions. Operating margin was 41%, up 4 points year-on-year on higher revenue and lower spending driven by the 5G smartphone modem exit. As a result, CCG achieved record operating income in 2019. In 2019, we've generated $33.1 billion in operating cash flow and invested $16.2 billion in CapEx. We also returned 113% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During the quarter, we purchased 63 million shares at an average price of $55.32 per share. Total 2019 share repurchases were 272 million. And in 2020, we expect to turn in excess of 100% of free cash flow to shareholders under the $20 billion buyback program announced last quarter and the increased dividend announced today. Let's move to outlook. 2020 is expected to be another record year for the company. We are forecasting revenue of $73.5 billion and EPS of approximately $5. We expect our PC-centric business to be down low single digits year-over-year on a slightly down PC TAM. Within 2020, we expect to see a strong first half and a moderating second half dynamic due to lower modem revenue and expected lower PC TAM in the second half of 2020 as the Windows 10 commercial refresh matures. We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be up high single digits for the full year as we capitalize on the secular trends that Bob outlined. We are expecting an exceptionally strong Q1 as cloud customers continue to build capacity and adopt our highest-performing products. This would mark 3 quarters of strong cloud buildout, and we expect more modest capacity expansion for the remainder of the year as CSPs move to a digestion phase. We are also planning for an increasingly competitive environment as we move through the year. As a result of these dynamics, we expect total revenue to be more front-end loaded in the first half than we've seen historically. Gross margin is expected to be 59% for the year, down a point versus 2019 on both mix of products and the impact of 10-nanometer costs. Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $19 billion or 26% of revenue, down 1 point, resulting in a flat operating margin of approximately 33%. We expect 2020 CapEx of approximately $17 billion. More than half of which is comprised of investments in fab space and 7- and 5-nanometer equipment. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $16.5 billion as the flow-through from revenue growth and higher depreciation is offset by higher CapEx and rebuilding of critical product inventory back to more normal operating levels. Let's turn to Q1. We anticipate a particularly strong start to another record year, with Q1 revenue of $19 billion, up 18% year-over-year and well above normal seasonal patterns. This is being driven in particular by data-centric revenue growth expected to be above 25% year-over-year on continued cloud buildout and NAND bit growth. Our PC-centric business is also contributing and is expected to be up more than 10% year-over-year on continued PC market strength, additional supply and higher modem revenue. With strong top line growth and mix, we expect Q1 gross margin of approximately 61%, up 3 points year-over-year. Q1 operating margin is expected to be approximately 35%, up 7 points versus last year on higher gross margin and spending leverage on higher revenue. Tax rate is expected to be 13%, and EPS is expected to be $1.30, up 46% year-over-year. In summary, 2019 was Intel's best year ever, and we expect a strong start to 2020 on the way to another record year. With that, let me turn it back over to Trey. All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions)","Yes. Let me -- thanks, Ross. Let me start, George, and you can chime in. First, at the -- thank you for the compliment on our fourth quarter results. When we look at 2020 demand cycles, we kind of have 3 things going on that are -- that impact the first half to second half outlook. And George touched on a few of these. But first, at the macro level, the insatiable appetite for data and the processing resources that need to go to make that data relevant, those trends continue, and we feel very good about how we're positioned to capitalize on this increased demand. Second, the -- as you know, from a cloud perspective, which now is bigger and bigger part of our overall DCG revenue, we expect them to continue to benefit from the trajectories that I mentioned initially. At the same time, you'll remember from last year, our ability to predict the cloud -- the CSPs' purchasing and then kind of digestion patterns is relatively hard. So we look at first half to second half, Q1 will be the, in essence, the third quarter in a row of real strong consumption patterns from the cloud folks. So we know from history that at some point, they go into digestion mode and the buying patterns begin to slow down. And it doesn't impact medium- or long-term trends, but it does impact cyclical trends during the course of the year. And we've tried to, based on our past learnings, take that into account as much as we can. So hopefully, we're wrong. Hopefully, we're conservative. But at this stage of the game, that's kind of how we've looked at cloud purchases first half to the second half. The second thing, PC TAM, we think, is going to be flat to down a little bit this year. And the expectation is the first half will continue to be a Windows 10 refresh that George flagged, and we expect that to slow down in the second half. And then the third item is modem. It's -- as we go into the second half of the year, we expect modem volume to be lower as we phase out of that business, as smartphone modem moves to the 5G world. So those 3 things have us looking at the full year of kind of 2% growth. And inherent in that is we know we got a much more competitive environment. And our intention during the course of the year is to compete vigorously to protect our position while continuing to expand as compute moves further and further away from the cloud out to the network and to the edge. Yes. And I guess I would just add that we feel really good about the year overall. It's just going to be a little flatter in terms of the pattern and certainly than we saw last year and certainly different than our normal seasonal pattern, but good strength growth in all of the businesses really outside of the PC, which is going to -- is coming across some headwinds from TAM, but we still expect it to work on gaining back share in some areas where it's had difficulties in the past as we can start to provide more units. And one last comment, I apologize. But I think just on a year-over-year basis, the comps in the first half of '20 are going to be easier. And then after a very strong second half of '19, comps a bit tougher in the second half of the year. But net-net, we're -- as George shaped it up, we're looking for another record year in 2020. Thanks, Rob. Congratulations on the strong results and especially the buybacks. Nearly 10% of shares retired in the last 2 years. Question, Bob, on 10-nanometer. I saw in the slides, you mentioned 10-nanometer yields ahead, right, of expectations. And you mentioned 9 product releases on 10. Can you help put that in context, what does it imply in terms of the range of desktop and server SKUs? I think there is some speculation that maybe 10-nanometer might be a small node rather than a regular node. Or I guess, asked in a different way, what percentage of your sales do you expect to be on 10-nanometer this year and maybe even next year? Yes. Well, first, we continue to make real progress on yields on 10-nanometer, and that's been -- after all the challenges we've had, that's been kind of a consistent theme over the last 4 to 6 quarters just on yield for 10. So we feel very good exiting the year and coming into this year and where we are in yields. Second, in terms of the product road map, we have -- we launched Ice Lake for client in the fourth quarter. We launched FPGA's Agilex products on 10-nanometer in the fourth quarter. And then through the course of this year, we're going to have successive products as AI inference accelerator, 5G SoC that we're really excited about for the 5G network GPU launched. And then last and certainly not least, bringing out Ice Lake server product at the back end of the year. So we've launched it. Yields are good. Designs across our portfolio of products are good, and we'll ramp them up during the course of the year. But primarily, in terms of volume, we'll still be -- the client business is the one we're going to ramp the fastest. It'll ramp during the course of the year. It'll be our second gen of 10-nanometer or what we'll call 10-plus in the second half of the year, which introduces a whole new level of performance for that product. But in the aggregate, we won't have a huge percentage of our overall company volume in the second half of the year. It'll grow as we exit the year and become a much bigger part of our overall volume in 2021. And then last, I'd just say that our intention back in May, and we reiterated again today, is that we want to get back to a 2- to 2.5-year cadence. And shortly after launching 10, our expectations is we'll have our first 7-nanometer product launched in the latter part of 2021 with CPUs to closely follow. So -- and ramping will go to 10-plus for clients, and we'll ramp 7 on a 2-year cadence in 2021. Congrats on the great results. Bob, maybe just following on that because I remember 2 quarters ago, you talked about Ice Lake taping out, for servers in the first half. And there's a lot of different milestones, it gets confusing. When you say second half, do you actually -- is that a volume ramp? Or is that when you actually expect the 10-nanometer servers to be out? Yes. It's a good question. Just a few things. I think, first, in terms of how we deploy the technology. Today, our ecosystem partners have already received Ice Lake server samples. So that's kind of the first step for us. And then what we indicated is we'll start production wafers in the first half of this year, and that'll translate into production of shipments in the latter part of 2020. So that's the sequence of events. So production -- we load wafers. We deliver samples, check. We load wafers, first half. We deliver production output, latter part of the year. So that's been pretty consistent with how we've been trying to ramp this over the last several quarters. And then just clarity on the client side, I'm surprised by the seasonality, but I guess I understand with Win 10. With that growth or the strong year-over-year you're seeing in Q1, are you still shorting the market, I guess? Yes. Yes. First, very -- we came into 2019 looking at kind of a flat PC TAM. And when all was said and done, we ended the year with about 3% growth overall and even stronger in the fourth quarter. So we've had a real strong -- the market has had a real strong year in 2019. At the end of the year, as we indicated, we were still constraining our PC customers. And there's -- I'd say there's -- we left some backlog on the table that we are quickly trying to fill as we come into the first quarter. So that's obviously a disappointment in terms of our serving customers at the end of the year but adds to volume in the first quarter, first half. As we go through the course of the year, just from a macro level, we spent record capital in '18; again, record capital in '19. As George laid out in his prepared remarks, we'll spend -- we'll have record capital in 2020. And it's really geared to ensure that we never constrain our customers' growth. And our expectations in 2020 is that we'll have high single-digit PC unit volume and against the market that we expect to be flat to down slightly. So we are going to be in a good position to meet customer -- the market demand in 2020 to deliver on our full year outlook and to begin to build the inventory levels to more natural position so that the mix dynamics of what product we're selling when we can manage the volatility in that much better than we have been able to in the fourth quarter. So supply constraints, we are maniacal about eliminating those so that we can meet customer demand and don't have to worry about it. And we'll expect to see more small core in the second half, which may be part of the dynamic, but we haven't really been able to serve that end of the market in the way that we would like to. So that may be part of what you're looking at. Yes. So as we -- let me just start with the full year because I think that'll be helpful. At the highest level, what you're really seeing is the -- an impact of -- largely related to 10-nanometer costs that are coming into the system during this year and increasing as we go into the second half for all the reasons that Bob laid out. We're actually getting some help that is moderating the impact of that from improving NAND pricing year-over-year. That's actually going to help us on gross margin and lower modem mix in -- particularly in the second half of the year but in the year overall. So those are the big drivers of modems, and that nets out to about a 1% reduction. And in Q1, what you're really seeing is lower modem and lower variable comp being the reason that we're moving up a point, say, from Q4. And so nothing unusual other than, normally, you would have expected to see a much bigger drop in Q1 gross margin because of the mix of products as it's the, obviously, the seasonally down quarter for many of our businesses. George, the only thing that I would add is we do -- inherent in our guide is our expectations for lower ASPs. And it's a function of 2 things: one that George mentioned, which is we will eliminate the supply constraints and begin to get more volume on small core, which, as you know, has lower ASPs; and secondly, we're anticipating a more competitive environment in the -- as we go through the course of the year. So to kind of bring it back, we're ramping 10. It's great. And we're ramping 10 in the second half of the year. And in parallel with that, we are investing in 7 in 2020 and in 2021. And those are the things that we flagged back in May at the Analyst Day. And I'd say the one thing that's really changed since then is that our yields on 10 are just a little bit better, and they're a contributor to slightly better gross margin in the second half of '19, and we expect that to be -- continue to be a contributor next -- this year, I should say. Yes. So the way we would look at DCG, I would say the growth rate will be modestly lower than the overall growth rate. You've got some very high growers contributing to pulling that up a little bit. So a little below the average but still attractive growth in the year. No, Stacy. Yes. No, I hear your point. One of the things that we mentioned is we are going to be producing in order to build inventory levels back up in the year. And so in the second half of the year, we would expect to be able to bring both our server products and most importantly, our PC products back to a more normalized inventory level. So we are -- being up in the high single digits is meant to allow us to not only satisfy our customers but also rebuild the inventory. So your math is correct. It'll be our own inventories. And then we'll have to see -- if you look at the -- some of the channel information, you might see customers trying to build some inventory as well. But when we're talking about building inventories, it's our inventory levels. I'd also say the channel inventories exiting the year for PC, I'd say, are relatively low. And that's on us. So I do expect, during the course of the year, we will build our inventory levels to more deal with spikes in demand. But at the same time, we expect the channel to be at more healthy levels as we exit 2020 and enter 2021. And then just the one other thing I'd mention is as we think about the business overall and kind of the demand signals, we continue to make really good progress on the comms sector, particularly with the growth in the network and the role that we play in the transition to 5G, and we characterize as the intelligent edge. We've delivered double-digit growth with IoT for the last several years. And network and IoT are bigger and bigger parts of our business that we think we're very well positioned. So when you think about PC volume up or down over time, we got this bigger growing aspect of our business that places demand on our manufacturing footprint. So that's the only other thing that I would add, Stacy. I guess going back to the PC constraints that you're seeing. So you'd like to build your inventory back up in, I think, you said earlier in the year, but it seems like we're just a few weeks from you going out to customers and telling them that you would be short. So at what point can they start to add inventory? Are you forecasting that would happen in the second half, in the first half? And then do you feel like when those constraints are eased that you'll be able to take back unit share on the client side? Yes. I think, first, it was middle of November, I should say, that we went out, and we want to be able to provide as much advance notice to our customer base as possible if supply is going to constrain their ability to grow to give them time to deal with it. And in November, with strong data center growth, PC demand continuing to grow and a factory excursion, combination of those things, we felt it was very important to get out to our customers as soon as possible. I think as we close the year, one of the favorable things was we got more output from our factories. And because of the capacity we put in place in '18, '19 and going into '20, we're really beginning to build back the capacity to meet the demand. So our expectations are we'll have sufficient supply in the first quarter, or I should say, sufficient supply throughout the year. I think our challenge is really going to be on 2 things, particularly in Q2 with PCs, and that is linearity, not just the supply in the quarter, but week on week supply as our customers are hoping for. And then second, particular SKUs or product mix, making sure that we have the right product mix. So we'll have enough capacity. I think Q2 will be a little challenging as we try to deal with product mix and linearity. But overall, we really plan to be out of the supply-constrained environment in 2020. Okay. And then are the shortages anywhere other than client? Is it entirely client? Are there any -- anything in server or any other products? No. We're in pretty good shape on server. And I think that going with 19% growth in fourth quarter depleted our inventory level. So we're not -- you have that kind of spike in demand. We're not perfect across all products or all SKUs. But server CPUs, we really prioritize that and try to put ourselves in a position where we're not constrained, and we're in pretty good shape. Pretty great shape, macro, micro, a few challenges here and there, but server CPU supply is pretty good. Sure. Why don't -- maybe I'll take CapEx, and Bob, you can cover the outsourcing piece. The -- so on CapEx, we're -- part of the reason we're at -- expecting $17 billion this year is we're building more space, some of the longer lead time items. One of the things that's really impacted us in terms of closing the gap on customer demand and our ability to support it has been not enough space available to fill with equipment, which you can do in a much shorter time frame if you already have a space in place. So we said over half is going to be for space. And then for 7- and 5-nanometer equipment, as you know, we've got all 3 nodes right on top of each other. And so we're going to be perhaps a little less capital efficient when you combine that with the fact that we are trying to close the gap on meeting our customers' requirements. And I think all of those things add to the $17 billion. But we also -- we're building for the future to make sure we have the kind of capacity, shelf space in place where we can quickly add capacity to meet demand, if necessary. Yes. And just on the -- the one other thing is maybe with the exception of litho, the reuse from 1 node to the next is still relatively high. So what we put in place for a 10 or a 7, for the most part, we can continue to reuse those tools for next generation. On the second part of your question, we've historically leveraged third-party foundries for a long time. And it's always been in the probably 20% to 25% of our overall supply we get from third-party foundries. And we continue to look at -- particularly in the non-IA, non-CPU products, we continue to evaluate where is -- in a capital-intense business, where is the best place to have these things manufactured. That's an ongoing process. And I would say, all else equal, the broader -- the breadth of our portfolio as we play a larger and larger role in our customers' success, we build more products. And with that, the evaluation of what we do inside and what we do outside is a full-time effort at our end. So we'll continue to do it. We'll continue to prioritize where we can get the best, most efficient output and make those decisions over time. Yes. Tim, let me just kind of correct the history just a little bit. What we said over the last couple of quarters was, when the question was, hey, when we look at 58%, which is what we quoted for Q4, does that mean -- is that the number that we should be expecting for 2020 and also with the 57% on the table for '21, is that where we are? And I said we will be closer to 60% than we will be to either of those numbers. And so 59% is very much in line with what we believe we were guiding. So I don't really feel like we're down a point. But clearly, there -- the factors that we talked about, everything from product mix to 10-nanometer mix, those are all things that are having an effect, particularly as the year plays out, and also the shape of the year. Bob talked about some of the things where we're -- we'll be in -- the mix in the first half is going to be much richer than we would normally have seen, and we may see a little less rich mix in the second half. So I think really nothing more than those type of movements, which are very much in line with what we were thinking we would see this year. Maybe -- Trey, maybe just to wrap. First, thanks for joining us. We feel great about how we wrapped up the year, our best quarter in the company's history, 2019, the best year in our company's history, and our outlook for 2020 is it'll -- is we'll do it again. We expect it to be another record year. And our ambitions have just never been greater. As you know, we're going after a larger TAM. We're expanding the role that we play in our customers' success. We're leveraging our CPU architecture but also evolving beyond the CPU to GPUs and visual processing units as workloads continue to evolve. And given the overall dynamics of the industry, we feel very good about where we stand and we realize it's an increasingly competitive world, and we feel like we're well positioned to deal with it. So thanks again for joining us. Our focus is on obsessing about how we serve our customers best. And if we -- and we expect to do that better and better, and that'll be what really drives the growth of the company. So thanks, and we look forward to another deposit 90 days from now.","Congrats on the strong end of last year and start to this year. George or Bob, whichever of you want to answer this, I want to go a little bit into the trajectory of revenues. George, you gave some great color there on the 2 different segments, PC-centric and data-centric. But it appears by the end of this year, you could even be going negative in both of those segments year-over-year. So it seems like it's a pretty significant drop. I appreciate conservatism in the end-of-life on the Windows side of things, but how do you factor in the increased competition that you mentioned and the fact that shortages should go away so you could actually have some market share gains? Let me add my congratulations to the solid results. I guess I've got a similar question to Ross' first question on revenue, but mine is going to be on gross margin. If you just sort of look at the Q1 guide of 61% versus the full year of 59%, I'm just trying to understand kind of the puts and takes that brings gross margin down throughout the year. And explicitly, how much of this is kind of you guys baking in some increased competition? Or how much of this is a pull forward of 7-nanometer? Because 59% is pretty close to what you talked about at the Analyst Day, kind of flattish year-on-year, but it is slightly lower, and you were pretty explicit about gross margins going down in calendar year '21. I'm just kind of curious as to whether or not we're getting a pull forward of the 7 here? Or what are the puts and takes as you think about gross margin throughout the year? On the full year guide for data-centric, up high single digits. I appreciate the first half, second half profile on DCG. But how are you guys thinking about growth of DCG within that framework for the full year? Is it in line with the sort of high single-digits growth for data-centric? And then within that framework, how do you see the growth trends in other DCG segments, i.e., enterprise and comms service provider? I wanted to ask a bit about the capacity additions. So I kind of get this, adding 25% wafer capacity to support your own volumes, going up high single digits in a market that you think is down. Does that imply that you're actually going to be over shipping the market this year as you sort of rebuild those channel inventories? And what does that imply if I'm going forward into 2021 where the PC market itself may still be in decline, and you'll be -- you'll have higher capacity and ideally like die shrink at that point? Like how do we think about that? Right. So that's your own inventory? Or inventory in the channel? Are you going to be selling that to the customers or keeping it on your books? On CapEx, specifically, $17 billion, you mentioned some of the parts there, but how do we divide that between kind of 7 and 5 versus what you're doing with 10? And I don't know if you're still adding some 14 even. And as we think about CapEx moving forward and capacity here, how do you guys feel about outsourcing non-CPU products like, for example, PSG, could you outsource that to foundries, how are you thinking about CapEx going forward? Jonathan, I think we have time for one more question, and then we'll turn the call back over to Bob to wrap things up. George, I wanted to go back to gross margin. I think last quarter, we were talking about 60% for this year, and we're now 59% for the year on a little bit better revenue. And yes, it's only 100 basis points less. But obviously, people are concerned about the competitive environment. So can you just talk specifically to what changed? And maybe as you exit the year, it looks like that number has to be in the 57%, 57.5% range, which is about where you said next year would be, 2021. So is that still the right number for next year, too? Thanks, Bob and George, and thank you all for joining us today. Operator, can you please go ahead and wrap up the call?

INTC,Q2 2020,3654,2717,1465,"Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's second quarter earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for this joining us online. I'm joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me hand it over to Bob. Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. Amid a very challenging environment, cloud and network infrastructure and PC capabilities have been vital in allowing businesses and people to continue to work, learn, stay connected and provide critical goods and services. Those trends contributed to a very strong quarter in which we generated $19.7 billion in revenue and delivered $1.23 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $1.2 billion on the top line and $0.13 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and drove approximately 52% of the company's revenue, and our PC-centric businesses grew 7%. I continue to be amazed by our employees and supply chain partners who have diligently worked to keep our business operating at a high level during this unprecedented challenge. COVID-19 has driven redesigned workflows and added additional environmental stress that I know has strained employees and ecosystem partners as they try to maintain productivity in this new world. I want to thank our employees and partners for their incredible contributions. Our primary focus continues to be ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce, delivering for our customers and helping the communities in which we operate. On each earnings call, I give updates about our progress against 3 key priorities: accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Let me give you a few thoughts on each. We're transforming the company to accelerate growth. That means not just playing defense but position our business to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We've built scale businesses indexed to key technology inflections such as cloud, AI, 5G and the intelligent and autonomous edge. We see a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals, our factories and now even our schools. In this new world, our opportunity set becomes more than just the CPU. It's more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so we can have a larger impact on our customers' success. That diversity is one critical factor in driving today's results. I'll highlight a few examples from the last 90 days. AI use cases are becoming pervasive, and we are embedding AI capability into all our products. Our Xeon platform is foundational for data center AI with value, scalability, built-in AI acceleration and inference leadership. This quarter, we launched our third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Cooper Lake, which is the first mainstream server CPU, bfloat16 support, which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for the same accuracy. Developers can use and test latest Intel optimized versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16 and the Intel distribution of OpenVINO to deploy optimized inference from cloud to edge. In Q2, both our cloud and comms service provider businesses grew more than 40% year-over-year as critical cloud-delivered applications continued to scale and 5G build-outs accelerated. Leading cloud service providers, including Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook and Tencent, announced they are adopting our third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure and services. Also this quarter, Azure introduced several new Xeon Scalable instances, including general purpose and memory optimized Azure virtual machines. We were also excited to be part of an industry first with Rakuten's full-scale commercial launch of its mobile carrier service. This service is the world's first end-to-end, fully virtualized, cloud native mobile network, and it's powered by Intel processors and FPGAs from the radio access network to the 5G-ready mobile core. Compute capabilities are moving from the cloud to the edge and catalyzing a vast array of new usages and market opportunities. The largest opportunity we see at the edge is the $230 billion 2030 TAM for ADAS, data and Mobility-as-a-Service technologies. Since the last call, we acquired Moovit, a leading Mobility-as-a-Service solution company. Combining Mobileye's market-leading ADAS and AD technologies with Moovit accelerates our ability to become a full-stack mobility provider and truly revolutionize transportation. The most important demonstration of the power of our technologies is the commitment of our customers, and we are excited this week to announce a significant design win with Ford. Design win to date in 2020 include multiple new ADAS production programs, representing cumulative volume of over 20 million units. We're also driving incredible innovation for our customers across a wide spectrum of PC use cases. This quarter, we introduced 3 new additions to our 10th gen processor family, extending our leadership in gaming and business. The Core S- and H-series processors for desktop and mobile gaming deliver speeds out of the box reaching up to 5.3 gigahertz, making them the world's fastest gaming processors; and our new 10th-gen Intel Core vPRO processors deliver uncompromised productivity and hardware-based security for commercial PCs. Q2 also marked the launch of Lakefield, featuring our new Intel hybrid technology, which is a hybrid CPU architecture for power and performance scalability. We also continue to work on improving our execution. Intel employees and our supply chain partners have role modeled teamwork in navigating difficult conditions while working to support customer upsides during the crisis. We have made significant progress in increasing our capacity and improving our supply while delivering $2 billion above our plans through the first 6 months of the year. We're on track to return to more normal levels of PC inventory as we work through the second half of the year. Acceleration of our next-generation products continues. We now expect to increase our 10-nanometer-based product shipments for the year by more than 20% versus our January expectations. Customer demand for our family of 10-nanometer-based SoCs for 5G base station designs is also very strong. We delivered a full node of performance improvement within our 14-nanometer-based products by optimizing our product and process together, and the power of our intra-node improvements continues with our next-generation 10-nanometer-based client product, Tiger Lake. Tiger Lake delivers breakthrough performance in CPU, graphics and AI, and we'll be shipping to customers in a matter of weeks. We are also targeting initial production shipments for our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake, for the end of the year. And we have a pipeline of exciting new product architectures for 2021 led by Alder Lake for client and Sapphire Rapids for server. Both products will start initial production shipments in the second half of '21. Let me provide some updates on our technology road map. We continue to demonstrate proof points of our breakthrough advanced packaging technologies. Our Lakefield product, which I mentioned earlier, delivers scale production of our 3D packaging technology, Foveros, combining both 10-nanometer and 22-nanometer capabilities in a disaggregated architecture. This quarter also marked a significant milestone in our data center GPU technology. We successfully powered a petaflop scale GPU with high bandwidth memory, using our advanced embedded multi-die interconnect bridge, or EMIB, 2D packaging technology. Turning to our 7-nanometer technology. We are seeing an approximate 6-month shift in our 7-nanometer-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7-nanometer process, which, based on recent data, is now trending approximately 12 months behind our internal target. We have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation. We've root caused the issue, and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks. But we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty. We're mitigating the impact of the process delay on our product schedules by leveraging improvements in design methodology such as die disaggregation and advanced packaging. We have learned from the challenges in our 10-nanometer transition and have a milestone-driven approach to ensure our product competitiveness is not impacted by our process technology road map. Our overarching priority is to deliver product leadership for our customers, and we are taking the right steps to produce a strong lineup of leadership products. We will continue to invest in our future process technology road map, but we will be pragmatic and objective in deploying the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be on our process, external foundry process or a combination of both. Our advanced packaging technologies, combined with our disaggregated architecture, give us tremendous flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, our data center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, will now be released in late 2021 or early 2022, utilizing external and internal process technologies, combined with our world-leading packaging technologies. We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer product, a client CPU, in late '22 or early '23. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process road map, including the holiday refresh window of 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer data center CPU design in the first half of '23. Finally, while process technology is very important, it is only one of the 6 technology pillars of innovation that drive differentiation in our products. You will hear more about advances across all 6 technology pillars: process, packaging, architecture, memory, interconnect and security/software at the upcoming Intel Architecture Day. Last, we are focused on the thoughtful allocation of your capital. We are investing to grow our capabilities even as we deliver significant free cash flow this year. Since 2015, we have grown R&D spending by more than $1 billion while divesting noncore assets and reducing overall spending as a percentage of revenue by 9 points. We also look for opportunities to augment our product lines and speed the pace at which we can grow the company. As discussed earlier, we acquired Moovit this quarter, investing approximately $900 million to dramatically accelerate our capability to capitalize on the $160 billion Mobility-as-a-Service opportunity. We also announced a $250 million investment in Jio Platforms, a high-speed wireless connectivity and digital services provider, to help fuel digital transformation in India. Our purpose to deliver world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on Earth has never been more essential, but the global problems we face are bigger than any one company can solve alone. That's why we established 2030 corporate responsibility goals, which call for a collective response to revolutionize health and safety, make technology fully inclusive and help address climate change. We've also committed more than $50 million and extended our expertise, global reach and influence to combat COVID-19 as well as social injustice. The early results of our pandemic response technology initiative, which we announced earlier this week, underscore Intel's unique ability to partner and collectively solve critical problems. In closing, I want to thank all our employees who are working through this challenging time to deliver our purpose and support our customers. Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. The atypical seasonal effects of COVID-related demand for mobility products and data center infrastructure continued in Q2, resulting in record Q2 revenue for CCG, DCG and memory. Revenue came in at $19.7 billion, up 20% year-on-year, and $1.2 billion higher than guide. Data-centric revenue of $10.2 billion, up 34% year-on-year, represented 52% of our total revenue, an all-time high. Strong demand for NAND and 5G networking solutions and richer server mix drove most of the upside versus our expectations. Q2 PC-centric revenue was $9.5 billion, up 7% year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales enabled through increased manufacturing supply on capacity additions over the past year. Gross margin for the quarter was 55%, slightly below expectations, on higher product costs from faster uptake of our 5G ASIC products, which are margin dilutive relative to the company average, and also continued acceleration of 10-nanometer products overall, partially offset by a shift of costs from cost of sales to R&D related to 7-nanometer product timing. As a reminder, we expected an approximate 3-point reduction in gross margin in the second quarter on the effect of pre-PRQ reserves for our Tiger Lake client product. This is largely a timing item with respect to the full year as we benefit from the $0 units in our initial sales of product, which will begin this quarter. Operating margin of 31% in the quarter was approximately flat versus last year as spending efficiency offset lower gross margin. Q2 EPS was $1.23, $0.13 above our guide as stronger-than-expected operating results from notebook, memory and a richer mix of server products, along with higher gains in our trading asset portfolios, offset increased costs from our 10-nanometer acceleration and the effects of a discrete foreign tax item. In Q2, we generated $11.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $3.4 billion in CapEx, with $7.7 billion of free cash flow up 92% year-over-year. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders via dividends. As a reminder, we paused our share repurchase program in Q1 as we felt it was prudent to do so in the current economic environment. We expect to complete the balance of our $20 billion share repurchase program and return to our historical capital return practices when market dynamics stabilize. Moving to segment performance in Q2. Data Center Group revenue of $7.1 billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations, with strength across our customer segments. Year-over-year platform volumes and ASPs were up 29% and 5%, respectively. DCG adjacencies also delivered significant growth with revenue up 118% year-on-year on strong adoption of 5G networking solutions. While year-over-year comparisons for DCG benefited from a weaker Q2 '19, revenue in the quarter came in at the second highest level ever for DCG and the highest revenue ever in our cloud business. Revenue year-over-year was up 47% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government and 44% for communications service providers. Operating margin was 44%, up 8% year-on-year on higher revenue and high-end compute mix. We see increased competition this year, but we've also seen strong customer response to our product portfolio and now expect to end the year with market share that is somewhat higher than our original expectations. Our other data-centric businesses were up 14% year-over-year, primarily on the NAND dynamics in Q2, despite significant COVID headwinds impacting demand in our more GDP-sensitive businesses, IOTG and Mobileye. IOTG revenue and operating income declined 32% and 76%, respectively, primarily on lower revenue from industrial, retail and vision segments. Mobileye revenue was down 27%, and operating income turned to a modest loss as the decline in global auto sales more than offset continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches. NSG's record quarterly revenue of approximately $1.7 billion was up 76% year-on-year on strong NAND bit growth and improved pricing. Q2 was an all-time record for quarterly revenue for our memory business. The business also returned to profitability this quarter, generating approximately $300 million in operating income. PSG revenue grew 2% year-over-year on cloud strength, which was partially offset by weaker demand from embedded and communications segments. Operating income was up 54% on richer product mix and improved unit cost. CCG revenue was $9.5 billion in Q2, up 7% year-over-year, driven by notebook demand and higher modem and WiFi sales, which more than offset lower desktop volumes. PC unit volumes were up 2% year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply. We expect our share to improve throughout the remainder of the year as we begin to recover unit share in notebooks, utilizing our smaller core products which we have not been able to fully serve given the strength of demand for our large core products. Operating margin was 30%, down 12 points year-on-year as higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products and the pre-PRQ reserves ahead of our Q3 Tiger Lake launch more than offset the benefits of higher revenue. Moving now to our third quarter outlook. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect continued strength in cloud and comms infrastructure and consumer notebook PCs in Q3, but we expect that the weak economic environment will impact our commercial PC business, particularly the desktop form factor, and also drive lower demand for the enterprise and government segment in DCG and in IOTG and Mobileye. As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.2 billion, with PC-centric and data-centric businesses down mid-single digits year-over-year. In Q3, we expect the PC TAM to be down high single digits year-over-year on OEM inventory drawdown, softer desktop demand and the effects of the global recession. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%, down 3.5 points year-over-year as the accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products and lower platform revenue more than offset NAND margin improvement. We are expecting a tax rate of approximately 15.5% in Q3. This is approximately 2 to 2.5 points above our previous expectations, primarily due to a lower FDII benefit in the year, a temporary reduction in R&D tax credits in California and the effect of a pushout of a foreign grant. The higher tax rate is reducing our EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.03 versus our prior rate expectations. As a result, Q3 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share. Moving to full year. We are providing full year guidance, although visibility remains somewhat limited into the fourth quarter. Still, we do expect some part of the company's first half outperformance will be additive to our estimate for full year revenue. We are now forecasting revenue of $75 billion and EPS of approximately $4.85. We expect our PC-centric business to be flat to slightly down against the PC TAM that is down mid-single digits year-over-year. Following a very strong first half of the year, we expect demand trends to moderate in the second half as weaker global GDP and the maturing Win 10 commercial refresh drive a lower PC TAM. Again, we also expect to increase our market segment share as we have greater supply for entry PC designs. Additionally, we are forecasting lower modem revenue in the second half. We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be up approximately 10% for the full year on strong cloud demand and increased 5G build-outs. After significant cloud expansion in the first half and into Q3, we expect capacity expansion to moderate as CSPs move to a digestion phase. We are also planning for an increasingly competitive environment as we move into the second half. We expect continued global GDP-related impacts to our IOTG and Mobileye businesses in the second half of the year. Overall, our implied first half/second half revenue contribution is an anomalous 53% to 47% as opposed to a more typical year with underserved seasonal volume patterns of 46% and 54%, respectively. Gross margin is expected to be 58% for the year, down 1 point versus our original expectations for the year and 2 points lower year-over-year. This change is being largely driven by higher costs from higher-than-expected demand for our 10-nanometer products and the pushout of a government grant for our memory business. These effects, coupled with softness in our IoT businesses, more than offset the stronger overall demand, improved mix in DCG and the shift in some spending between OpEx and cost of sales related to the product timing delays Bob discussed earlier. Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $19.7 billion or 26% of revenue, down 1 point year-on-year. Full year spending is up versus our January expectations on higher R&D expenditures, including the previously discussed shift between OpEx and cost of sales and costs related to COVID, partially offsetting the cost reductions on the modem exit and other portfolio actions as well as ongoing SG&A productivity gains. The resulting operating margin is 32%, down 1 point year-over-year the tax rate is expected to be 14.5%, reflecting the impact of discrete items and the lower FDII benefit. Full year EPS of $4.85 is $0.15 below our January expectations as increased server and notebook PC demand and slightly higher equity gains are more than offset by COVID-related impacts to IOTG and Mobileye, higher product costs from accelerating 10 nanometer, a higher tax rate and the impacts of improving our liquidity by raising additional debt and temporarily pausing our share buyback. The combination of our liquidity actions and the higher tax rate alone impact full year EPS by more than $0.15. We expect 2020 CapEx of approximately $15 billion and free cash flow of approximately $17.5 billion. To conclude, I'd like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide. Very much appreciate the hard work of our employees and contractors who delivered excellent results in the face of a very difficult environment. With that, I'll hand it back to Trey, and we'll get to your questions. All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.","I wanted to dig into the competitive and the financial implications of the 7-nanometer delays that, Bob, you mentioned. So on the competitive side, by the time you come out with 7, TSMC is planning to be on the 3-nanometer node so will still be a generation ahead. So what's the market share implication of that? And then related, on the financial side, what's the CapEx and gross margin implications and even pricing implications if you stay on 10-nanometer longer next year? And I guess the bigger question that a lot of investors would have is, at what point Intel should just consider outsourcing a lot more to foundries so that you can keep in line with the state-of-the-art and manufacturing technology? Vivek, let me just comment on your question around what we're going to see -- what we might see next year. Next year is still going to be as it was when we talked about it last in May of '19, still going to be largely a 10-nanometer with some 14-nanometer year. And the dynamics there are as we're coming into it with having moved a little bit further along the yield curve, as we've seen more demand for 10-nanometer products in 2020 than we had expected. So we're not going to update '21 at this time, but I think we're more concerned about what the global economy is doing than where we are on 10-nanometer. Well, I think the first part of your question, in the -- with 2022 being, in essence, a full array of 10-nanometer products, the expectation is, all else equal, a little more 10-nanometer spend and less 7-nanometer spend, provided we decide to continue to do all of our production inside. In the event we decide that we're going to leverage third-party foundries more effectively, we would have a little more 10 and a lot less 7. And that's kind of the optionality that we've tried to build in as we evaluate the future of Moore's Law, invest in technology development leadership. In the event we're not there and there's a better alternative, be prepared to take advantage of it. Thanks, John. I mean, first, product schedule slippage of roughly 2 quarters, while process we expect now to be roughly 4 quarters. The difference of the gap is driven by a couple of things: one, a buffer in our planning process between process and products to make sure that we don't -- minimal disruption on customers because of process; second, as I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, die disaggregation and advanced packaging gives us the ability for a given SoC to do some stuff inside and some stuff outside and, therefore, further compress the product delivery in light of process slippage. So that's why we've been able to be confident in a 6-month product ship slip, even though process was moving out 12 months. In terms of -- I think your second question was about we've seen this movie before, maybe. And I think the importance of our many lessons coming out of 10-nanometer, one of them was how do we ensure that we have contingency plans in the event that our advancements in process technology, as it gets increasingly complicated, do not play out the way we'd hope, how do we make sure that we can continue to deliver leadership products for our customers on that annual cadence. So I'm sure things won't play out exactly the way we want. We think we've dialed in 7. But at the same time, what's different is we're going to be pretty pragmatic about if and when we should be making stuff inside or making outside and making sure that we have optionality to build internally, mix and match inside and outside or go outside in its entirety if we need to. And that's kind of one of our learnings coming out of 10 is, in the event process doesn't move along as we expect, let's make absolutely sure, with advanced contingency planning and real milestones, that we can glitch the best we can to leverage somebody else and not slip product schedules in light of process complexities. Let me -- maybe I'll flip those around. Over the last couple of years, we've been talking about, as we expand our capacity, evaluating more holistically when do we use third-party foundries rather than do everything ourselves. And we call that engaging in the ecosystem in much more holistic ways for a variety of different reasons, so we don't have to build everything ourselves as the capital associated with each node becomes a bit higher. So in general, I would say, for planning purposes, we've been engaging with the ecosystem much more. And all else equal, I would expect that roughly 20% to be a little bit higher as we focus on growing the business. Your first question in terms of planning then, we have -- we feel like we have a real solid product road map, again, for the second half of this year, for '21 and for '22, and that we'll do it on our existing 10-nanometer that's ramping faster than we expected. It yields in line with what we expected. So for the near term, we think we got a great lineup of products, and we expect to fight and protect our share while expanding the role we play in a variety of different places in the industry. But now is when we're planning for '22, '23. And we are evaluating now -- in light of where we are, where we think the industry, the competition of third parties are, evaluating now what's the best option for us to make sure that we can deliver an annual cadence of product leadership for our customers. And those decisions are not decisions that we'll make in 2023. Those decisions based on the information that we have along the way will be made long before then, whether it's decisions about how much capacity we need to put in place or decisions about how do we leverage more effectively somebody else's process capabilities and factories so that we can get real good incremental returns on capital deployed. Yes. Stacy, this is George. Maybe I'll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year because it's clearly -- it's having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we're growing faster than we expected in 2020. And we're -- part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and, I would say, on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we had forecasted for the year. So it's why you're seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It's a positive growth story in that, again, we're seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer products. It's the demand for 10-nanometer products within the mix of our overall revenue, Stacy. Well, I think I'd start with our full year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue. So that's... Let me just finish, Stacy. I think it's a good question, but maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So full year demand for the company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer we've kind of set are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first 6 months, and we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, that the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year. And as we accelerate 10 faster, because customers are banding it more, the implications are that our margins, all else equal, will be lower. George kind of highlighted those were the primary drivers of the 1 point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster, and our 5G comms business and the Data Center Group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated. I put that -- I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category. We feel -- we know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think, is a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield. If it's more of our growth than we had anticipated, all else equal, margins will be a little bit lower. And that's kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we're ramping as we -- ramping yields as we expected with more volume, all else equal, will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year. Thank you. Yes. On the -- on Ponte Vecchio, originally, the architecture of Ponte Vecchio includes an I/O-based die connectivity, a GPU and some memory tiles, all kind of packaged together. That's kind of the design of Ponte Vecchio. From the beginning, we would do some of those tiles inside and some of those tiles outside and again leverage the packaging technology as a proof point of how do we mix and match different designs into one package. So that was the design from the beginning. And again, when we talk about disaggregation, more flexibility, optionality in our designs, use some stuff inside, some stuff outside, Ponte Vecchio was really -- Ponte Vecchio on the data center side and Lakefield on the client side were kind of our test products, both the -- one of which we've launched; the other one, which is in development. So that design disaggregation gives us lots of flexibility. As we go forward now, we can think about whether we introduce Ponte Vecchio with -- I think I said some of those tiles are inside and outside from the beginning. Now as we go forward, we can assess whether we swap out one of our tiles for a third-party foundry or not. Again, that's the beauty and the value of this change in design methodology that gives us much more optionality and flexibility. So in the event there's a process slip, we can buy something rather than make it all ourselves. And with respect to the long-term outlook, first off, our long-term margin outlook is not 57%. We've talked about it being well above that over time. But in terms of -- as we dynamically move -- potentially move product depending on where it is best provided, I think that certainly gives us more flexibility to optimize our capital spend, get a higher return on that capital spend. And it should be accretive to free cash flow. So we talked a little bit about that actually back in May of '19 that embracing the ecosystem and balancing some of our activity externally is going to be important as we look to improving returns over time. Yes. As you look at the data-centric revenue, we'll see a number of factors at play. Obviously, year-over-year, you're going to see the impact of the falloff in IoT and in Mobileye. But what we're seeing in the data-centric -- or the DCG side is we think we peaked on cloud in the second quarter, and it was an all-time record, so not a bad peak. We've probably peaked back in Q4 of '19 on enterprise and government. And while it was reasonably strong in Q1, it's -- you can see it coming down over the next few quarters. It may have -- it often has a little bit of a bounce in Q4, we'll have to see. And our comms provider, I would say, we expect Q2 to have been a peak there, and that'll start rolling off from there. So everything on the DCG side has got a step-down from a very strong Q2 and probably continues down on cloud and comms as our current outlook. Does that help? Yes. We expected, based on the competition's product road map, that we would see increasing competition in the second half of this year. We also thought -- we've been a little bit pleasantly surprised in the strength of our -- the demand for our products in the first half of the year, and it's continuing into the second half. So we don't think the impact will be quite as large competitively in the second half as we had thought. And as I said on PC, we think we're going to actually gain share. I would just say it's -- we had -- when we guided back in January, in the context of our guidance, we made that statement. So George is just reiterating that, that we see a more competitive world, and we'll be prepared to deal with it. And we've factored that into our outlook for the second half of the year. I think as I said on the last question that we have a reasonable view that spending is going to be coming down in the cloud and in enterprise and even comms off of very high levels, and we expect that to continue into Q4. And so again, I think when we look at the full year, stronger than expected. Overall, this is -- this would be -- in many ways, we're delighted to be as close to our forecast as we were given all of the things going on in the world. But again, we've seen very strong demand peaking for cloud in the third quarter -- excuse me, the second quarter; peaking for comms in the second quarter. And it's just going to be a period of a little bit of digestion as one would expect. Yes. Let me just kind of close out and end where we began. First, over the last couple of years, as you know, we've expanded our TAM in the quest to play a much larger role in our customers' success by investing in key leading technologies like 5G, AI and intelligence at the edge. And we feel pretty good about the investments that we've been making. And last year, we wrapped up our best year in the company's history, entering 2020. Obviously, this year has been an incredibly challenging year on multiple fronts. But at the same time, we expect '20 to be the best year in our company's history, our fifth record year in a row, delivering better results than we expected in January at a time when the market is worse than we expected. So competitively, we feel stronger as we exit 2020. Third point I'd make is our execution has improved. Capacity and supply is in place. We're ramping a slew of 10-nanometer products across our portfolio. We are ramping 10 faster than we had planned and we have a strong leadership -- a strong pipeline over the next several years. And we believe we can deliver another notable performance on 10-nanometer itself. Fourth point, at the same time, our 7-nanometer products will be delayed. We've pushed out the timing of the 7-nanometer node. But along the way, we have taken steps on die disaggregation, advanced packaging, deeper engagement with the ecosystem and contingency planning as a sign of strength, not as a sign of weakness, that gives us much more flexibility to make the decisions on where is the most effective way to build our products to deliver that annual cadence of leadership for our customers. And we feel pretty good about where we are, though we're not happy. I'm not pleased with our 7-nanometer process performance. But as we sit here today, 6 months through the year, our people are safe. We're delivering for our customers. The communities we operate in are better as a result of our presence and the passion of our employees for making a difference. And next 90 days from now, we'll talk more about our efforts to create world-changing technologies that continue to enrich the lives of every person on earth. So thanks for joining us, and we'll talk to you soon.","Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I mean, first, our primary focus is on ensuring that we're delivering leadership -- an annual cadence of leadership products each and every year for our customers in a predictable manner. So what we talked about today is a strong lineup for 2020, 2021, 2022 for both client and server. And we feel very good about that lineup. And our expectation on 10-nanometer, much like what we're able to do on 14-nanometer, is to get another node of performance within that -- within 10-nanometer in and of itself. So we feel very good about our product road map through 2022. That being said, as we think about that next-generation of products in late '22 and '23 and beyond, we need to make sure that we continue to deliver strong performance. And our priorities in the ideal world is leadership products on our process technology, so we capture the economic benefits of IDM. But the focus will be leadership products. So to the extent that we need to view somebody else's process technology, and we call those contingency plans, we will be prepared to do that. And if we do, there's lots of moving parts, but the economic implications in the event that we decide to move to somebody else's foundry, and with our scale, how do you get ASPs in line with our cost, continue to deliver leadership products so we capture attractive ASPs and to reduce the amount of capital that we have to deploy to build a foundry on an older node or on a last gen kind of process node. So in the aggregate, for the last couple of years, with the real focus on product leadership, we've been engaging with the ecosystem in a much more holistic way. We've been designing our products and advancing our packaging technology so that we have much more flexibility to decide if and when we will use our fabs or somebody else's to deliver that annual cadence of leadership products. We feel very good through '22 time frame, and now we're evaluating the optionality that we have on '23 and beyond. I guess a follow-up question on the 7-nanometer delay. I guess curious how should we think about the implications for CapEx and required capacity adds at 10-nanometer and 14-nanometer. And then just to circle back on the comment around contingency plans after '22, considering your first data center CPU will launch in first half '23, are you suggesting that, that could be found out and not be built internally at Intel? Sticking on the same topic of 7-nanometer. Bob, if you could just help me understand, yields are 12-month behind where you would expect them, but the product ramp is only 6. If you could square that circle, that would be helpful. But more importantly, you had multiple sort of pushouts of 10-nanometer. You're identifying this 7-nanometer pushout today. What confidence level do you have that this is sort of a one-and-done issue and it doesn't turn into a repeat of 10 where you kind of had multiple periods of pushouts? I'm going to stick with the theme and ask about the 7-nanometer as well. I guess, Bob, it's great to hear that you're being -- you're saying you're going to be more pragmatic about internal versus external. But it seems like contingency plan 3 years down the road is how the external option is being treated. I think investors are frustrated with how long the misexecution on the manufacturing has happened. Are there steps where, instead of being a contingency plan, you actually start making the external side the primary source before 2023, obviously, on the design side more than the revenue side? And maybe a follow-up. If 3 to 5 years down the road, the 20/80, 20 external, 80 internal mix, do you think that changes? I want to ask about the acceleration in 10-nanometer. Is this really because yields are getting better and there's higher demand or because you're trying to offset the 7-nanometer delay? Because it's hitting the margins big time, which doesn't really tie in my head to, like, yields getting hugely better versus where you thought they were going to be in January. So how do I think about the drivers of that 7-nanometer acceleration in light of the 7 -- or 10-nanometer acceleration in light of the 7-nanometer delay given what it's doing to the margins? But wait a minute, if I look at your annual guidance now versus where it was in the beginning of the year, it's higher, but it's actually lower in the second half versus what you had implied in -- when you first gave the annual guidance 6 months ago. How does that imply that demand is higher versus where you were now given you've actually lowered the second half? Yes, but you're just making it sound like where you can typically get to, is there... I wanted to ask also on the same manufacturing topic. So I think, Bob, when you were talking about Ponte Vecchio, I think you said that you're going to package it internally, but it seemed like you were implying an external foundry contingency even for this first GPU product. I guess my question is, did I read that right? And also, I wanted to ask, George, what the long-term implications are if you move to somebody else's fab? What does this do to your 57% to 63% long-term gross margin? And how does it impact free cash flow? I mean, obviously, it saves you on CapEx, but can it be accretive to free cash flow? I just wanted to ask about the data-centric revenue heading into Q3. The mid-single-digit decline year-over-year implies a pretty big decline from Q2. You helped a little bit on the call, but I'm wondering if you could help us better understand the reason for that big quarterly drop. And kind of as an aside, you also mentioned increased competition in DCG in the second half, and I'm just wondering what exactly you're referring to on that side. Okay. Yes. That's helpful. And then the comment on increased competition in DCG in second half. Operator, I think we have time for one more question, and then we'll turn the call back over to Bob to wrap things up. George, I have a question about your guidance for the full year. I think it implies DCG declining again in Q4, pretty much in double-digit sequentially. So just trying to understand, I mean, is it primarily because of digestion that you talked about? And also if you can talk about to what extent you have visibility into Q4. Are you just taking a conservative stance because you just simply don't have visibility into Q4? Thanks, Bob, and thank you all for joining us today. Operator, could you please go ahead and wrap up the call?
