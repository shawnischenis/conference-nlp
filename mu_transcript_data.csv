MU,Q1 2017,2773,3418,2590,"Thank you, Lateef, and welcome to Micron Technology's first quarter 2017 financial conference call. On the call with me today are Mark Durcan, CEO and Director; and Ernie Maddock, Chief Financial Officer. This conference call, including audio and slides, is also being webcast from our Investor Relations website at investors.micron.com. In addition, our website contains the earnings press release filed a short while ago and supplemental information including quarterly operational and financial metrics and guidance, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, slides used during today's conference call, and a convertible debt and capped call dilution table. Today's call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. A webcast replay will be available on our website for one year. We encourage you to monitor our website at micron.com throughout the quarter for the most current information on the Company, including information on the various financial conferences that we will be attending and our 2017 analyst conference which will be held on Thursday, February 2. You can also follow us on Twitter @MicronTech. As a reminder, the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. We refer you to the documents the Company files with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-Q and 10-K, for a complete discussion of these important factors and other risks that may affect our future results. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today's date to conform these statements to actual results. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million, or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income, all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion. In the first quarter, we saw an acceleration of the positive market conditions that began this fall. For the industry, supply is slowing, demand is strong in a number of key segments, and inventory is at low levels. Prices have been strengthening on a like-for-like basis across all leading edge DRAM and NAND products and we see this trend continuing into the current quarter. To give you some perspective on pricing dynamics, after declining for roughly 18 months, PC DRAM ASPs are up 50% to 60% compared to the trough pricing, driven by an improvement in demand, historically low inventory levels and the impact of supply shifts to other segments. In contrast, all other DRAM segments declined substantially less over the same period and are recovering at a slower rate. Given the duration of the broad supply/demand tightness in the market, we are currently seeing improvements in quarter-over-quarter pricing trends in these non-PC segments. Taking all these variables together, blended DRAM ASPs are essentially flat compared to the same period last year. With this in mind, and as we look at our current quarter, operational execution is driving DRAM sales up more than $1 billion year-over-year, while our cost of goods sold is up only about half this amount, driving substantial improvements in gross margins. Product mix has a more significant impact on the NAND landscape where we are also experiencing like-for-like pricing increases. However, we are also shifting our product portfolio to 3D and TLC NAND which enables higher density and lower cost products that also have lower ASPs. Taken together, blended NAND ASPs are down approximately 10% year-over-year while gross margins are up meaningfully. Turning to the industry outlook, we currently expect 2017 DRAM bit supply growth in the 15% to 20% range. This is based on an assumption that suppliers won't add significant wafer capacity to the industry, but will continue to focus on process node migrations to enable cost reductions and natural supply growth. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 20% to 25%. We expect favorable supply and demand dynamics to persist in 2017. For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast of approximately 40% to 45%. 3D conversions continue to be a headwind to industry supply growth. This factor, along with strong demand for storage and mobile solutions, sets up for a well-balanced supply and demand dynamic in 2017. I'll now provide a high level overview of each of our business units and Ernie will follow with more details on their specific financial performances. In the Compute and Networking business unit, we experienced revenue growth as a result of strengthening or strengthened demand. We executed well to our 20-nanometer shipment plan and achieved key qualifications of 64 gigabyte LRDIMMs at multiple server customers. We also continued our strong performance in the graphic segment where our GDDR5X technology leads competitors. In our Mobile business unit, the completion of our customer qualifications drove substantial revenue and profit growth this quarter. As noted last quarter, we continue to see the Chinese market driving mobile growth and higher memory content per smartphone. We had strong growth in our LPDRAM and mobile NAND product lines and are focused on new qualification opportunities as we see the mobile market as one of the strongest growth drivers of our business. Our Embedded business was driven by strong demand across a variety of segments. Our NAND-based MCPs continue in business and machine-to-machine communications modules and our strong portfolio also brought us significant share in several new home automation and action camera platforms this quarter. We expect our new application Optimize SD cards to drive market share gains within both the industrial and connected home segments. Our Automotive business had another excellent quarter. We're securing an increasing number of automotive design wins on our leading edge, managed NAND and 20-nanometer DRAM products. We also see automotive demand for advanced memory technologies accelerating as more sophisticated ADAS systems come to market in the years ahead. Our Storage business unit continues to make progress shifting our portfolio to advanced 3D NAND technologies. First, the 1,100 client SSDs we announced last quarter completed qualifications and we commenced volume shipments with several major customers. This complements our crucial MX300 consumer drive which is currently shipping in high volumes. Additionally, we announced our cloud-based 5100 SATA SSD earlier this month offering industry leading performance and 8 terabyte capacities. All three of these SSDs are built with our TLC 3D NAND and illustrate our focused portfolio transition to this high capacity, high performance and cost effective technology. We continue to provide updates with respect to critical targets related to operational execution originally shared at our Analyst Day in August of 2015. Thus far, these milestones include bit crossover on 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND, and the SSD product release road map have all been achieved on or ahead of schedule. Our two-year bit growth and cost per bit targets remain on track and we continue to be focused on delivering to our commitments. Our focus in DRAM this year is primarily related to the deployment of our 1X nanometer technology. We're targeting meaningful output on 1X by the latter part of FY17. We expect to generate approximately 20% to 25% cost per bit reductions in FY17. Our cash costs for bit declines will be well above this range. For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen 1 3D, as well as TLC. We have also commenced production on our second generation 64-layer 3D technology and we're targeting meaningful output by the latter part of FY17. The 3D and TLC ramps will deliver 20% to 25% cost per bit improvement in FY17. This cost per bit includes the impact of expanding our SSD, eMCP and managed NAND solutions which carry additional bill of materials and costs, but will also enable a richer ASP mix. Relative to 3D XPoint technology, we will be shipping our QuantX solutions for revenue in 2017 and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success. This month, just after our quarter closed, we finalized the acquisition of Inotera in Taiwan which we expect to continue to provide strategic and financial opportunities for the Company. We are excited to welcome the Inotera team to Micron and look forward to realizing the benefits of the new operating model. Now I'd like to turn it over to Ernie. Thank you, Mark.  As we indicated earlier this month, we continue to see positive trends in the overall business environment resulting in fiscal Q1 performance that came in above the high end of the guidance ranges we provided in October. Today I'll first discuss some technology and business unit details followed by an overview of the Company's results for the quarter and guidance for our fiscal second quarter. DRAM represented 61% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile represented about 30%, up from 25% the prior quarter. The PC segment was in the mid-20% range and the server business was in the high-teens percent range. Specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the mid-20% range, down from the prior quarter. In our Non-Volatile Memory business, trade revenue represented 32% of total revenue, with the following segmentation. Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented 40%, down from the prior quarter. Mobile was in the low-20% range, up from the prior quarter, as we saw the continued impact of our completed customer qualifications. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the Mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-teens range, up from the prior quarter and the automotive, industrial multi-market, and other embedded applications were in the 20% range. Turning to performance by business unit, the Compute and Networking business unit reported fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.47 billion, up 18% sequentially, primarily due to stronger demand and higher 20-nanometer shipments and a stronger pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating profit was $204 million or 14% of revenue. In the Enterprise segment, we executed well in shipping 20-nanometer solutions to the market and qualified several lower cost products at multiple customers. Cloud was CMBU's fastest growing segment and Micron is now qualified on most high volume sockets for the top customers in this segment. Demand is being driven by both our leading edge DDR4 solutions, as well as continuing need for DDR3. In graphics, we had continued share growth in GDDR with our major graphics customers. New graphics card launches and strong console sales sustained favorable demand for both GDDR5 and GDDR5X. In Networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth, bolstered by the continued transition to 20-nanometer, 4 gigabyte DDR3 and 8 gigabyte DDR4. We continue to see strong interest in our high performance memory portfolio, as well. Finally, within the client segment, ASP strength exceeded our expectations and solid execution on 20-nanometer drove improved shipments and cost reductions. The mobile business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $1.03 billion, up 54% sequentially, driven by completed customer qualifications and strong sales of LPDRAM and mobile NAND products in an improved pricing environment. The non-GAAP operating income was $89 million or 9% of revenue, as we continue to ramp our 20-nanometer products and made substantial progress reducing higher cost early production inventory. The Embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $578 million, up 13% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $178 million or 31% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by seasonally strong consumer business and record automotive revenue. Embedded ASP trends tend to be more stable compared to the broader compute and mobile markets, but we are beginning to see the benefit of tightening supply/demand in this business unit, as well. Consumer revenue was up 25% sequentially, driven by home automation and camera application. In addition, our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into some 4K set-top box applications. The Automotive business performed well with revenue up 7% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. These solid results continue to be driven by strong and increasing demand for both DDR3 and e.MMC solutions for infotainment, instrument cluster and LPDRAM for advanced driver assist systems applications. The industrial and multi-market business increased 6% sequentially with a strong quarter for our NOR business combined with ramping our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see growing demand for our industrial grade managed NAND solutions. The Storage business delivered fiscal Q1 revenue of $860 million, up 13% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million, or 5% of revenue. During the quarter, SBU strengthened both the NAND and SSD product portfolios, having now entered fully ramped production and customer qualification of 3D TLC NAND client and cloud drives. Our ramp of 3D TLC cost competitive products will position us to effectively participate more fully in this growth segment. SBU is also benefiting from a favorable supply/demand balance in the industry with like-for-like pricing improving for many products. Demand drivers look strong for the foreseeable future. Moving on to overall Company results, revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $3.97 billion, up 23% sequentially, and driven by strong volume shipments for DRAM combined with increasing ASPs. Trade NAND shipments also increased as a result of the successful crossover of 3D production which occurred in the quarter, and we experienced stable blended ASPs with like-for-like ASPs trending up in many cases. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 26%, up from 19% in the prior quarter, driven by a strong pricing environment, particularly for DRAM, and solid execution on cost per bit reductions. NAND cost reductions were driven by an ongoing ramp of 3D and the portfolio shifting to higher density TLC enabled solutions. Non-GAAP net income was $335 million, or $0.32 per share. Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue increased 24% compared to the prior quarter as a result of an 18% increase in bit shipments and a 5% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the first quarter increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 28%, primarily driven by the strong pricing environment and continued 20-nanometer ramp. Our Non-Volatile Trade revenue increased 26% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 26% increase in bit shipments. ASPs were relatively unchanged from the prior quarter on a blended basis. Gross margin increased 6 percentage points sequentially to 23% as cost per bit was down 8%, benefiting from the 3D and TLC ramps. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $594 million, slightly below the lower end of our guided range, driven by lower prequalification expenses, lower legal costs, and higher expense sharing credits. The Company generated cash flow of $1.1 billion, an increase of $200 million over last quarter, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.3 billion. In the first fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.18 billion. Moving now to the guidance for the second quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: Consolidated revenue in the range of $4.35 billion to $4.7 billion, gross margin in the range of 31% to 34%, operating expenses between $590 million and $640 million, operating income ranging between $800 million and $900 million, and EPS ranging between $0.58 and $0.68 per share based on 1.123 billion diluted shares. Please note that as indicated earlier this month, we expect the impact from the Inotera acquisition to be accretive beginning this quarter. Specifically, for fiscal quarter 2, we expect the accretion to positively impact gross margins by low-single-digit percentage and contribute approximately $0.02 to EPS. These impacts have already been included in the guidance I just provided and will not be further distinguished as we provide guidance in future quarters. From an operational perspective, we remain on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that we've previously shared and we look forward to sharing more details on our progress and plans at our analyst conference on February 2. With that, I will turn it back to Mark. Thank you, Ernie. To summarize, we're entering our second quarter with a number of positive drivers across the business. The markets for both DRAM and NAND are healthy and improving, and I'm pleased with our operational execution over the past several quarters. We will continue deploying leading edge technology and shifting our product portfolio toward higher value segments and products. Operator, we're now ready to begin the Q&A.","We already had included the benefits of that since we took 100% of the output. So it really represents no material change to anything we've provided previously. Obviously, we said all along that as we have full managerial control of the entity we will have increased operational flexibility and the opportunity to potentially fine-tune some of our management practices, et cetera. We expect that over time that will provide some modest benefits to manufacturing efficiency. All of those are baked into our overall projections on a go-forward basis and we don't anticipate breaking out individual fabs for you on a go-forward basis. Micron did not actually participate in the gathering of tech executives that happened recently. Through our activities, our ongoing activities and engagement with government, we continue to stay involved in all sorts of policies that we believe impact our business. But there's really nothing specific that we would have to say about how that transition is going or anything of that nature at this point. I'm sorry to 1X nanometer? On the DRAM front? We're very pleased with the product progress we're making. We have a number -- a broad set of products that are supported by that 1X technology. It's running in Japan, as well as our DRAM fab in Taichung, and we have a number of mobile products, as well as compute and server products, all of which are progressing on schedule and we're quite happy with. Yes, just to reiterate, we believe it will be significant late in the fiscal year in terms of the bit output. It's a very significant shrink for us. So we're very excited about the efficiencies that will bring to our operation, but its impact will occur later in the fiscal year. Yes, we don't have any bit growth update for you relative to the two-year CAGRs that we had previously forecast. We're still on track to sustain those numbers, and trying to get down quarter-to-quarter, we think, is less productive than continuing to focus on that long-term productivity increase in trend. Yes, so first of all, on PCs, I think you've got the same market data we have there. The PC industry ended up maybe a little stronger than any of us anticipated. Still from a unit perspective, flattish to maybe down a percent, but overall generating about 10% DRAM bit growth going into that segment. Mobile is interesting. We continue to see pretty good bit growth by system. On average for the mobile market, probably moving to 2.4 gigabytes of DRAM and high 30%s, somewhere in the 35% to 40%, maybe in the middle of that range in terms of gigabytes of NAND. So if you net that out, that's almost 20% DRAM bit growth per system and maybe a little north of 40% on NAND. So for that market in aggregate, pretty strong, and in particular the value smartphone probably seeing the highest bit growth per system of any of those segments. I think I'd guide you to low-teens millions, which would be low-single-digit tax rate and that will change as the Company's profitability changes. Obviously, when the profitability goes up, the tax rate will sequentially decline a little bit because of where that income is generated and should the Company's profitability decline, the actual rate will creep up just a little bit. We don't have a great crystal ball as to what our competitors are doing. We read the same reports that you guys read. All of that, plus all the other internal intelligence we can generate, is baked into our ranges and in the data sheet that we provided. So I think there has been some chatter recently potentially about a few incremental wafers from one of the suppliers. Our view of that is if that were to happen it's a relatively minor adjustment in terms of the overall scope of the bit growth that we're projecting and that would probably not cause us to change that range that we've given you. Yes, so to be consistent with my prior comments, first thing I want to do is make sure we generate the cash, which we're working on feverishly and expect to make some headway on here with the results we've just shared. And then as we get to that point and look at the credit markets, as well as a number of other factors, we will make a determination about the best way to delever. But delevering for the Company remains an important priority as we have an expectation of increased free cash flow this year. So first of all, let me say that comments that I make in the press are sometimes not in the full context of the discussion I had. And I think one of the things to think about in terms of what might or might not happen in China is that these things do take time. Our investment cycles take place over periods of useful life of equipment of five years. We think in the long term, when we think about investing in our business to make sure that we're being good stewards of the shareholders' money, but anything that would happen there is going to play out over many years. And having a crystal ball as to exactly how that will play out is difficult to say. Relative to what Micron has said about our interests in China, we have a great interest in doing business in China. We have large existing operations there including back end operations, circuit design, product engineering activities, as well as software and firmware activity. We have a lot of activity in China already from an operations perspective and we have a large number of important customers over there. So we stay fully engaged with China and continue to expect to have strong relationships there and grow our business. Relative to whether we would undertake any expansion or licensing activity in China, what we said is really as it has been, which is our job is to look for opportunities to make Micron a stronger Company. And we will continue to investigate lots of options about ways to generate shareholder value, whether it's in China or any other part of the world. And that's just part of us being effective managers of the Company, and we'll continue to do that and if we can figure out things that make the Company stronger, we'll always consider that in terms of the long-term benefits and act accordingly. So, Tim, really, it's an issue of what you think any such tariffs of whatnot, how they would impact our end market, not necessarily as they directly impact Micron, because typically we manufacture overseas. We sell in many cases overseas, and then it's our customers who would then be subject to any of those importation issues. I think it's really too soon to tell what the impact of that would be because simultaneously we're reading about a dramatic reduction of the corporate tax rate and also the ability to repatriate billions of dollars of cash. So there's a lot of moving pieces to this, and I think anybody who would portend to be able to specifically predict things is probably guessing a little bit right now. At the end of the day, Joe, it's got to be adding up all the pieces, right, and having less supply than demand. I will say that as the end markets that we ship into continue to segregate and the product has to find its way into the right -- or the wafers have to find their way into the right product at the right time for the right segment, getting that balance exactly right segment to segment becomes difficult. And, therefore, I think it provides the opportunity for supply -- for pricing to react to changes in supply and demand in a way that I think is positive from a manufacturer's perspective. There's definitely a tail and it definitely exists for a long time. The question is how significant is that in terms of bits and what eventually will be the pricing in that long tail. I think that the planer bits are going to get squeezed out of a lot of the end market applications as we start to generate more 3D supply as an industry. However, there will be a long tail that's probably less than 10% of the overall market that sticks around for a long, long time and serves very valuable niches. It's a matter of getting that balance right, making sure you have the product, have the right products in that -- in those lagging nodes so you can address the right market opportunities. It's always tricky when you have customers with supply expectations, making sure that you are making the right commitments that you can deliver on while not significantly over or under committing. There are lots of those segments that are value-add where you have to have long-term customer relationships where there's a certain amount of trust, and I think from Micron's perspective, that's actually an advantage for us. Our customers like us. They want us to succeed. We have a long-term history of meeting our commitments, and so I think in this kind of environment that actually plays out pretty well for us. Some of the specific segments that are value-add that are pretty important, things like graphics, we grew our graphics business pretty substantially this year. In many cases, those are sole source relationships, or two sources at most, and a significant piece of the customer's end product and so those types of relationships, I think, are flagships for that kind of thought process. Automobile also, I think, is another one where Micron has very significant market share, deep relationships with the customers and a trust that we're going to be there for them with the right products as markets tighten up. This is Ernie. I think the best way to think about it is what Mark articulated earlier, which is the cost synergies are relatively small. The real opportunity will be as we align the manufacturing capability fully to the best of Micron's fabs, and that will provide more incremental opportunity to us than the cost savings piece. We had pretty good growth, obviously, in all geographies and with a lot of different customers with the mobile business doubling. Some of that was with the market leaders, but a lot of it also was in China. So EMCPs have been a great business for us.  A lot of that is in the Chinese value handsets, and I don't think we want to get specific in terms of percentages, but I think it's fair to say that we had strong growth in China, as well as at some of the high end smartphone manufacturers. Yes, I'd say it's tight there, but product is moving around, right? The industry is not static, and what tends to happen as the market tightens up like this is people will sacrifice a little bit of short-term margin to move product into segments they believe are longer term, more advantaged. There's a little bit of that going on right now where perhaps margins might actually be a little higher in PCs, but people may shift production into servers because it's viewed as potentially longer term, more favorable, or mobile because it's maybe a slightly more defendable market share as things change over time. First of all, at a high level, we're going to continue to outgrow the market in terms of bits like we talked about, and we're reducing cost at a faster rate than we have over the last three years. So that gap will continue to narrow with the forecast we've given you. Specifically, relative to 110 Series, yes, it's a good shrink. We have -- as I mentioned, we've got a number of different products coming. Some of them are bigger shrinks than others. We're pretty -- particularly excited about some of the ones that come later in the fiscal year that really drive out a lot of cost and die size, as opposed to some of the ones that come earlier and fill value-added potential segments or specific power or performance attributes that the customers are looking for. Beyond that, I think it's fair to say that we should get a good bang for the buck on this technology transition, not only because it's a substantial shrink, but also because a chunk of it, a large chunk of it's happening in Taichung, so we're actually transitioning capacity from 25-nanometer all the way down to 1X. So it's as we did with 20-nanometer in Hiroshima and Inotera, and a big chunk of that capacity at Inotera was a double hop from 30 nanometer to 20 nanometer.  This will be a double hop from 25 to 1X at the Taichung fab, and so there is a pretty good bang for the buck there. I think you're going to see us make some steady quarter-on-quarter growth, but I don't think in DRAM particularly you're going to see it continue at the levels that you've seen it for the last couple quarters. And I think the best guidance we can provide is that we're going to be roughly year-on-year to get to our targets, we're going to need to be at or slightly above 50% in terms of bit growth year-on-year. We've just given you a pretty big number for Q1.  So that math is getting easier and easier to work out. I would also tell you relative to some of the pricing, you'll note that we widened our revenue guidance range a little bit and that's reflective of a bigger business, and the fact that we realize pricing environment continues to be dynamic. So we did try to reflect our best thinking in the guidance that we've provided to you. On full conversion, think of it as roughly doubling the bits per wafer, and think of a cost down in the range of greater than 30%. So it's a big transition, but it's also, as we mentioned, won't start to become significant until later in FY17. We're very focused on the technology upgrades that we were talking about with John a minute ago. That's where we get the biggest bang for the buck. We do have some clean room space around the network, but we have no plans to add new wafers this year. It definitely will be this quarter in aggregate. We expect TLC to be greater than 50% of the 3D bits. Yes, we definitely plan to grow our share. As you point out, the fact that our share is relatively small in those segments today means there's a lot of opportunity. We do have what we think is a much better product portfolio now that's got a lot of customer excitement and eagerness, and we think that we're well-positioned with long-term customers who really want to buy from Micron. So, yes. That's a question that's got a thousand relative comparisons in it. What I would tell you is look, we are a different Company than at the last peak. We have a higher mix of NAND. We have a technology progression that we've tried to share with you. Certainly, I think we've outlined our cost reductions over the next three quarters or so, if you take the broad guidance we've provided. We've provided bit growth targets. You get to overlay a pricing environment and from that derive a gross margin profile. But I would expect if you have a similar market, you're going to continue to see opportunity for us to expand our gross margins. It's somewhere in the $4 billion plus or minus range, and one of the reasons that -- and we're very focused on protecting that NOL, which is the reason we put our NOL rights plan in place and it's been the proxy now and up for shareholder review, as well. And we intend to do everything we can to continue to preserve our ability to use that because these are exactly the times that we want to have the ability to do that. No, because that would apply to US income and earnings which are taxed, unfortunately, at a much higher rate than 5%. That's right. There are no significant restructuring charges anticipated. We borrowed $2.5 billion relative to Inotera. So we would expect that to be somewhere -- our total debt to be somewhere in the range of $12 billion, high $12 billion, maybe $13 billion, plus or minus. There's a few little moving pieces around. We're sitting here with cash this quarter at $4.3 billion. There was a cash component to the transaction of about $500 million, and then we'll generate operating cash flow and free cash flow in fiscal Q2, which we don't guide. So the result of that will be where we'll be at cash, but I would expect based on everything I know that it's reasonable to think flat or higher. We've got a -- as I mentioned earlier, Kevin, we've got a broad spectrum of products. We're trying to make sure we get as many of them qualified early in the ramp as possible this time and do a slightly better job than we did at 20-nanometer. So actually we have mobile and compute products coming, and then we have additional cost reduced and broader market applications behind that. Sorry, can you repeat the question? We're talking to a number of different customers and we probably don't want to say yet. Thank you. Not really, Mark. We've heard rumors along the lines of those that you're alluding to, I believe, but we can't validate -- I can't validate those for you. Certainly, in most market segments, it's very, very tight, and any time you have that and customers start get nervous about, are they potentially going to go line down, et cetera, you always start to be concerned that people are just trying to get a little bit ahead of it and build some inventory. I think that's only natural. I think we're doing a pretty good job of trying to allocate this product where it's absolutely most needed, and so I don't think too many people are building up too much inventory. Well, I think it's -- I think that part of what happened in the last -- latter stage of the last cycle were perhaps a little bit of miscalculation by one of the suppliers. But they probably learned from. So there's that. The biggest change structurally in the market, though, really is the fact that the products are going into a much broader set of end markets, much more broadly distributed now we're three or four years on from where we were in the last cycle. And I think that does make a difference. On top of that -- Mark, I'll add one more piece to that, which is a long-term trend that we've talked about in the past in terms of slowing technology migrations, means that competitors in the marketplace are likely doing math with numbers that are changing less rapidly than they used to be. So both from a demand and a supply perspective, as those numbers get smaller and the slope gets smaller, and the rate of change, it gets a little bit easier to do the math and to keep things in balance. And then finally, you layer on what's going on with NAND right now from a demand perspective, it's just explosive, I think, is probably the right word in terms of demand and elastic, as well. I think there's maybe some insulation there that wasn't there last time around. Operator, we have time for one more question. A question on export? Is that what -- XPoint. Oh, XPoint. Not early, no. The question was asked, who are we going to ship to first? We're not going to tell you who we're going to ship to first, but longer term it's storage, it's data center, and it's mobile applications, all of those. I think early on it's pure additive demand in the overall memory market. We get two or three years in and have more substantial ramp going on and cost reduction, yes, I think it will over time cannibalize part of the DRAM business. Very tight, very tight. Customers are quite concerned. Thank you, everyone. This now concludes Micron Technology's first quarter 2017 financial release conference call. You may now disconnect.","Hi, this is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. Thanks very much for taking the question, and congrats on the great quarter. First of all, just regarding Inotera, could you help us understand roughly how much you expect consolidating it, fully consolidating operations to add to bit output on the DRAM side in the February quarter? No, I just mean in terms of -- obviously, you'd expect the recognized bit output to be up quarter-on-quarter. Any guide in terms of like what percentage of the existing -- . Okay, that's helpful.  And then as a quick follow-up, there's been, obviously, a lot in the news about potential changes to policies with the new presidential administration coming in. As I recall, you guys had a chance to sit down and chat some of that over with them. I was just curious if you had any thoughts about how some of the [river] changes are going to impact your business in the coming years? Okay. Thanks much, and congrats again on the strong quarter. Hi, guys, congrats on a great set of results here. Just on the DRAM side, I know you mentioned that, obviously, great results there, as well. How is 60-nanometer going? How do you see the transition to 60-nanometer as you progress through the year? Yes. That's correct. Great. And on the 3D NAND side, happy to see you guys start up the second generation 64 layer. Any thoughts on how we should see that progress? Obviously on crossover already, but how do you see the 64 layer ramping through 2017? Thanks. Great, thank you. Hi, yes, good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. First question, was hoping you could help us understand the sustainability of some of the strong bit growth trends that you reported in the November quarter. I think you've talked about growing above the market in 2017 in both DRAM and in NAND. Can you sustain some of these types of strong sequential bit growth trends as you look into February? Got it. Okay. And then for a follow-up question, I was hoping you could help us understand a little bit more on some of the end market trends in PCs and handsets, and if you could elaborate specifically on what you're seeing in terms of demand trends in the China handset market? Thank you very much. Yes, thank you. Congratulations, as well, on excellent results. Housekeeping question first, on the taxes, I think this quarter was about $30 million. Can you give some sense of what the guidance for taxes going forward would be? Okay. Great. And in the commentary you had mentioned around 15% to 20% bit supply growth in DRAM baring any additional supply from competitors. Can you talk a little about the -- what you're seeing in terms of the transition to 18-nanometer for some of your competitors, and is there risk in your mind in terms of additional supply coming online, any thoughts on that would be helpful? All right, great. And last question, in terms of on the balance sheet, how do you think about reducing the level of debt going forward now that you're entering into a period of higher free cash flow generation?  We're at about $8.5 billion, or close to $10 billion of debt. Any thoughts on the strategy about reducing debt levels over time? Okay. Great. Thanks again. Thank you very much. First question, Mark, you made some recent comments about China and about them potentially flooding the market if they do get access to IP, so my question is, can you again remind us of what your mission statement is around the potential of sharing IP or licensing IP into China? Thanks. Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then I had a follow-up to a question that was asked about some of the tax law changes coming. It seems pretty obvious that there's going to be some sort of VAT that gets added to product that's made outside the US and you guys are, obviously, fairly exposed to that. So I'm wondering, is there any like contingency planning happening?  And I'm trying to assess the likelihood that maybe CapEx might have to be a little higher as you may have to plan for some of those contingencies. Thanks. Okay, Ernie. Thank you. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you can just give us some context on why the markets are so good? And in particular, when I look at your shipments have been stronger than I expected, your competitors' shipments have been a bit stronger than I expected, and yet our checks, and everyone's checks show this -- good now and staying good for a while. Can you give us any context on why the supply/demand balance has shifted so much in a favorable direction when everyone's shipping more bits than the sort of long-term trend line? Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, secondly, in terms of your NAND planning, is there going to continue to be a long tail on the planer NAND business, or do you see the whole business transitioning to 3D over time? That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Hi. Good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the higher margin, higher mix products where maybe -- where you mentioned like-for-like pricing also getting better. For example, in the storage business unit with SSDs, how are you managing your customer expectations for longer design cycles and qualification cycles given that product is tight now and you're saying it could be tight for a while, especially as you ramp 3D NAND and maybe it has some puts and takes along the way? That's really helpful. And then just a quick clarification, so on Inotera I understand you don't want to go too much deeper into the numbers, but in terms of some of the synergies that are potentially ahead of you with Inotera, should we just think of it more as the flexibility to manage bits a little bit more efficiently or should we consider that there could be some meaningful cost savings that could come through to the margins down the road? Thanks. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks, guys. Quick question on the mobile end market. You talked about China as being a big driver there. Can you give us any sense of how big China is as far as your mobile demand or how big of the increase it was sequentially? Great. And then a second question on another end market PCs. Again, we all read the same stuff you do about shortages in DRAM in the PC end market. I would you say that is the end market where supply is tightest, and any estimate of when these lead times could be -- these extending lead times could be relieved? Okay, thanks, guys. Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Mark, my first question is just around sort of your DRAM profitability versus peers. Absolutely, clearly, DRAM is getting better, but there's still this gap between the peers. I'm wondering if you can talk about the 1X transition for you? It seems like there's two vectors where you might be able to close that gap. One, it just seems like a better shrink for you than maybe your peers, and, two, correct me if I'm wrong, but of most of Rexchip, I believe, is still at 25 nanometers. So it might seem to me that as you guys move to 1X you'll have a bigger wafer start base at 1X than you had at 20 nanometers. Am I thinking about that the right way, or how are you thinking about it? That's helpful. And then, guys, as my follow-up, you're still endorsing the two-year CAGRs for bit growth in NAND and DRAM for you. Ernie, I know you don't want to get into quarter-by-quarter, but I'm curious as how we should think about linearity of that bit growth from here on out for this fiscal year for both DRAM and NAND? And I ask the question because specifically for DRAM, if it's a linear growth rate, it just seems like the February numbers are still embedding some very conservative assumptions around pricing given how good the environment is. So how do I think about that dynamic? Perfect. Thanks, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Yes, thanks so much for taking my question. First question, Mark or Ernie, how should we think about cost reduction for Gen 2 NAND versus your Gen 1, and when do you think it might become visible for you guys? Okay. Then on the DRAM front, I just wanted to find out if there is going to be any meaningful wafer capacity additions from Micron in FY17. Is there a fab where you have some additional headroom for you to invest or should you invest in a new greenfield? Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon, guys, and solid job on the quarterly execution. And also congrats on the 600-basis-point inflection in NAND gross margins. If we focus on this, clearly, 3D bit crossover was a big driver going forward, as I think about more cost per bit declines, you still have the benefits of continued higher 3D mix, higher TLC 3D mix on Gen 1. Question here is, when should we expect TLC 3D crossover with 3D MLC? Is that going to be this quarter? Great. Thanks for that. And then at the product level, based off of third party estimates, the enterprise SSD market's about a $10 billion market growing at about 25% year-over-year for the next few years. You guys have low-single-digits market share while you're JV partner has about 35% market share here. High capacity SATA is the biggest portion of this market. You just announced the 5100 Series that's 3D TLC. Can you guys just give us a sense on when you're going to start shipping this in volume production? Are the large hyper scale guys the lead customers here? And just given what looks to be a step-up in the road maps and maybe some of your customer feedback, do you guys anticipate growing your shares here in the enterprise space in 2017? Thank you. Yes, thank you. I just wanted to ask a question about gross margin. The guidance is much better than expected. I'm just curious, how would you suggest we think about the gross margin potential of Micron considering your mix, cost road map, and whatever baseline pricing assumptions you're making? Is last cycle's, your peak gross margin  a good guidepost for us, or are you thinking about it differently? Okay. Thanks, Ernie. Can I also ask you, what's the net operating -- the NOL balance today, and can you just educate us on restrictions in terms of utilizing that asset against future tax provisions? Does a $4 billion balance mean that whatever the tax rate is, 5%, is the right way to think about your rate over the next several years? Okay. So you can only utilize it for US income? Okay. Got it. Thank you. Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of what you expect your debt and cash and equivalents might be at the end of the February quarter following the Inotera payments? And apart from CapEx, are there any significant post-acquisition cash charges for restructuring or anything else to do with Inotera? Great. Thanks very much. Thank you. On your transition to the 1X DRAM process, will this be any different than past transitions, meaning are you going to be coming out into the PC market first and then mobile, or will these be targeted for certain markets? Okay. Great. And on your 3D XPoint, you said that you'd have your first revenue in 2017. Can you say what end market that would be? 3D XPoint, what's your first end markets for that? Okay. Congratulations on the great results and guidance. Hi. Thanks, and congrats on a great quarter. Question relating about where we are in the cycle right now. Things look really great on pricing. I wonder -- also you mentioned inventory on the DRAM maintenance level also looks good. Do you have any comments on the inventory level of the customers? I'm wondering particularly on the Chinese smartphone OEMs have been buying quite a lot of memory through the second half of 2016. And I'm just wondering if you're seeing any double ordering, any excess inventory on the customer side, anything at all that makes you a little bit concerned of excess inventory, either on the chip side or on the finished product side, especially on the handsets? Great. Thanks. And then if you think back to the previous, back in 2014, at the moment, this feels very much like 2014, pricing's strong, demand's good, supply/demand remains pretty tight. Anything different if you compare between now and then because, clearly, what happened in 2015 and 2016 wasn't quite what we were hoping for in terms of supply/demand balance and pricing. I'm just wondering if you had any comments on what is different between the previous cycle? Clearly, the industry is a lot better than the past, but the question is how much, and I'm just trying to ask if you have any particular thoughts of this time versus 2014 in particular? Thanks very much. Great. Thanks very much. Hi, this is Ada calling in for C.J. A question, another question on XPoint. Can you talk about whether you see that product impacting DRAM demand down the road? XPoint. And second question, in terms of the NAND channel inventory, how's that looking right now? Thank you.

For fiscal Q3 2016, Micron posted total revenue of $2.9 billion, with gross margin of 17%, a non-GAAP net loss of $79 million and a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 per share, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $389 million. Top line results were primarily impacted by continued weakness in the PC segment and the mobile qualifications we discussed last quarter. With recent data points indicating some improvement in channel pricing, an expectation of finalizing our mobile qualifications and continued progress on our technology and operational milestones, we remain confident about our opportunities. Today, I'd like to provide a brief overview of our progress in each of the businesses and Ernie will cover other business unit performance details. In our compute and networking business unit, we returned to revenue growth despite pricing pressure in the client segment. This was driven by the ongoing ramp of our 20-nanometer products, which exceeded 25-nanometer shipments on a bit basis for the first time. We enjoy continued 20-nanometer qualifications across all CNB market segments lead by our 8-gigabit DDR4 product in enterprise, cloud and client. In May, NVIDIA launched the world's fastest consumer graphics card designed with Micron's GDDR5X. We are excited about the prospects for this high performance memory product. In enterprise and cloud, we saw initial customer announcements based on our NVDIMM product offering with high performance persistent memory. Turning to our mobile business unit, our results continue to be impacted by the timing of product qualifications as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4. We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. We are ramping the output of these products throughout the quarter and into fiscal Q1 2017. We anticipate continued demand growth in mobile market in the fourth quarter in terms of both NAND and LPDRAM. In our embedded business unit, the automotive segment delivered record revenue driven by volume increases in DDR3 and increasing density mix in the e.MMC. Design activity remains strong with recent qualifications of automotive consumer and connected home applications. In the consumer MCP business, we saw some recovery that we expect to continue into fiscal Q4, aligning with seasonal demand. Finally, our storage business unit is in the midst of refreshing its SSD portfolio with a higher capacity 3D NAND memory technology. We also introduced Micron Accelerated Solutions, which are enabled by our enterprise SSDs and advanced DRAM, integrating compute and storage to improve efficiency and performance in a variety of storage applications. And we announced our new 110 SATA client SSDs leveraging triple level cell 3D NAND for class-leading performance and power efficiency. To summarize, our leading edge technology deployment continues to progress throughout manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND and we are on track with our bit growth and cost reduction targets. We believe the combination of new products with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive improvement in our competitive position in the rest of 2016 and beyond. Turning to the memory industry more generally, we believe that the DRAM industry supply growth will be in the low to mid-20% range in 2016, which is consistent with our prior commentary. If wafer output declines in the latter half of the year as some parties have forecast, we would expect to exit the year on a slower run rate and 2017 bit supply growth could be in the mid to high teens. This compares to our long-term bit demand forecast in the low to mid 20% range. The significant improvements we're seeing in channel pricing are not currently impacting other segments and as a result, we continue to take a conservative view of the market environment. For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid-30% to low 40% range, with a similar range in 2017 as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. Over the last several quarters, we've experienced strong demand coupled with aggressive pricing as suppliers have been driving to increase penetration rates and densities. Similar to DRAM, the current channel pricing environment appears to be improving but is not yet significantly impacted across other segments. Our long-term bit demand forecast is in the low 40% range as lower costs and higher performance 3D NAND solutions enter the market. From an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key priorities. For DRAM, we successfully achieved our targeted 20-nanometer crossover during fiscal Q3, and also enabled our 1x node in manufacturing. We expect to ramp 1x-nanometer DRAM in volume starting in 2017. We are still forecasting Micron's FY16 and FY17 DRAM bit growth in the 20% to 30% range, which is likely above the market. We achieved 22% bit growth in fiscal Q3, and expect even stronger bit growth in Q4. In light of current market conditions, we have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity. As noted above, we are migrating to advanced technology nodes in order to achieve cost reductions and adjust higher density designs for mobile, cloud and enterprise segments. For NAND, we continue to make great progress on our Gen-1 3D NAND and are reaching maturity yields ahead of expectations. We still expect to achieve 3D bit crossover by this fall, which will allow us to take advantage of the cost benefits that this technology provides. Our second generation 3D product is also on track with initial production this quarter. Equally exciting is that we expect TLC to be the majority of our 3D bit output within the next few quarters. In aggregate, we are forecasting Micron's FY16 and FY17 NAND bit growth in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be somewhat below the market in 2016, and somewhat above the market in 2017. TLC enabled 3D NAND technology is a big step forward and a significant driver relative to the progress we expect to make in our NAND business. This technology progress must be complemented by enabling product solutions for key storage and mobile segments. We've outlined our storage product road map, which includes our recently announced client SSDs, followed by cloud drives later this year and enterprise solutions early next year. We're also evaluating a number of mobile product opportunities for 3D NAND in 2017. Relative to 3D XPoint, we're working with market enablers across a number of market segments and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron's future success with revenue in 2017 and beyond. Micron has a committed focus on the deployment of advanced technology to drive manufacturing efficiency and enable innovative new products for our customers. While we haven't finalized our FY17 business plan, we are approaching that plan with prudence and conservatism and carefully reviewing our capital investments and projected operating cash flows to ensure the appropriate balance. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Ernie. Thanks, Mark. I'll start off by sharing technology and business unit details and circle back to the overall Company results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile was in the mid-20% range, the PC segment represented about 25%, the server business was in the low 20% range, and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the high 20% range. In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation. Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented about 55%. Mobile and SSDs each represented approximately 13% and as a reminder, eMCPs are accounted for in the mobile segment. The automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range. Moving on, I'll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. Micron's compute and networking business unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.09 billion, up 4% from the previous quarter, primarily driven by our 20-nanometer shipment growth across all segments and partially offset by lower average selling prices. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $63 million or 6% of revenue. In the enterprise segment, demand for our 20-nanometer 32-gigabit DDR4 RDIMM was driven by the launch of Intel's latest server platform. We also saw solid growth in the cloud segment with continued transition to DDR4. In graphics, we saw strong growth driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products and are approaching a seasonally strong period for graphics applications including virtual reality and expect good performance from this segment for the next quarter. In networking, our business was somewhat flat, however we made significant progress enabling our 20-nanometer products and also announced our eUSB 3.0 solution. Finally, within the client segment, we continued enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer 4-gigabit DDR3 and 8-gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs. In Micron's mobile business unit, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $561 million, up 12% from the prior quarter as we continued to ramp 20-nanometer LPDDR3 and LPDDR4. While the low density eMCP market is still under pressure, a move to higher density designs in FQ4 and early FY17, should help stabilize and improve this segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $17 million or 3% of revenue. We have successfully concluded some of the delayed qualifications that we discussed last quarter and we anticipate finalizing the remainder during fiscal Q4. This work will allow us to more fully ramp our 20-nanometer mobile products in fiscal Q4 and into next year. Both LPDRAM and NAND content continue to increase in mobile devices, which when combined with even modest unit growth will result in very solid bit consumption. In our embedded business, we posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $487 million, up 6% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating income of $107 million, or 22% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by continued strength in the automotive and consumer segments offset by softness in the industrial multi-market segment. In our automotive segment, we achieved record revenue increasing 6% quarter-over-quarter and 10% year on year. We continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and eMMC applications that include infotainment, instrument cluster and advanced driver assist systems and continue to see strong demand from our EMEA customers, which is more recently complemented by growth in Korea and demand recovery in North America. Our portfolio of leading edge solutions is enabling major 2018 platform automotive design wins. Our industrial multi-market business declined 9% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to global market softness in the manufacturing infrastructure segment. However, we continue to see healthy demand for our NOR and NAND-based MCPs used in machine to machine wireless communication modules. Our consumer and connected home revenue was up 3% quarter-over-quarter with some softness in the set top box business offset by strong demand for NAND and LPDRAM MCPs to support action camera and home automation applications. As we enter into a seasonally strong period, we expect demand to continue to grow. Customers are also beginning to design in and ramp our 20-nanometer DDR4 products into set top box applications. Micron storage business unit posted fiscal Q3 revenue of $719 million, down 20% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $62 million or 9% of revenue. As we transition to lower cost 3D NAND products, we continue to optimize our product mix. In client and consumer SSD, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 20% as we reduced production of planar NAND-based SSDs while ramping volume production of 3D NAND-based SATA and PCIe client and consumer SSDs. These new products will enable the Company to enhance its competitive position. In the Enterprise and data center SSD segments, consecutive quarter bits sold were down 10%. As we have previously noted, our 3D NAND solutions will improve our product portfolio in this segment enabling us to participate more significantly in this important growth business for the Company. Now looking at the Company overall, as Mark noted earlier, revenue for the third quarter was $2.9 billion, which was near the midpoint of our guided range and roughly flat compared to the prior quarter. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by decreases in selling prices, while trade NAND shipments declined as we are in the middle of a significant conversion from planar to 3D NAND. Gross margin for the quarter was 17%, within our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $79 million, or $0.08 per share, slightly better than the midpoint of our guided range. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. Taken together, these two items represent $0.05 per share for the recently completed quarter. Now, let's look at results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 9% compared to the second quarter, as a result of a 22% increase in bit shipments partially offset by lower selling prices. As the result of our 20-nanometer ramp and ongoing mobile qualification timeline, DRAM finished goods inventory increased during the quarter. DRAM gross margins for the third quarter decreased approximately 2 percentage points to 18% as decreases in ASPs outpaced significant cost reductions. Our nonvolatile trade revenue decreased 15% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a 10% decrease in bit shipments combined with a 6% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 17% as ASP reductions outpaced cost per bit reductions. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $523 million, below our guided range due to the reversal of accrued costs for variable compensation plans, which were suspended in the third quarter. The Company generated operating cash flow of $389 million, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.7 billion. Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.7 billion, and we continue to expect our FY16 capital expenditures to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion net of partner contributions. During the quarter, we received approximately $2 billion from the issuance of secured notes and an additional $114 million in equipment financing. Also, we resolved a long outstanding tax matter, which resulted in a $52 million benefit to the tax line. This benefit was offset by the write-off of a related $30 million receivable that was reflected as non-operating expense. In the third quarter, we also acquired Photronics' interest in our captive mask operations for $93 million, resulting in 100% ownership of the mask operations. Moving on to our guidance for the fourth quarter, on a non-GAAP basis we expect the following; consolidated revenue in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, gross margin in the range of 15.5% to 18%, operating expenses between $580 million and $630 million, and operating loss ranging between $135 million and $55 million, and an EPS loss ranging between $0.24 and $0.16 per share based on 1.036 billion diluted shares. Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction that we have previously shared as we continue to ramp our 20-nanometer DRAM and 3D NAND production. In recognition of the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on the Company's key priorities, we plan to implement a cost saving program, which we expect will save the Company approximately $80 million per quarter in FY17. The savings will result from a combination of our more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a material number of open headcount requisition and a workforce reduction in certain areas of the business, as well as other non-headcount related spending reductions. About half of these savings will appear in the gross margin line of the Company, while the remainder will be reflected in operating expenses. These savings are baseline against our previously planned 2017 fiscal spend levels. We expect to take reserves approximating $70 million for the cost of this program, the majority of which will occur in fiscal Q4, with the remainder in the early part of FY17. As we complete our FY17 planning process, we are mindful of the need to effectively balance period spending, CapEx and free cash flow and we continue to explore other opportunities to improve the Company's financial performance. Finally at this time, we don't have any new information to share relative to Inotera. As we stated in our press release, the transaction will not be closing in mid-July, and we expect to provide an update during the latter part of the calendar year. With that, I'll turn it back to Mark. Thank you, Ernie. To summarize, we continue to navigate challenging market conditions, but remain confident in the long-term health of the industry and the Company's strategy to improve our relative competitive position. The decision to implement cost reduction initiatives is always difficult and is never made without thoughtful consideration about the short-term and the long-term impacts. However, to ensure that we can continue to place emphasis on our most important Company priorities, we believe the steps Ernie outlined are prudent and will help deliver the best long-term results for the Company. I'd like to take a moment to thank our customers, partners, shareholders and team members for their continued support. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.","20-nanometer is a majority of the bits that we are shipping now and when we talked in our prepared remarks about strong bit growth above Q3 levels, you saw what the relative growth was in Q3 and you can assume that it will be a little bit north of that as we look at fiscal Q4. It's a low double digits today. As we commented, as we get into the back half of the calendar year, we expect a crossover. So that's coming pretty soon. So it's a pretty significant ramp from here over the next couple of quarters. You know, we typically don't comment on margins because of the function of our pricing environment that's moving around on us every day. And so really, what we have said is that the cost curves that we articulated in our Analyst Day are still legitimate. As you can imagine, when we do 3D crossover and NAND in the fall, that's when you can expect to see the accelerated cost reductions begin to occur there. And on the DRAM side with the bit growth that we delivered in fiscal Q3, as well as what we're forecasting for fiscal Q4, you can get some idea of what the cost reductions would be there. Maybe John, I can take that one instead of Ernie. Again, on the pricing environment as you noted, we're seeing -- there's obviously encouraging things going on in the channel. Before we start baking that into any sort of guidance we would give, we want to actually see that as it moves through other end market segments and out in the contract pricing et cetera. So really this is a question about the tailwinds we have and I think you did a nice job articulating for us. I think we've done a good job on the 20-nanometer ramp and we'll continue to see some improvement for that as we move through the next quarter. And we articulated pretty strong bit growth moving forward in both DRAM and in particular, maybe a couple of quarters out in NAND as we really see that transition kick in and the 3D TLC part of that transition kick in. So we've got a lot of good tailwinds. We also articulated we're making a lot of good progress on qualifying and resegmenting those more advanced technology nodes in the right market segments. And we do believe that you'll see progress relative to our competition in terms of how our margins move. We never know exactly what they are going to do and it's tough for us to predict what their results are going to look like given the pricing environment. Sure. So to the first part of your question, there are some very significant prequal expenses that we expect to incur in Q4 that are influencing the guidance that we provided for the quarter's OpEx. And then relative to the cost reduction, the only comfort perhaps I would offer you, which I hope is very strong comfort, is that we actually think very carefully about what we're doing here. And the decisions that we made with respect to the cost savings program were deliberated very thoughtfully debated and at the end, we believe we're at the right balance to both help improve the financial performance of the Company, while at the same time, not jeopardizing any of the Company's potential in terms of revenue opportunities. John, maybe I can add one point there just so everyone on the call is clear. I know you are. The pre-production R&D costs Ernie is referencing are really associated with a lot of new products in qual with the technology nodes that are now ramped. And some of those are costs that flow through the R&D now as opposed to directly on the cost flow and inventory. Well you know, it's a very dynamic environment. So again, we want to make sure we're giving you what we believe is realistic guidance and guidance that is achievable and we're going to have to see what plays out in the markets overtime. When spot pricing starts moving, that's a great indicator of where the markets might go. But what has to happen obviously, is there has to be enough liquidity in the market that it can carry through into larger volume orders associated with contract market and inventory has to burn off. And we're seeing good indications of those types of things, but we need to make sure the pudding is fully baked before we serve it. Well certainly, they will occur as there is a concentration of new products. So you shouldn't expect that they are going to occur each quarter. I would tell you that in Q4, they are particularly high relative to what we've seen over the recent history as a reflection of what Mark said. But it is likely that sometime during the course of 2017, you're also going to see these occur as we release new products. But again, we see a particularly high concentration in FY16 Q4. So Tim, relative to -- I'll take the second part of your question first and then we'll circle back around to the first. The stake in the ground is that we've said a few things, which were actually we reiterated today that would be in the opposite direction of thinking there were problems with our 3D NAND transition. We're seeing mature yields occurring at rates that are slightly faster than we anticipated. We had originally probably six months ago, talked about bit crossover for 3D at the end of the year. Today, we've reiterated again that that was going to occur in the fall. So a pull forward of a couple of months. And so, we're not going to give you bit guidance for the August quarter, but we do think that these data points will hopefully give you comfort that in fact the transition really is occurring slightly more rapidly than we have expected it to occur. The thing I would add to that Tim is keep in mind we've also talked about the fact that we want to deliver more of our NAND bits in actual solutions to the customer. And as we do that, there's a natural tendency to stretch out the supply chain in aggregate and some lengthening of the total manufacturing cycle time as we move through that transition. Part of this I think is also reflective of the fact that we're making some fairly significant progress relative to getting these bits into the types of end products that we want to deliver the customer. I think one final point that may be also contributing to the overall impression is we do see planar bits coming down fairly significantly as we move away from the planar SSD markets that we have sold into in the past. So there are many dynamics at play here relative to what comes out as an aggregate bit number. Well, you really asked two different questions right? How do we balance and obviously the balance has to come in as we think about the aggregate business of the Company and the cash flow that we plan to generate and a number of other factors. As we look at maintenance CapEx, we said that we were normalized in that low $4 billion range ex-Inotera, and we wouldn't move away from that in a very substantial way as we're thinking about things today. Bearing in mind that we're still in the midst of a ramp of 3D in the Singapore fab, so it isn't exactly a normalized environment for us. Even taking out the shell, we're still outfitting that shell with productive capacity. So David, it will be primarily -- a significant majority of that, in fact almost all of it, will still be gen one. Gen two, we start to see significant output in the second calendar quarter into the summer of 2017. And we haven't said what the layer count does, but we've indicated that it's roughly a 30% cost reduction moving from gen one to gen two and that it's roughly double the bits. This is Mark. Yes, absolutely. We are very happy with the way the ramp is going. We're very happy with the technology was delivering and its ability to scale going forward. We think it's the best solution in the industry for almost every end market application. Well, we think we're doing all the right things and we think we're making a lot of good progress on our relative competitive position on technology, the products are all coming along nicely now and the qualifications are progressing well. So there's always the wild card around ASPs, but we think we are making very significant progress and we think we'll see that every quarter as we move forward, you'll be able to measure us versus our competition. And hopefully confirm that we're doing all the right things. Exactly when that results in profitability, we can't tell you, but we think it's coming. Let me see if I can find those numbers. I don't have them right in front of me. For the mobile DRAM portfolio generally, EMCP probably represents -- Well, I'll jump in real quick Mark. So the way we break it out Kevin, is mobile DRAM discrete is reported in our DRAM business and that's about mid-20% of our total DRAM. Our EMCPs are reported in our NAND reporting segment and we said mobile was in the mid-teens percent of the NAND business, low to mid-teens. Again, it's really challenging to give you a forecast of what's going to happen with the pricing environment. But in terms of aggregate revenues, we would expect it as we move through these qualifications that you're going to see the mobile business maintain or slightly improve in terms of a percentage of its overall revenue to the business. And as we noted in our comments, as we see EMCP market moving to higher density, we think that will be a starting point for an improvement in that aggregate market, which has been weak actually in the last couple of quarters. And that's a quarter or so off as we roll into calendar 2017. So CJ, this is Ernie. We're pretty clear on the qualification timeline. There is more uncertainty around the timing of shipments because at the end of the day, that is going to be a function of each of those customers current inventory dynamics with respect to the inventories they have on hand, their success in the marketplace and how they want to position their inventory. And in addition to that, we are going to have as we already talked about, significant quarter on quarter growth in production. Some of which is directed toward that mobile market because we believe that it's fairly strong. So mobile in general, has a better gross margin profile than the aggregate business. So as that product flows through, although there will be some early pressure as a result of that inventory having been built at a time when costs weren't fully baked as the result of the volume ramp, eventually it will flow through into the margin profile of the Company. Yes, I think that it's probably most closely timed to an increase in our TLC mix, which is probably a couple of quarters out. And then we'll get a second surge in calendar Q2 and Q3 of next year as the gen two kicks in a significant way. But again, we think we'll be -- we think we'll be the leader as we fully implement gen two and TLC. So the first part of your assumption process Joe, is correct. And again, we're not going to comment on ASPs. Sure, so in the current pricing environment, what we've contemplated as we look forward to Q4, it's pretty much a wash to be honest with you. Either way, the results to Micron would be roughly the same. Yes, so let me try to characterize that a little bit for you. So it is important to recognize that these data points are really happening in realtime and as we look at how we actually entered this quarter, we were actually starting the quarter below the average of the prior quarter and we're now seeing some upward trends that are causing everyone to have the enthusiasm that we're talking about. But it is important to understand that what we've been reading about in the last two weeks has A, not impacted the entirety of the quarter and B, hasn't reflected itself yet as we look at forward pricing. And as Mark mentioned a couple times, we really are wanting to provide prudent guidance in the context of an environment moving around very significantly. The other point I would make is it is absolutely true that we are seeing strong bit growth and cost reductions on the DRAM side. Remember that we said the majority of the NAND cost reductions occur as we achieve that bit crossover, which is later in the fall of this year. So we are getting quarter on quarter cost reductions in NAND, but I think you might be perhaps pulling towards that bit crossover comment into the full quarter that we're coming up on and that's just not going to be the case. Well, they are both in the market and we're just going to have to see what the demand looks like. But so far, we like the reaction we're seeing. Definitely the 3D 32 layers is cost advantaged relative to 20-nanometer. Even 16-nanometer planar NAND. And we believe that as we move through time, the market is going to appreciate incremental value in 3D NAND business as well. We have a full product portfolio coming for 3D NAND that will address. And I think I mentioned this in my commentary, we have 3D NAND products for consumer, client, data center and enterprise as well as evaluating mobile applications on a go-forward basis. You know, I think we've gone through a very significant transition here. In some cases from 30-nanometer to 20-nanometer. In some cases from 25-nanometer to 20-nanometer. And from a timing perspective, in some cases we were later with a particular either density or IO or interface that the customers wanting. So it's just a matter of working through that process and qualifying those products in the various fabs that we're ramping. So I don't think there's anything untoward or unusual in that process. It's just a matter of a fairly significant ramp across two high volume fabs and taking the time to qualify a full suite of products across all those technologies. So certainly, we think 3D NAND has gone very well for that. For us, that has been really a model where we take technology we've developed in fab four and move it into a consistent equipment set and a historically Micron environment where the equipment all matches and things go very well. What we experienced in 20-nanometer, is we're matching a disparate set of equipment given the Elpida acquisition. So we have got one tool set in Hiroshima, on tool set in the MMT fab in Taichung, and a separate tool set in the Inotera fab. And that's just more complicated. And every time we make this transition, we get more and more of those tools aligned and we feel like actually we're in pretty good shape now. And as we move to the 1x node beyond that, it's going to be a lot more seamless and a lot easier to execute on a go-forward basis. So we think we're the leader in 3D and we think we're getting closer in DRAM and 1x is coming along now running at a preproduction levels in both Hiroshima and Taichung. We're always open to looking at lots of different ways to optimize the business for the shareholders. Having said that, we like our NAND position. We like the technology, the early feedback from the customers is they like what we're doing. They like not only the 3D technology, but the product portfolio. And we think we're making progress. So we are encouraged with the progress we've been making. Yes, we have admitted for 18 months now that we completely missed the boat on planar TLC. We think we've taken significant steps to remedy that on a go-forward basis and we intend to do so. So we're going to play it out and as we do that, we'll look at lots of different strategic options for the DRAM business just like we do for the NAND business. Just like we do for the DRAM business and 3D cost point and all of the other interesting new technologies we're developing. Well I think we'll just keep those to ourselves, Mehdi. But I think the main point I would want to make is we think it's important to have a diversified set of products or technologies to support memory system solutions for our customers. We think we're in a strong position there. We like the growth profile associated with non-volatile memory business generally and that includes not only NAND, not only the 3D XPoint business that we're currently developing, but also other advanced storage class memories we're working in. And we'll look at lots of different ways of optimizing the value in all those different technologies. And we may find different solutions and different segments, but we're always looking for those opportunities to create value-added partnerships or new relationships. I think that it's reasonable to think about inventories being within a pretty narrow band for a couple of quarters. I think that's a reasonable thing to think about. And obviously, we pay a lot of attention to working capital and intend to do so on a going forward basis. And my statement about inventories was on a dollar basis, so obviously bits are going to move around as costs move around. Operator, I think we have time for one more question. No, there's no change. I think that we're pretty consistent. The fiscal Q1 is our crossover, is aligned with our crossover in the fall that we talked about today, which is a little earlier than we had originally talked about. The 3D crossover comes a little bit later and that drives a surge in the cost improvement but not necessary to drive the improvements that we've outlined relative to our guidance. The migration of DRAM from 20-nanometer to 1x? We're not completely done with 20-nanometer there yet, but as I mentioned a minute ago, we have 1x running there. It's where we've been doing our pilot line activity and we've transitioned or we've transferred then that technology into the Taichung fab and they are progressing with that. We wouldn't expect to see volume starts in either LPO or Taichung until later this year. Thank you, everyone.","Yes, hello, guys. Just a couple of questions here on the DRAM side. Obviously, a good bit growth there. But what's the mix of 20-nanometer that is shipping now and how do you see that as you progress through the August quarter? Do you see further cost reductions there? Thanks. I have one follow-up. Got it. And on the 3D NAND, on the NAND side obviously, looks like bit growth was a little light obviously because of the transition. What's your mix of 3D NAND that you're shipping now and when do you see the transition and the bit growth start to open up for you on the NAND side? Got it, and obviously, you guys are giving the point estimate to me on the gross margin now which is great. As you look at your mix, the 20-nanometer cost coming down and 3D NAND TLC starting to ship, any thoughts on where you see those margins start to bottom out? Thanks. Great, thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Ernie, maybe a follow on to that margin question, and I appreciate that margins are a function of pricing which is hard to predict. But you've got a lot of elements moving in the right direction. Revenue is growing sequentially into the fiscal fourth quarter. You've got 20-nanometer mix. You've got more mobile. NAND is starting to turn your way. And yet, you've got gross margins that are likely going to be down sequentially. Can you help me understand just some of the factors around mix that are in play? And the narrative that we were hoping for is that this quarter, the May quarter, and the August quarter, would start to show some tangible evidence of you closing the relative cost gap to some of your peers. And just given the gross margin guidance, it looks like that's not happening and I'm trying to figure out why. That's helpful, Mark. I appreciate it. And then, Ernie, maybe as my follow-on just on the OpEx guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. A little bit higher than we thought. Can you help us understand, are there some period expenses that are coming in? And then as you talk about the restructuring and the cost savings, given that you have that cost gap and you have a lot of initiatives on your plate for investing, how do we get comfortable that you're taking costs out of the right areas and yet still investing in areas you need to invest? Perfect. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Yes, thanks. Mark, you mentioned that channel pricing has improved. At what point would you start to see that show up in contract and in some of your other businesses? Because it looks like just based on the guidance for August that you're not expecting the overall pricing environment to (technical difficulties). Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the prequal expenses that are boosting OpEx this quarter, is that more one-time in nature or do you expect expenses to remain elevated through the course of the year as you ramp these new products? Okay, thank you. Thanks a lot. I guess I had two questions. First of all, the NAND bits are really moving around a lot, obviously given the planar to the 3D move. So maybe you can hold our hand a little bit, A, on the 3D transition, because it does look like there's been some issues in the 3D transition looking at the bits. And maybe also talk about what the bit outlook is for August in NAND to just give us some comfort that you're getting through this transition. Got it. And then just as the follow-up to that. Ernie, you talked at the Analyst Day, I think you said that $800 million of the CapEx this year would be for fab shell spending. So that net of the partner contribution you'd be in the $4 billion to $4.5 billion range. So sorry -- net of the partner contribution and also net of the fab shell spend, you'd be in the $4 billion to $4.5 billion range. So I'm just wondering as you look to next year and I'm not asking for guidance, but I'm just wondering how you think about the maintenance CapEx level of the Company given some of these initiatives you have in DRAM and also in 3D NAND? How do you think about how to balance that? Thanks. Got it. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. For the second generation 3D NAND, when you hit crossover in the fall for 3D NAND, will this all be on second generation technology or will it be first generation? And what's the difference in layer count between first and second generation, please? Great, thanks. Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess first of all, building on David's question. As you're seeing 3D ramp across the industry, how do you view your competitive positioning? At your Analyst Day, you laid out some beliefs that you were going to have cost leadership. Is that holding as you're seeing the competition ramp? Okay, and I guess to the harder question. What needs to happen for you guys to get back to sustained profitability? I applaud the restructuring efforts, but I look at the savings you've announced and that falls short of the losses you put up the last two quarters and what you guided to the next quarter. Are you confident these changes are going to be enough to get you back to profitability next year? Thanks, much. Thanks for taking my question. On the mobile side, as you start getting more qualification on the LP DDR3 and DDR4, are you expecting that -- I guess what percentage of your revenue will be those products versus EMCP and what is it today? Okay, maybe as you ship more of the LP DDR3 and 4s, are you expecting that your average selling price would increase? Okay, great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. First question on the mobility qualification side. How much is the uncertainty around timing there, whether it's the month of August or September/October, impacting your gross margin guide? And then as part of that, how should we think about the incremental gross margins as you start selling down your inventory going forward once we do get the qualified? Okay, that's helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, when you think about your 3D NAND cost structure, curious how you would compare that today versus the price leader in planar NAND and when you think you'll crossover? Is that gen one when you're fully ramped at high volume or is that more gen two in the summertime next year? Great. Thanks, Mark. Hello, thank you. I just wanted to clarify when you talk about Q4 DRAM bit growth being better than Q3, that's sequential bit growth north of 20%. And I guess that then implies when you look at revenue not growing very much that ASPs are down similarly. I know you don't want to give a pricing forecast, but I just want to make sure I understand. I'm finding it hard to get to your revenue number with my pricing assumptions. Okay, and then separately, can you talk about how the Inotera, the new pricing agreement factors into this? Is that a positive or a negative at this point relative to the old pricing agreement? And maybe if you could compare that versus a wholly-owned situation if that deal in fact moves through? Just any context you can give us around that dynamic? Got it. Okay, thank you. Hello, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm still a little bit unclear as to the gross margin decline or the slight gross margin decline in the August quarter, given that we've seen some stabilization in DRAM and NAND prices starting in the month of June. Your 20-nanometer mix and your 3D NAND mix is moving higher, so would assume that your blended costs are coming down nicely. You mentioned other parts of the market that may not be participating on the pricing stabilization that we're seeing in the PC market, but if I look at the end market demand parameters, data center, networking fundamentals seem to be improving into the second half. Embedded fundamentals seem to be seasonally up. Can you guys just articulate what segments are still showing aggressive pricing declines? Okay, appreciate the insights there. Maybe more of a product question for me next. If we include two in ones, SSD and embedded NAND attach rates and notebook PCs are at or slightly above 50% now and continuing to climb. I think you guys had a target of having your 3D NAND base client SSD in the market in calendar Q3. Maybe if you can give us an update there? And I think you guys also had a target to have your 3D NAND-based SATA solution, your high capacity drives for hyper scale guys, starting in calendar Q4. If you could give us an update there as well? Thanks. Great, thank you. Yes, thanks for taking my question. On the whole 3D NAND conversion, I just wanted to get a better understanding of in your estimation, what would be more cost effective, the 3D on 32 layer versus the 20-nanometer that's currently on 2D NAND? But can you give us an idea in terms of if your 3D NAND is actually fitted for some of the applications will be available for applications such as mobile or embedded or car? Okay and just last question on the mobile DRAM qualification issues. What specifically can you talk about? Has there been quality issues with respect to your mobile DRAM, which is preventing you from getting qualified at certain customers and as a result losing market share to Samsung and --? And if I can squeeze one more. In terms of competitively as it relates to your other major competitor moving to a smaller process node, and you guys perhaps perpetually playing catch up in terms of the profit node transition. What are some of the lessons you think you guys have understood from the 20-nanometer transition and trying to rectify that when you go to the other process node transition? Just in general, any comments there would be helpful. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Yes, thanks for taking my question. Mark, just looking at your NAND gross margin. It's been below corporate average since mid-2013, and you have all of these new product qualifications coming up. I'm just wondering is there strategic alternative here to make a more dramatic or to take a more dramatic action? Because there's been more than two years that NAND has been underperforming compared to the corporate average. And in case these product qualifications don't go well, is there an alternative strategy here? And I have a follow-up. Any way you could share with us qualitatively or big picture what those options are? Got it and then quickly for Ernie, how should we think about working capital inventory and accounts receivable? It seems like, at least on an inventory side, it may not come down significantly until February quarter. Is that a fair assumption or not? Okay, thank you. Hello, good afternoon. You've mentioned on the call today that the 3D NAND cost structure is laying to the TLC mix and you've mentioned a two quarter out timeframe for that mix ramp. Is that even on with the fiscal Q4 target in terms of cost improvement in your NAND difference that you provided last quarter? Or is there a little bit of a change in terms of where you expect an inflection point in your cost structure and NAND flash? Okay, and then just as a quick follow-up, any steps that you can talk about that you're taking to accelerate the node migration at Elpida? That's right, yes. Great, thank you.

Thank you, Ivan. For our second quarter FY16, Micron posted total revenue of $2.93 billion with gross margin of 20%, non-GAAP net loss of $48 million, and a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.05, all within our guided range. Operating cash flow was $763 million. Our results were impacted by continued weakness in the PC market, seasonality, and timing of product launches in certain market segments. We are simultaneously ramping, qualifying, and delivering several leading edge products including 20 nanometer DDR4, low-power DDR4, and 3D NAND-based solutions. Our progress has been strong, but is always challenging to precisely align technology conversions and fab output, with customer qualification cycles and market seasonality. Today, I'd like to provide a high level overview of our progress in each of the business units, and have asked Ernie to cover business unit metrics and financial performance. In our compute and networking business unit, we recently achieved initial customer qualifications of our 20-nanometer 8 gigabit DDR4 products. These are now ramping in volume. In the enterprise, we have qualified an innovative NVDIMM solution at two major OEMs. In the graphics segment, we are enthusiastic about the early success of our GDDR5X, a discreet solution for increasing data rates above 10 gigabits per second. We have several major design wins, and expect to have the product available by the end of the current fiscal quarter. In the networking segment, we are seeing early signs of demand recovery in China, where we believe our broad portfolio and strong customer engagements position us well for the future. Turning to our mobile business units, results have been negatively impacted by the timing of product qualifications, as we transition customers to 20-nanometer versions of LPDDR4 products. We do expect to finalize 20-nanometer low-power DDR4 qualifications with most customers by the end of this quarter. And this, coupled with our expectation that memory demand across the smartphone categories will continue to expand, leaves us confident that our mobile business is well-positioned for substantial growth by the fourth fiscal quarter of this year. In our embedded business unit, automotive design-in activity remains strong, particularly with 20-nanometer DDR3 and low-power DDR4 products. We are seeing growth with automotive customers in greater Asia, and continuing to build upon success with European and US manufacturers. We are also generating strong design-in activity for our industrial SSDs, and we are delivering a broad portfolio of differentiated non-volatile memory DRAM and MCP solutions for the consumer and connected home segments. Finally, our storage business unit has been positioning its product portfolio to take advantage of our high performance 3D NAND technology. We are currently sampling Tier 1 OEMs with early versions of our 3D NAND-enabled PCIe NVMe client SSDs. Over the next two quarters, we will be shipping Crucial-branded low cost 3D NAND client SSDs, high performance drives targeting gaming enthusiasts, and a 2 terabyte client OEM drive. In summary, the leading edge technology deployment is progressing well across manufacturing for both DRAM and NAND, and our bit growth and cost reduction targets are on track. We believe the combination of new products, with more efficient manufacturing on advanced nodes will drive significant improvement in Micron's relative competitive position in the second half of 2016 and beyond. Turning to the memory industry more generally, we believe that DRAM industry bit supply will decrease to the low to mid 20% range in 2016, and could drop below 20% in 2017. Our estimate is based on slowing technology-driven supply growth, and no incremental wafer supply. Although the current environment remains challenging, we believe -- we continue to believe that longer term DRAM bit demand growth in the low to mid 20% range will result in healthy market fundamentals. For NAND, we estimate 2016 industry bit supply growth in the mid to high 30% range, as early 3D conversions create some temporary supply constraints. We continue to expect the cost and performance advantages of 3D NAND will drive enhanced adoption rates and densities across key storage markets, and we are confident in Micron's road map in 3D NAND in terms of timing, performance, and relative cost position. Internally, and from an operations perspective, Micron remains focused on a few key operating priorities. For DRAM, we continue ramping 20-nanometer. This technology node will represent more than 50% of our fab bit output in the current fiscal quarter. We are enabling 1X DRAM in manufacturing, and recently began transferring this technology to our Taiwan fab in Taichung. We expect to ramp 1X nanometer in volume starting in FY17. We are still forecasting our own FY16 and 2017 DRAM bit growth CAGR in the 20% to 30% range. This is likely above the market. Our current year bit growth will be weighted to the second half of FY16, with substantial bit production output gains in fiscal Q3 and Q4. We currently have no plans to add DRAM wafer capacity, so any market share growth in DRAM will be the result of technology deployment. For NAND, we are ramping gen 1 3D NAND in Singapore, and expect to have more than 50% of our NAND bit fab bit output on 3D by the fall of 2016. We are also enabling gen 2 3D in manufacturing, and expect to be in early production starting this summer. We are forecasting Micron's FY16 and 2017 NAND bit growth CAGR in the 30% to 40% range. We expect to be below the market in 2016, but well above the market in 2017. Most of this growth will be related to 3D and TLC conversions, which will begin to deliver more substantial bit growth and cost reductions, starting late in FY17-- FY16, excuse me. We are planning for incremental capacity with our Singapore fab expansion, and are beginning tool installations this quarter. As always, we continue to be mindful of market conditions as we contemplate our investment decisions. Relative to 3D [cross point], we are working with market enablers, and continue to believe this innovative technology will be a strong contributor to Micron's future success. We continue to augment our controller and subsystem capabilities, and have made good progress in aligning this road map with our 3D NAND RAM. We expect to substantially expand our vertically integrated solutions over the next 12 months. Now I would like to turn it over to Ernie. Thank you, Mark. Before sharing our normal financial summary, I'll cover more technology and business unit details. DRAM represented 54% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile was in the low 20% range. The PC segment was in the mid 20% range. The server business was in the low 20% range, and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies was in the high 20% range. In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented [37]% of total revenue, with the following segmentation. Consumer, which includes our memory cards, USB and components, represented more than 50%. Mobile, including MCP, was in the low teens percent range, while SSDs were in the mid teens percent range. Automotive and industrial multi-market segment and other embedded applications were in the mid teens percent range. Moving on, I'll share a brief operational summary of each of our business units. First, CNBU. The compute and network business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.05 billion, down 8% from the previous quarter, impacted by lower average selling prices, and continued softness in demand from the PC segment. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $55 million, or 5%. Our [high] value solutions to enterprise, networking and graphics markets helped to offset some of this weakness. In the enterprise and cloud segment, we continued to see significant demand for our DDR4 solutions. Specifically within the cloud segment, we had record DDR4 shipments increasing our market share with key hyperscale customers in Asia-Pacific. Within the enterprise segment, demand for our 32 gigabyte DDR4 RDIMM also gained significant traction with key customers. In graphics, we continued to see demand softness, however, second half demand looks stronger for products such as our 20-nanometer 8-gig GDDR5 solution. In networking, we also saw a slowdown in demand, as a result of lower LTE shipments during the quarter, but we are expecting a recovery in the second half of the year. Finally, within the client segment, we achieved successful enablement and volume ramp of our 20-nanometer 4 gigabit DDR3 solutions. Also, we shipped samples of our 20-nanometer 8-gigabit DDR4 solution to all major OEMs, and began high volume production. Micron's mobile business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $503 million, down 40% from the prior quarter, due to delayed customer qualifications, and pricing pressure in the eMCP market. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $21 million, or 4% of revenue. We expect some continued challenges during fiscal Q3, as we conclude our customer qualifications, but expect to see improved shipments during our fourth fiscal quarter. Bit shipments of eMCPs were down approximately 25%, as we redirected bits to higher value homes. We saw strong LPDDR3 demand from China in mid tier phones, and expect this demand will continue into next year. Looking forward, our mobile portfolio continues to position us for growth and success. While we had some missteps in our mobile qualifications in [F] Q2, we expect this situation to progressively improve during the calendar year. We continue to ramp our LPDDR4 solutions into both the flagship and high end segments, and will be introducing our innovative 3D NAND into flagships, and some higher end phones in the second half of calendar 2016. The embedded business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $460 million, down 4% from the previous quarter with a non-GAAP operating income of $87 million, or 19% of revenue. The results were primarily impacted by softness in demand from the consumer and industrial multi-market segments, offset by continued strength in the automotive segment. Looking ahead, we continue to see increasing demand in both DRAM and e.MMC for automotive application that includes infotainment, instrument cluster, and advanced driver assistance systems. In addition, our NOR [XTRMFlash] product introduced last quarter continues to gain adoption with key chipset and system-on-chip venders within the automotive ecosystem. Our industrial multi-market segment, we are seeing good design-in activity of our M500IT industrial SSDs and specialty DRAM. And in the connected home segment, we are seeing increased DRAM demand from key set-top-box customers in both Asia and North America. Micron's storage business unit posted fiscal Q2 revenue of $901 million, up 2% from the previous quarter, with a non-GAAP operating loss of $18 million, which represents 2% of revenue. We continue to optimize our product mix to address market challenges, particularly in the client and data center SSD segments. Our trade NAND component bit growth was up 16% quarter-over-quarter, and we see demand increasing, driven by OEM enterprise solution providers and web scale customers who want to leverage the energy savings and performance gain enabled by Micron Flash. In our client and consumer SSD segment, consecutive quarter bit growth was up 13%, reflecting accelerated SSD adoption in OEM Ultrabook and Ultrathin PCs. In our enterprise SSD segment, we are starting to ship our S600 series SAS drive, Micron's first product produced through our strategic partnership with Seagate. We expect to realize revenue from this new product line in Q3, as we move into volume production. Finally, the data center SSD market segment saw significant downward pricing pressure, driven by TLC-enabled competitors and aggressive competition for hyperscale business. Micron's participation in this market has been measured, and in the second quarter, we strategically shifted bit supply from this segment to more favorable market -- margin opportunities. Looking at the Company overall, as Mark noted earlier, revenue for the second quarter was $2.93 billion, which is at the low end of our guided range. Our revenues were impacted by seasonality, timing of product launches, and DRAM and NAND pricing pressure driven primarily by the PC end market. Gross margin for the quarter was 20%, 5 percentage points below the previous quarter, and at the high end of our guidance. The non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter was $48 million, or $0.05 per share, at the favorable end of our guided range. Gross margin reflects the pricing environment noted earlier, as well as the timing of our leading edge technology migrations. As we've noted before, these migrations will generate more substantial cost per bit reductions, starting in fiscal Q3 for DRAM and fiscal Q4 for NAND. As a reminder, Micron includes both amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock compensation expense in our non-GAAP reporting. Taken together, these two items represent $0.06 per share for the recently completed quarter. Looking at results by product line, DRAM revenue decreased 18% compared to the first fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of lower average selling prices, and lower volume shipments. During the second quarter, DRAM bit inventories increased as a result of the 20-nanometer ramp, and the timing of product qualifications with certain mobile customers. While we currently expect substantial growth in the volume of DRAM sales in Q3, we also expect an additional inventory increase that will become available for incremental revenue during the following quarters. The further market adoption of DDR4 products continued in the second quarter, and represented approximately 26% of total DRAM volume sales. As a result of decreases in average selling prices, DRAM gross margin was lower than in our previous quarter at approximately 20%, while bit costs remain relatively flat. Our non-volatile trade revenue decreased 6% compared to the first quarter, as a result of the decrease in selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volume. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points, as improvement in per bit costs nearly offset the decrease in selling prices. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter came in at $583 million, slightly below the midpoint of our guided range. The Company generated operating cash flow of $763 million during the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $5.1 billion. Expenditures for PP&E during the quarter were $1.2 billion, and we continue to expect our FY16 capital expenditures to be in the $5 billion range, net of partner contributions. During the second quarter, we borrowed approximately $425 million with equipment financing, and also repaid the third installment on the former Elpida creditor debt, bringing the total repayment to approximately half of the total debt. Moving now to our third fiscal quarter guidance. On the non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: consolidated revenue in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion, gross margin in the range of 16.5% to 19%, operating expenses between $560 million and $610 million, operating income ranging between a loss of $70 million and income of $10 million and an EPS range between a loss of $0.12 per share and a loss of $0.05 per share based on 1.036 billion shares. Operationally, we are on track to achieve the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets outlined in our recent Analyst Day. Along these lines, we expect strong double-digit bit growth and related cost reductions for DRAM in fiscal Q3, as a result of the deployment of our 20-nanometer technology. These trends will continue in future quarters, along with the benefits of expected improvements in seasonality, and further progress on our product qualifications. Our 3D NAND ramp in manufacturing is proceeding well, and we expect to see significant bit growth and cost reductions starting in fiscal Q4.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Thank you, Ernie. There is one additional thing I would like to mention, before opening up the call for questions. As you know, Mark Adams resigned for health reasons at the beginning of the year. Rather than directly replacing his role, we have decided to make, and are in the process of implementing some changes to our organizational structure, that we believe will effectively ensure our ongoing competitiveness. To summarize, we continue to navigate challenging market conditions, and we are working to match the timing of our leading edge output, with the right mix of customers and end markets. We remain confident in the long-term health of the industry, and our strategy to improve our relative competitive position. Operator, we are now ready to begin Q&A.","No, we don't expect to do anything on the utilization front. And we think the substantial majority of the inventory will be worked through in the fourth fiscal quarter, with maybe a little bit carrying over into Q1, but we don't foresee anything beyond that. I think, if you accept that the cost reductions are on track with what we articulated in our Analyst Day, really it sort of boils down to what your assumption is relative to the pricing environment. And certainly, we've embedded certain assumptions in our guided range, and really want to make sure that we're communicating that the issue relates to an assumption around the pricing environment, and not the realization of the cost reduction of the Company. Yes. So first, relative to the qualifications, obviously, when you're ramping multiple new fabs on new technology nodes, and simultaneously transitioning to new densities and new IOs, it's a complicated thing to keep everything completely aligned with all the various customer requirements and customer product rollouts, particularly in a design-in, more sticky environment like we experienced in the mobile segment. So really what we experienced is more of a timing issue, relative to some of those products at some of those customers, and we're very confident that the product meets their needs. It's just a matter of now getting them queued up, and through the qualification cycle. So I'm very, very confident that, that we have a good handle on the timing. And that's why we continue to build those products, and are confident in holding an amount of inventory to cover that. Relative to the client SSDs, you're right, there's been significant pressure there. We have talked about strong double-digit growth, in terms of our bit growth on NAND on a go-forward basis, and given that, the significant cost reductions that come with that, as well as the strong ability to ramp TLC as we move late into the year with our 3D NAND. So generally speaking, we feel pretty good about where our NAND business goes, as we move late into this year and into the next year. I'm not going to predict anything relative to ASPs or margins, but I do feel very confident that our 3D NAND ramp and TLC ramp are as predicted, with the associated cost gains that you would expect, and that we've previously discussed. Yes. So you're correct, that some of these new IOs have a die size penalty associated with them. It's a mix of anywhere between 0% and 8%, 9%, 10%, depending on the density and the form factor. I would say that the mix shift that we see is, yes, we will continue to see, as we move through the year, some increase in the growth in the mix, relative to these mobile IDs. Generally speaking, we're also going to see growth in the server segment as well. So generally speaking, we've given you this all-in bit growth guidance of 15% to 25% CAGR over the next couple of years. And that includes the mix effects that we currently anticipate in our business, and I think we're fairly confident in terms of our ability to understand. If you look at the guidance we provided for F Q2, and what we provided for F Q3, they are not too dissimilar to one another. And if you look at the CapEx discussion we just had, where we're saying we're still on track to spend about $5 billion. And clearly, we've reported on the first half of the year in terms of CapEx spend, I think you have all the information you need to understand within a reasonable estimable range, what the cash flow environment will likely look like for the third fiscal quarter. No, because if you think about the reverse, let's say they weren't going higher. You would have expected those to sell through into the revenue line, which would have effectively increased the cash flow vis-a-vis the prior quarter. So the fact that we -- the guidance does really contemplate, if you follow the guide posts I've just provided to you, they'll get you to a pretty good estimate of what is likely to happen on cash flow for the quarter. Well, I'm probably not -- it varies greatly depending on model obviously. You would think in terms of all-in memory growth, and we think it can be up to $90, $100 a car. The automotive business has been pretty strong for us. And it's also, we view it as an attractive business, because the sockets are pretty sticky, the lifetimes of the products are longer. And so, from a total return, it's a very positive market for us. I think it's very similar to the answer, of one of the earlier questions, which is we are very confident, and provided some pretty clear visibility into what we think is happening with the cost structure. And as I said earlier, we all have an assumption set around what's going to happen in the pricing environment. And so, depending on your assumption about that -- and we certainly have taken a view that suggests that you're going to continue to see some of the pressure that we've seen over the recent quarters. So the, the gross margin guide is very, very centered around an ASP assumption, versus any doubt about our ability to achieve our cost reductions. I'm not sure I said that I thought it would improve at all. So I don't think I went there. And as a result of that, I think I said we expect to see continued pricing pressure. And certainly, if you think about our discussion around our inventory build, and that being in the mobile business, and the mobile typically being at the upper end of the gross margin continuum, rather than the PC segment, it does help explain some of the thinking that went into our gross margin guide for the quarter. So there is always a mix piece of the equation that may vary from competitor to competitor. But if you set that aside, I think we've outlined that we think our bit growth and our cost downs, particularly in DRAM starting in Q3, and in NAND later in the quarter, are going to be significant relative to what you would expect for an industry average. And that's really what drives the fundamental equation, relative to relative competitive position, irrespective of what market conditions might look like. Well, we had significant bit growth in NAND in the quarter, and typically you would expect that cost reduction associated with that. On the DRAM side, while we did, I think, experience a measure of success relative to the progress we made on our 20-nanometer, and the placement of those products with customers, there is a mix impact that is somewhat of a headwind related to the type of memory, and in particular, LPDDR4 and DDR4 versus LPDDR3 and DDR3, that is a headwind relative to bit growth. We will overwhelm that as we move through the next couple of quarters, as we've talked about, but that has been a little bit of a headwind. And then, when you layer on top of that some of the inventory growth in high margin products -- or what are higher margin products, typically the mobile piece of the business, that was somewhat of a headwind relative to the cost reduction for DRAM in the current quarter. No. In particular, the inventory that we're holding has primarily been around timing of product qualifications. And while there is a mix of different types of products in that inventory, I wouldn't direct you to the compute market in particular. In fact, I would say that the mobile is more significant piece of that. Let me just add -- additionally, it's -- we're not taking what we think is any significant risk here. These are products that we have high confidence are going to sell through, and are pretty fungible among customers. We're not going to forecast the May quarter pricing for you (laughter). We -- no matter how many different ways we go at it, Tim, unfortunately, we can't tell you that. But what we can tell you, we're pretty comfortable with our cost downs and our bit growth, being along the lines of what we previously forecast to you, and we're very comfortable with the way everything's progressing in manufacturing. So yes, you've got to take that last little piece, and plug it in yourself. Yes, and I'd add to that, Tim, that it's important to remember that we've always looked at NAND cost reduction, as more of a Q4 event with DRAM in Q3. And if you, again, couple that with the color we've provided around inventory, and that being predominantly attributable to one of the higher margin segments, I think you'll find that if you triangulate around all of this, it's pretty easy to understand that what we're saying around cost reduction, is in fact reality. Sure. So obviously, with the change in the market, since the time we've talked about the acquisition, the benefits, whether you assume it's the new arrangement or the full consolidation, are actually more muted. We still believe that they are positive, but significantly more muted than the time when we originally announced things. And we would expect from a handicapping point of view, F Q1 would be the first time you'd see the big uplift, and the impacts that we have previously talked about, relative to margin accretion starting in the third quarter, have obviously changed as a result of the change in the market environment. Yes, not a whole lot to communicate on that yet, other than we have started early silicon in the fab in Taichung. And it's a process that we don't believe will result in any significant volume on 110 -- on what we call 110 series, our 1X nanometer node until we get into 2017. That's moving along as we expected. So there's no new news from the last time that we shared things publicly. Yes, it is still $5 billion net of partner contribution. The -- we ended up in a slightly different place, relative to what we sold through relative to mobile. That is fair to say. Relative to mobile pricing, down mid single-digits in the quarter we finished. We continue to focus around our costs and our cost competitiveness. We really don't get in the business of forecasting margins, because there's a pricing environment piece of that, which we have very little control over. So we can talk clearly about what we think is going to happen on the cost front. We've done that. I'm happy to reiterate that, but margins is not something we're in the business of doing. Well, we've talked about being over 50% 3D NAND in the fall. And so, if you want more precision than that, probably not ready to go there yet, other than to say, we continue to be very happy with the way that technology is rolling out in manufacturing. We're very satisfied with the quality, and our ability to apply TLC versions of our 3D NAND, and that will provide an added boost really later in the fall, and into the beginning of 2017. Well, it's -- I don't think I've got anything really new to say about that. I think we've said before, that we anticipated that clearly China was interested in being in the memory market, and that they would look for ways to find partners or to grow organically. We've now heard about significant investments in organic growth. But we would remind everyone that we believe that there's significant technology hurdles, and intellectual property requirements in terms of being a major player in the memory space. And we think it's going to be a challenging road for the -- for organic, and it will take some time. Yes. It's -- well, first of all, you're right. This year we're in enablement mode, and we're working with a number of different end market segments. Some customers in -- have significant interest in mobile. Some customers in enterprise for Big Data applications, some in mobile for low-power, some of the low-power benefits. Early on, as we ramp this technology, we expect cannibalization to be low to zero. Over time, as the technology matures and drives to significantly higher volumes, I would expect some of that volume to come out of what otherwise would have been DRAM, and maybe even eventually what otherwise would have been other types of non-volatile memory. But generally speaking, this is a differentiated technology that will grow the size of the overall memory market at least over the next two, three, four years. Yes. So we don't give you bit growth projections for either production or sales anymore, since we're now guiding all the financial numbers. But I think that the broader interpretation of your question is, why are we confident we're going to have the bit growth that we're baking into our models? And the answer there is, we're now a month into the quarter. So a significant part of the output is already out, and another significant part of the output is already running in the fab. We've seen a month of yield data already. And I would just reinforce what we said on our last Analyst Day presentation that the ramp is really -- at that time was, and continues to outperform any previous new technology ramp in terms of yield maturity. And so, we just really like the way it's going. We're seeing strong progress in two fabs in parallel, and we're highly confident that we're going to deliver on the bit growth, and associated cost improvements that we forecast to you previously. Well, what we've said is that over a -- the CAGR that we provided which is 2016 and 2017, that we are looking at somewhere in the realm of 25% cost downs versus 20-nanometer. That's more of a cash cost down. And that if you take total costs all-in including depreciation, which we will encounter to a higher degree, a 20-nanometer versus what we encountered at 25-nanometer, we're looking at somewhere between 15% and 25%. So it will -- obviously, in the early days, it will be less. But as we get and ramp to mature yields, you'll expect to see somewhere right in the center of that range. So we have planer TLC NAND in the marketplace today. But I think we commented earlier that the SSD, the client SSD and consumer SSD market has been fairly challenged from a pricing perspective. And so, we've been measured in terms of how we approach that end market. I think the more important thing is that, yes, we believe that as we move to 3D NAND, a very significant percentage of our output will eventually become 3D, and that just drives a significant cost reduction above and beyond the conversion to 3D itself. So we actually already have gen 2 in a manufacturing fab. What I commented on, was that we would start early production in the summer. So we have -- we actually have product running through a manufacturing fab today on gen 2, and obviously, like the way that's going as well. As to the equipment set, it's not identical, but it is similar equipment. In some cases, more of it, but very, very similar tools. We don't have any plans to cut production today (multiple speakers) you could talk, you could see if others do. I don't know. Well, I think -- well, first of all, we're not going to do it unless we see negative cash margins, because we haven't added any incremental capacity. And we think we would be foolish to be the first ones to take capacity off, given that fact set. Yes. It's important to remember how much of our cost structure is fixed. And so, to Mark's point, as long as we're getting a contribution to that cost structure, that fixed cost structure, it's a really ill-advised move to be unilaterally cutting production. So the other thing I think, just to temper the assumption in your question, DRAM CapEx is going to be down about 30% this year. So I don't think it's necessarily all doom and gloom. As we look at what we think supply growth is going to be going forward, and what we think demand growth is segment by segment, we already gave you our opinion, which is it's going to take a little bit of time, but we think that this is going to be a healthy environment again. Yes, our focus isn't on market share. Our focus is on making sure that we have deployed equivalent advanced technology, at least equivalent advanced technology to our competitors, so we that are not incentivizing others to play for market share. And we think that that's really just a prudent thing to do as managers of our business. That we should make sure that we're putting in place efficient manufacturing production capacity, and that's what we're very, very focused on. Yes, that comment was really specific to the networking segment of our CNBU business. And we're starting to see a little bit more activity there, maybe early parts of next generation infrastructure roll out. We would expect that to continue for a number of years. No. We still think that the range that we provided is accurate over that time frame. The industry, we think will be less than 20%, in terms of industry bit growth. That's as a result of deploying advanced technology, not adding wafers, or targeting some specific market share. And, operator, it looks like we've got one more question, then we'll be done. All right. So I'll take the first two, and then I'll let Ernie come back to the Inotera financing. Relative to PCs, yes, it continues to be weak. We think it maybe down mid single-digits for the year. DRAM content may be up about 10% for the year. We're not expecting any big things out of PC demand, when we give you our view as to the demand growth for the year across all the various segments. But once you get outside of PCs growing obviously slower than overall market supply for DRAM, and mobile growing maybe right around the market supply for DRAM, you got all of these other segments that we think will outstrip supply growth, servers, automotive, et cetera, et cetera. So generally speaking, we do believe that in aggregate, things are going to take care of themselves. Relative to mobile inventory, again, it's primarily -- there's a mix of things in inventory. But we did indicate that, yes, a chunk of it is mobile. And a lot of that just revolves around timing and product qualifications that we have high confidence in. We're just building inventory in advance of those qualifications, and so that we're prepared to ship that product out, when the qualifications come through. And Ernie, do you want to take Inotera? Sure. Again, similar to what we said before, we're looking at a wide variety of options for that remaining $1 billion. And as the time to close approaches, we'll be looking at the alternatives that make the most sense to us, given where we are at the time. All right. I want to thank everyone for their participation on the call today, and for their continued interest in Micron. Obviously, I'm still bullish on the memory industry. I like the way we're executing. And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Ivan to close us up. Thanks, Mark. If you'll just bear with me, I have to reread the Safe Harbor language real quickly. I need to -- let's see. During the course of this call, we may have made forward-looking statements regarding the Company and the industry. These particular forward-looking statements, and all other statements that may have been made on the call that are not historical facts, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. For information on the important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our filings with the SEC, including the Company's most recent 10-Q and 10-K. Thank you again.","Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. First question is on the inventory, which I know Ernie, you talked about increasing this quarter, then potentially again next quarter. Can you just talk about how you expect to work down inventory going forward, and if you need to do anything on the utilization front, in order to manage the inventory levels? Okay. Then for a follow-up on the gross margin outlook for next quarter, can you just help us better understand some of the mechanics that are driving the decline, and if any color between the different segments of how gross margins might trend? Thank you very much. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just provide a little more color on the qualifications on the mobile side? Any issues as to why you missed a window, and why it won't penalize you maybe for more than a couple of quarters? And then secondly, just on the client SSD business, if I look at numbers in terms of pricing in the last three months or so, you're seeing pretty sharp ASP declines on average for client SSDs. And I'm just curious, given I know -- I understand the cost basis is going down, but relative to those cost declines, how close are you to coming to acceptable margins, once you get through the technology transition? Thanks. Okay. So just to be clear, the costs, you still feel like the cost reductions can -- obviously, those margins aren't going to be above average, but you feel like you can get into an acceptable range and ramp volumes in there, by the fourth fiscal quarter, is that fair to say? Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Yes, thanks for taking my question. Mark, as you look into the second half, especially with the mix shift that's shifting more towards mobile and server DRAM, how should we think about the die penalty, and increased DRAM bits that are coming from your migration to 20-nanometer? You do get a better cost decline, but there's also a mix shift that carries a die penalty. And I'm just trying to better understand those dynamics. And I have a follow-up. Sure. And then, one question for Ernie, as you go through these inventory adjustments, is there any color you can provide on how we should think about the free cash flow? I know you don't want to comment on margin, but your working capital requirement is going up. Should we assume the cash burn is going to decrease or increase from the just reported quarter, or any other color that you can provide? But you just said that your inventories are going to go higher. I'm just -- would that imply that your operating cash is going to be less, compared to the February quarter? Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. It seems the automotive market has some good growth in it. Can you give us an idea of what content, what DRAM content can be in the automobile over the years? Okay. And would this be above corporate average gross margin, or where does it fit in on the gross margin curve? Okay. Thank you. Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of the gross margin guide. I'm trying to reconcile the fact that, as we progress throughout the year, you should be getting higher yields on 20-nanometer, and 20 nanometer should represent a higher percentage of the capacity, yet the margins are coming down 300-odd basis points. And so, if you could maybe help me reconcile that, the gross margin guide, relative to the cost reductions improving as you go throughout the year, that would be helpful? So why would you --  in the second half, calendar second half, what makes you optimistic that the pricing is going to -- or the overall DRAM environment is going to get better, and somehow lead to better DRAM pricing? And along those lines, can you talk a little bit about, why has the pricing been so weak the last several quarters, and why would it somehow abate going forward, if that's the case? Just last question, what is the basis of the comment, that you're going to improve your competitive position as you move throughout the second half of 2016? If, as you just acknowledged that the pricing environment, we don't know what is going to happen -- it could get worse, could get better -- why would your competitive positioning improve in the second half? All right. Thank you, sir. Hi. This is Farhan. I am asking the question on behalf of John. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is regarding the cost reductions that you just reported for DRAM and NAND. It seems like the NAND cost reductions were pretty significant. They came in at 12% quarter-on-quarter, whereas DRAM was somewhat less than what I would have thought, like the cost per bit actually went up. Can you talk about what drove the bit cost reduction in NAND? And also on DRAM, like why are we not seeing any benefit from the 20-nanometer transition yet? Got it. And then one question related to your inventories, like you are holding a little bit longer inventory. And given that the mix is such a big factor in, like on the mobile side, it seems like it's very specific to the products that you are designed in. Should we assume like most of the inventory you are holding mostly is going to be in the PC, or can you hold inventory in other segments of the market as well? Thank you. That's all I had. Thank you. Hi. Thanks a lot. I had a question on gross margin as well. But I guess, I'm just -- I want to make sure I have the right message from what you're saying. It sounds like that you're saying that, look, from the gross margin guidance, that it would appear that maybe you're not getting the cost downs, but in fact you are. It's just that pricing is basically overwhelming the cost downs in the May quarter. Is that the message? Got it. Thanks, Ernie. And then, just one more. So can you talk about Inotera? May is the first full quarter of the new agreement. Of course, you're in the process of buying them, but the market dynamics have changed a lot since you last talked about the impact. So can you maybe help us a little bit about handicapping what the impact of the change in the agreement is on the May quarter guidance? Okay. Thanks. Hi. This is [Ada] calling in for C.J. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the timing of the 1X nano ramp, and also the required CapEx there? Thank you. And in terms of the financing for the Inotera acquisition, any updates there? Thank you. Great. Thank you. I wanted to clarify one thing. On the slides, it says the capital expenditures is $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion net of the partner contribution. Is it still $5 billion net of partner contribution, is that right? Okay, great. And then with the mobile issue, is that something that you were able to anticipate? Did you know that three months ago, when you talked about the quarter, when you planned the fab, or did that surprise you over the course of the quarter? And what happened for like-for-like pricing in the mobile space, outside of that issue? Great. Thank you very much. Yes, hi, guys. Just looking at the May quarter, the softness in the gross margin side, when you -- as you ramp your 20-nanometer LPDDR4, once it gets qualified, let's say, and 3D NAND, do you expect the margins to improve once they start shipping? Obviously, most of it is (inaudible) in inventory now. Can you give us some color there? All right. And on the 3D NAND side, I guess, just looking at 3D NAND and LPDDR4, what do you expect the mix -- what is the mix here, and where do you see the mix, let's say, by exiting calendar 2016? Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. This is Justin calling on behalf Tristan Gerra. My first question would be, could you share your view on the recent memory investment from China? Okay. Thanks. My next question is regarding the 3D cross point that you will start to sell next year, which customers are you going to sell to? And how much cannibalization do you think it will bring to DRAM and NAND? Thank you. Yes, thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Mark. First, on the -- you heard on the DRAM side, the bit growth was substantially less in the last quarter. And you did say that in the fiscal third quarter, you are going to have a significant [chunk of it]. What gives you the confidence that you're going to be ramping successfully on that, given that the -- historically, that you've had some challenges on that? Can you just elaborate your conviction level, on what kind of step-up on the bit growth are we going to see in the second half, between calendar third quarter and fourth quarter, and then in 2017? Okay. Just on the cost reduction, how should we be thinking about in terms of, is it going to be -- how -- is there cost reduction for 20-nanometer going to be different from the cost reduction on the 25-nanometer? Can you just elaborate on that part? Or is it going to be similar? Okay. Thank you so much. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Had a couple on NAND flash, if I could. First is, I just wanted to review real quick the cost reduction strategy for SSD products, in particular, as (inaudible) mentioned TLC.  I just wanted to make sure, is that TLC 3D NAND, or were you referring to 2D planer TLC as well as part of the lower cost NAND that's going to go into SSD [later] this year? Got it. Thanks, Mark. And just as my follow-up, for the gen 2-3D NAND process that you mentioned will be going into -- going through the fabs a little bit later this summer, can you comment on whether the tool set for this gen 2 will be identical to gen 1 that's you're already outfitting in your fabs, or will it require some incremental spending on top of that? Thanks. Got it. Thank you. Yes, thanks. Just back to inventories, it just seems from my perspective that unless demand gets a lot better, pricing is going to continue to be weak until Micron and the DRAM industry overall cuts production. So my question is, what will it take for that to happen? Is your point that it's got to come from the market share leader first? The prevailing view a year ago, was that all the players in the DRAM industry were focused on maximizing profits. But today, the focus seems to be on market share. Mark, maybe you could just give us your perspective on what you think is happening in terms of competitive dynamics? Okay. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. So in your prepared comments, you talked about early signs of a demand recovery in China. Could you talk more about that? I'm assuming it excludes mobile, given some of the qualification issues. So largely networking then, okay. My follow-up is expectations for DRAM bit growth in FY17, under 20%. Has that thinking changed since the Analyst Day, because you did provide that two-year CAGR, 20% to 30% over two years. Do we go to the low end of the range, or could you go under that? Thanks for the clarification. So you're implying you could outgrow in FY17, outgrow the industry? Okay. Thank you. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, a few for me. First, on the end market, it seems like PCs were pretty weak in the first quarter, just from all the data points. It seems like that came through your numbers. Just want to see what you guys are thinking going forward, and what you guys are seeing from customers on the PC side. And also on the mobile side, it sounds like you guys have some inventory build. Just want to get a little bit of color on what caused that inventory build, and how you guys see that playing out? And then my last question is on the Inotera financing. You say there's no updates. But given where your stock is right now, would you contemplate doing the equity portion in debt given, again, where your stock price is now, and the amount of shares you guys would have to issue to finance that $1 [million] piece? Thanks. PRELIMINARY TRANSCRIPT: ""Preliminary Transcript"" indicates that the Transcript has been published in near real-time by an experienced professional transcriber.

For FY16 Q4, Micron posted total revenue of $3.2 billion, with gross margin of 18%, and a non-GAAP net loss of $56 million or $0.05 per share. Both revenue and gross margin were at the high end of the guidance range, and together generated earnings per share that exceeded guidance. Operating cash flow was $896 million. On the last call, we reported that -- while we were seeing signs of improvement in selected markets, we were uncertain of the extent and duration of the improvements. During the quarter, we continued to see market conditions improve, driven by both supply and demand fundamentals. Industry inventory appears lean, and the current market outlook for both NAND and DRAM continues to be positive. Currently prices are increasing in a number of segments, stabilizing in others, and we are seeing fewer segments showing residual declines. This environment framed our thinking in the guidance that Ernie will provide a little later on. We made significant progress on a number of key initiatives in the quarter, including the completion of the mobile product qualifications that we have been discussing, and our early 1X nanometer DRAM deployment. We are also seeing benefits of the 3D NAND yield ramp, which generated stronger than expected NAND bit growth in the quarter. I'm going to provide a high level overview of each of the business units, and Ernie will follow with more details on each business' financial performance. In our compute and networking business unit, we experienced accelerating revenue growth in the face of moderating pricing environment. Revenue growth was driven by continued increases of 20-nanometer shipments, as well as a significant transition to DDR4 in the cloud and client segments, where shipments exceeded DDR3 for the first time. We saw ongoing strength in graphics, driven by our GDDR5 and 5X products which supported NVIDIA's introduction of the 5X based Titan X, the highest performance consumer graphics card in the market. In the enterprise segment, Micron was recognized at the Flash Memory Summit as the innovation leader in non-volatile DIMMs, an important solution for high performance servers. Turning to our mobile business unit. China is becoming a more significant growth driver in mobile devices. Most of these devices are differentiated by large amounts of memory, including up to 6 gigabytes of low power DRAM. Additionally, the top of the line Apple and Samsung models now ship with 256 gigabytes of NAND, and we see mid range Chinese handsets heading in the same direction in order to compete. Although there is a moderating pace of smartphone unit growth, significant content increases of both NAND and DRAM will generate strong overall bit growth. During the quarter, we introduced four new mid to high density mobile 3D NAND products with positive reviews from the press and from our customer base. Mobile DRAM and eMCP price declines moderated in the quarter with more recent signs of stabilization and increases. Revenue growth in our embedded business unit has been driven by a record automotive business, and increased performance in the consumer and connected home segments, as well as a strengthening industrial multi-market business during the quarter. We have maintained our leadership position in automotive to strong customer support and the introduction of new products that meet the fast-growing memory content requirements for infotainment, ADAS and instrument cluster applications. High temperature DRAM and automotive grade NAND products are enabling a strong design win pipeline. The introduction of several new industrial solutions has positioned us to grow our share within IMM, and retain our high market share in machine-to-machine communication modules as the industry migrates from 2G to 4G and LTE. We have also been successful in achieving strong market share positions in consumer applications from action cameras and home automation to high volume markets including digital TV and set-top boxes. Finally our storage business unit is continuing to transition it's product line to our leading edge 3D NAND technology. We've seen positive response from customers this quarter related to our refreshed SSD portfolio, which offers a breadth of solutions to meet diverse application requirements. We're finalizing qualification with eight major OEMs on our 1100 client drive, and are engaging with cloud customers on future designs. In the enterprise, we're seeing companies begin to retrofit HDD infrastructure with SAS SSDs as they modernize existing investments. Our customers in demanding sectors like financial services and energy are moving storage closer to the server. We've seen significant interest in our PCIe, NVMe drives in these applications due to their ability to deliver very consistent high performance. We are actively expanding TLC 3D NAND across our cloud and enterprise portfolio, and expect to introduce our first TLC 3D SATA drive for these markets later this year, followed by a server-focused version early next year. We expect to see positive supply and demand dynamics in the SSD market for 2017. Turning to the memory industry more generally, we've seen further evidence that DRAM wafer output is declining as a result of lost throughput related to the 20-nanometer and 1X nanometer conversions. Absent some replacement of these wafers, we could see industry supply growth as low as mid-teens in 2017. If some of the lost wafer output is replaced, industry supply growth could be in the high teens percent range. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid 20% range. For NAND, we estimate 2017 industry bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, which is in line with 2016. This compares to our long-term bit demand growth forecast in the low to mid 40% range. Despite significant investments in 3D conversions across the industry, we believe that 2017 supply growth will be relatively balanced with demand, given the disruption in the fab output related to these conversions. For our operational priorities for FY17, or our operational priorities for FY17, continue to be targeted at ramping advanced technologies with an added focus on building out a more robust product portfolio, in particular for non-volatile memory products. For DRAM, we begin the 1X nanometer ramp, and expect to have meaningful output by the middle of 2017. At our Winter Analyst day, we shared two year bit growth targets for DRAM, and we are on track to meet these targets. We were slightly below the range in FY17, and expect to be above the range in FY17. All of the DRAM bit growth will come from technology transitions, and we currently have no plans to add wafer capacity. We expect our FY17 DRAM costs per bit to decline 20% to 25%, as a result of completing the 20-nanometer migration, and initiating the 1X nanometer conversion. Our cash costs per bit declines will be meaningfully higher than this range. For NAND, we will continue to focus on ramping our Gen 1 3D as well as TLC. As we updated at our last Analyst meeting, 3D bit output will exceed 2D output in the current quarter, ahead of our initial target. We will also be working on deploying second-generation 64-layer 3D technology. Similar to DRAM, our 2016 NAND bit growth came in below the two year CAGR shared at our Analyst event, and we therefore expect 2017 to be above that range. We are forecasting our FY17 NAND cost per bit to decline 20% to 25%, as a result of the 3D and TLC conversions. This cost per bit includes the impact of our planned build-out of SSDs, eMCPs, and Managed NAND solutions, all of which carry additional bill of materials costs but will also enable a richer ASP mix. On a like-for-like basis, cost per bit will decline more substantially. Relative to 3D Xpoint technology, we are working with market enablers on adoption of our QuantX solutions, and continue to believe this innovative technology will be an important contributor to Micron's future success, with initial revenue later in 2017. Now I'd like to turn the mic over to Ernie. Thank you, Mark. We had a solid end to our fiscal year, as our continued focus on execution, coupled with a more favorable business environment resulted in improved financial performance. I'll begin my comments today with some technology and business unit details, followed by an overview of the Company's results for the quarter, and guidance for our first quarter of FY17. DRAM represented 60% of our total revenue with the following segmentation. Mobile represented about 25%, similar to the prior quarter. The PC segment was in the upper 20% range, up slightly from the prior quarter. The server business was in the high teens percent range, down from the prior quarter. And specialty DRAM which includes networking, graphics, auto, and other embedded technologies was in the low 30% range, up from the prior quarter and primarily driven by an increase in graphics which represented more than 10% for the quarter. In our non-volatile memory business, trade revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation. Consumer, which includes memory cards, USB, and components represented about 50%, down slightly from the prior quarter. Mobile was in the high teens percent range, up from 13% in the prior quarter, as we began to see the impact of our completed customer quals. As a reminder, eMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs represented 13% similar to last quarter, and the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range, similar to prior quarter. Turning to performance by business unit. The compute and networking business unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.25 billion, up 14% sequentially primarily driven by 20-nanometer shipment growth, accompanied by strengthening demand, and a moderating pricing environment across all segments. The non-GAAP operating loss was $7 million or less than 1% of revenue. In the enterprise segment, conversions to DDR4 are now largely complete, and we are focused on enabling our solutions for the next-generation server platform. We are seeing continued interest in both higher density RDIMMs and LRDIMMs, as well as NVDIMM solutions. The cloud component of the enterprise segment is growing quickly, driven by continued growth in density across both DDR3 and DDR4 solutions. In graphics, we saw growth well above typical seasonality, driven by our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products. There are additional G5X based product announcements from NVIDIA in both the graphics and workstation segments during the quarter. In networking, we enjoyed double-digit revenue growth, with strength across all regions, and growing interest in applying the high bandwidth capabilities of GDDR5 and GDDR5X to the networking segment. Finally, within the client segment, we saw market demand which exceeded our expectations, as well as a continued transition to DDR4 which for the first time represented a majority of client shipments. The mobile business unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $671 million, up 20% sequentially driven by a strong quarter in our eMCP products. The non-GAAP operating loss was $45 million or 7% of revenue, and was partially impacted by the consumption of higher cost early production inventory accumulated over the last two quarters. We saw significant growth in the recently qualified higher density MCPs, and as smartphone OEMs are positioning their products based on higher memory density specifications, which is helping to accelerate adoption of smartphones with richer memory content. The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $513 million, up 5% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $133 million or 26% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by record automotive and increasing consumer business, combined with some recovery in our industrial multi-market business. The automotive business delivered solid results with revenue up 6% sequentially, driven by strong and increasing demand for both DRAM and eMMC solutions for infotainment, instrument cluster, and advanced driver systems applications. European, Korean and Japanese customers continue to fuel this growth, and our portfolio of leading edge automotive grade solutions is continuing to enable platform design wins. The industrial and multi-market business increased [16]% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of our NAND solutions into the Japanese amusement market. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for our NOR and NAND-based MCPs used in machine-to-machine wireless communication modules. Consumer and connected home revenue was up 7% sequentially, with solid demand for MCPs used in action cameras and home automation applications. We continue to see this demand pattern continue in the current fiscal quarter which typically sees strong seasonal demand. Our 20-nanometer DDR4 products continue to ramp into set-top boxes and IMM applications. The storage business delivered fiscal Q4 revenue of $758 million, up 5% sequentially. The non-GAAP operating loss was $69 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we entered production and OEM qualification of TLC 3D NAND based SSDs in the client and consumer segments, providing customers with a refreshed 3D-based portfolio of storage products that span the demand spectrum in these markets. In the enterprise SSD segments, consecutive quarter bits sold were up 45% based on higher sales of our planar MLC-based cloud drive. We are deploying 3D TLC across the enterprise and cloud portfolio, with several product launches over the next two quarters. Moving on to overall Company results. Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $3.2 billion at the top end of our guided range, and up 11% sequentially. Fairly significant increases in volume shipments for DRAM were offset by moderating ASP declines, while trade NAND shipments increased as a result of early success of our 3D ramp, and we experienced generally stable ASPs. Gross margin for the quarter was 18%, also at the top end of our guided range. The non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $56 million or $0.05 per share, significantly better than our guidance. For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP profitability, despite our technology transition and memory market pricing pressure, achieving non-GAAP net income of $66 million or $0.06 per share. As a reminder, Micron included both amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock compensation expense in our fiscal Q4 non-GAAP results. Taken together, these two items represent $0.04 a share in the fourth fiscal quarter, and $0.20 per share for the full FY16. Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 13% compared to the prior quarter, as a result of a 20% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a 6% decrease in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the fourth quarter increased 2 percentage points to 20%, primarily driven by strong cost reductions as a result of the continued 20-nanometer ramp. Our non-volatile trade revenue increased 12% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 13% increase in bit shipments, partially offset by a 1% decrease in ASPs. Gross margin decreased a couple of percentage points to 16%, as costs per bit was up related to the 3D ramp, and build-out of higher cost storage and mobile solutions to support future growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $559 million. This was below our guidance primarily due to continued expense control and the timing of pre-qualification expenses for the fourth quarter, some of which will now occur in fiscal Q1. The Company generated operating cash flow of $896 million, which included a strong quarter for collection activity, and we ended the quarter with cash and marketable investments of approximately $4.8 billion. In the fourth fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.7 billion. Before we move on to our guidance for the upcoming quarter, I wanted to share some changes to our reporting. The first of these changes relates to the depreciation schedule for our DRAM capital equipment. Previously, this equipment had been depreciated over five years, however, given the longer intervals between technology transitions, we've changed the depreciable life of our DRAM capital equipment from five years to seven years. This change will reduce depreciation by approximately $100 million per quarter on a going forward basis. The depreciation schedule for NAND-related equipment remains unchanged. Additionally, and to be consistent with the majority of semiconductor companies who report non-GAAP results, Micron will exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from our non-GAAP reporting. These expenses on average are approximately $50 million per quarter. Moving on now to our guidance for the first fiscal quarter, which we developed in the context of the market environment that Mark described earlier, on a non-GAAP basis we expect the following. Consolidated revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion, gross margin in the range of 23% to 25.5%, operating expenses between $600 million and $650 million, due to the resumption of variable compensation expense, and the higher pre-qual expenses that we spoke of earlier. Taken together, these items represent a sequential increase of approximately $80 million, of which $25 million resulted from the timing of pre-qual between fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1. Operating income in the range of $245 million to $330 million, and EPS ranging between $0.13 and $0.21 per share based on [1.046 billion] diluted shares. Relative to our capital spending plans for FY17 as we shared last month, we expect to spend between $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion net of partner contributions. Between 40% and 50% of the total will be allocated to DRAM, between 30% and 40% to non-volatile memory, and between 15% and 25% to technology and product enablement. Consistent with our public comments, this level of CapEx allows us to appropriately fund our technology investments, while achieving neutral to positive free cash flow generation in FY17. Operationally, we are on track to deliver the bit growth and cost per bit reduction targets that we previously shared, as we complete the 20-nanometer DRAM conversion, reach crossover of first-generation 3D NAND this quarter, and commence the ramp of 1X nanometer DRAM and second-generation 3D NAND in 2017. For FY17 specifically, we expect DRAM and NAND cost per bit reductions between 20% and 25%. Finally, relative to the Inotera transaction, Micron and Inotera have concluded that sufficient progress has been made in Inotera addressing the issues that caused the delay in closing. An Inotera Board meeting has been scheduled for October 11, and the Directors of Inotera are expected to set a Share Swap record date at that meeting. We anticipate that the Share Swap record date will be set for the first half of December of 2016. With that, I'll turn it back to Mark. Thank you, Ernie. To summarize, we faced challenging market conditions in FY16, in addition to going through a transition period for our technology migrations. Despite these headwinds, we ended the year with positive non-GAAP EPS. Compared to prior cycles, this represents a material improvement in our performance, and further reinforces our belief in structural industry improvements. We are now experiencing a more positive and improving environment, and Micron is committed to making even further improvements in our relative performance, with enhanced growth and cost reductions, and expanded capability to deliver value-added products to enable our customers. Okay, operator, we are now ready to begin Q&A.","This is Mark. Maybe I'll take that one, C.J. Certainly relative to the sell-through of inventory, there is an impact there, given some of the inventory we've built up over the last couple of quarters relative to the qualifications we mentioned. Relative to market assumptions, we're not going to get into the detail as always of the embedded margin, because we don't want to forecast the ASPs for you. But I think that it's fair to say that we are seeing early signs of significant price movements. And as we've done in the past, we want to wait before we get ahead of ourselves in predicting what may come as we move further out into the quarter. But I do think that that the trend is positive, and the bias is positive. Yes. Well, certainly, if we think about inventory in the marketplace, certainly channel inventory I think is very, very tight, maybe one to two weeks, or less than a week. At the major customers, we have less precision relative to that. But I'd say it's certainly down, and there's a sense of urgency at the large OEM customers as well. In some cases, we may be looking at allocation of certain products in certain markets. And certainly, the customers are beginning to ask for longer term price commitments, which is in my mind always a good thing. And we'll look at those on a case by case basis, and potentially take customers up on that where appropriate, but obviously always keeping the long-term interest of the shareholders in mind. Sure. This is Ernie. So I think it's important to acknowledge, that although we beat our EPS guidance, we actually were well in the ranges of both our revenue and our gross margin guidance. And so we did think about the opportunity that was ahead of ourselves as we were giving the guidance for last quarter, and we've done the same thing in essence this quarter as well. So I think you can look at the range of our guidance, and it generally contemplates the outcomes that we see. And obviously, if things continue on a strong and favorable momentum, it's reasonable to think that you'd end up at the upper end of both pieces of the range, which would generate a result similar to this quarter. And I think consistent with Mark's prior comments, we are continuing to see positive momentum. I do think it's important to understand that that momentum has existed and has started to strengthen. And so, as a result of its actual impact in our fiscal quarter, with part of it already completed and we're in negotiations for others, I think that the trap we want to avoid is presuming that whatever the latest pricing news is gets retroactively applied across the entire quarter, because that's certainly not the environment that we're living in. But I do think that we were pretty thoughtful about the revenue range. And obviously we're going to work hard and try to do as well as we can. But we put a lot of thought behind the numbers we've just shared with you. Yes, we're always looking for ways to improve our relative competitive position, and we've used partnerships and strategic relationships extensively in the past. We'll continue to evaluate that, and again, always with the long term in mind. We're -- there's an embedded assumption in there that there are lots of opportunities out there today, and I think I would not try to dissuade you of that view of life. I would just caution you that we're going to be pretty careful and deliberate about making sure we take a long-term view relative to the relationships and the partnerships we engage in. And that we're doing something that really drives a long-term strategic benefit for the Company, as opposed to a short-term fix of more supply in the marketplace. So as we had in our prepared remarks, we do expect the transaction to close at this point in -- some time in the middle of December. We did contemplate that timing in our guidance, so it doesn't really have a dramatic impact on our FQ1 guide at all. And certainly the transaction will continue to be accretive to gross margins. It will continue, and continues to be accretive to free cash flow. And essentially, the EPS accretion is really dependent on how we choose to finance that last $1 billion component, which we don't have to make a decision on until about 30 days or so prior to closing. So as we said before, we have the option of using equity, or a convert, or cash, or a combination of those. And so, the specific EPS accretion will really be dependent upon what we finally decide for those things. Well, what we said Mark was that we had given these two year CAGRs and we were slightly below for both NAND and DRAM in FY16, so it's reasonable to think it would be slightly above the range that we provided in FY17. So that we, over the two year CAGR fulfill the commitment that we made around those bit growth CAGRs. So yes, that's a reasonable thing to assume. Yes, that's a reasonable way to think about it, sure, Tim. So let me try to frame that for you a little bit. We had a couple things that are impacting this quarter's OpEx. The first was, that about $25 million give or take of pre-qual expenses that had planned to spend in FQ4 are appearing in FQ1. And then secondly, we have -- we had, even prior to this rollover, the highest point of pre-qual expenses for the entire fiscal year was actually occurring in Q1, plus we have the resumption of variable compensation, given the new pricing environment. And so, what we've try to frame for folks is sequentially, between the variable comp being reinstated, as well as the pre-qual expenses, that's a sequential increase of about $80 million from FQ4 to FQ1. So that predominantly explains the change to the OpEx. And it certainly, we're hopeful that the variable compensation piece continues, because we're hopeful that the business environment is favorable. And we would expect pre-qual expenses to moderate, such that we should be in that range of $600 million plus or minus, so we'd probably mid point around $600 million a few quarters -- maybe a couple quarters higher, a couple quarters a little bit lower, under the new framework for recording OpEx. So those numbers would still exclude stock-based comp. But you would expect to see a pretty meaningful moderation of OpEx, as we go forward throughout the year as a result of this pre-qual situation being resolved from the rollover. I think part of the explanation of Q4 bit growth being slightly below, I think what we previously talked about was in fact that as we watched the market evolve, we made some choices around where we would like that output to be. And the result is that our Q1, fiscal Q1 bit output would -- is now going to be higher than what we had expected it to be. So obviously, that did play into our thinking as we saw the market evolve. Relative to specific shortages, I'm not aware of any. I don't know, Mark, if you are, but certainly, all of our customers are being very attentive to making sure that their supply needs are taken care of, and we are seeing certain segments and certain customers where the possibility of allocation is present. Yes, I don't think we want to call those out today on this call, but there's certainly that risk. Yes. Yes, I think it will reaccelerate relatively quickly. It has been a little bit more of a lumpy business here over the last year or so, but we like the trends there. Sure -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Yes, I think you have a couple things. First, as we talked about in the last quarter or so, as we are ramping on the new technologies, and predominantly because of these delayed mobile quals, we had some inventory built up that is now flowing through. However, we absolutely still continue to get more and more output from the factory, and it's going to be a couple quarters before that inventory actually starts to decline. But we have a very clear view of an ability to decrease inventory meaningfully over the course of FY17. I'd also remind you that we are also building supply chains for SSDs and MCPs, which take longer in terms of their aggregate end-to-end cycle time than selling components. So we have that effect as well. That will cap out here in the next quarter or so, and then you'll see a normalization and a flow through of that as well. So we're not -- we're cognizant of the inventory position. We like to think that we anticipated that, and shared that with you. And we're equally confident that the inventory will decline nearly every quarter in FY17. Yes, to be honest, we feel pretty good about where we sit, given the trends in the marketplace as well, and we don't feel quite as much urgency as we might under different market conditions. On average, the Inotera transaction is going to add somewhere between [$300 million] and $600 million of cash flow on a free cash flow basis. But I'd really stress that that's an average amount which would be the free cash flow net of the incremental depreciation -- I'm sorry, the incremental CapEx. But I think that the best way I could guide your thinking there is that we have prepared pretty conservative plan, and we have a free cash flow neutral position in the context of that conservative plan. Obviously, Q4 is a little bit stronger. It's fair to say that Q1 was a little bit stronger, as we look at it now versus our conservative plan. And so we would expect to be able to accumulate cash over the course of 2017, if in fact this current market environment continues. Any time we use words like significant, it gets hard to determine what's significant to you or significant to me, but trust me every dollar is significant to us. And so we're being very careful and monitoring that very carefully. Yes, a lot of moving pieces, Harlan. I think just to get to the crux of your question, yes, you should anticipate cost per bit, start coming down nicely with the 3D ramp, as we start flushing those wafers through the back end, and out in the marketplace. Costs are coming down nicely this quarter, and [see] a continued road map ahead for that, as we move through the year. Yes, and we provided a cost per bit reduction forecast for the year to you, and I think everything Mark said is absolutely true. And counter balancing that just a bit is the supply chain build up that I talked about, because as MCPs and those SSDs have a higher COGS component theoretically, they are also generating more margin. But if we're only looking at the cost perspective, that will have a tendency to dampen the cost per bit reduction because the mix is changing. Yes, so we have actually wafers in manufacturing fabs in both Hiroshima and Taiwan that are yielding. The output today is insignificant. We'll continue to run at engineering pilot line lots. And by the time we get to the middle of next year, you should see it be significant in terms of our overall output. I think probably going to wait another quarter before we give you a little bit more precision on what the --  when the bit crossover might be. Sure. So let me address the question about the storage business. We are certainly hopeful that we can exit the year at least with a profitable note for the storage business. I think it's dependent on a few things. Obviously, we're in the middle of a very significant portfolio change-out, and we have to execute on those. So far, our record has been good with respect to the client and consumer segments. But we have some big product launches, with respect to both data center and enterprise coming up here toward the end of this calendar year and in early calendar 2017. And those would be really pivotal to us in completing that transition. I think that again, track record has been good. The SSDs have been well reviewed, and we're very optimistic that our subsequent product launches will be equally successful. I also think it's important to keep in mind that we also are seeing benefit of 3D in the memory -- or I'm sorry, in the mobile business unit as well. We saw that -- we had the mobile percentage of our NAND business this quarter move from the low teens essentially to the high teens, as a result of more and more quals there, and the increasing importance of the MCP portfolio. So we are seeing benefit of that, really across multiple business units. Let me just add to that on the seasonality question. Q4 obviously, typically is a very strong quarter for NAND. Hard to know for sure, but our sense is that the demand picture probably has more staying power than just the typical seasonality that you would see, given the strong growth in the end applications. Yes, I'll take that. So obviously, as has been the case, the specialty markets, the embedded markets, whether it's automotive, industrial, medical probably top of the list. Within the computing and networking segment, graphics has been quite strong. Server probably next, and then followed up with mobile and client. In terms of demand? But that -- it's a very quickly moving dynamic right now. So yes, we're seeing that happen real-time as we sell through the early production and move more and more of the products into the TLC format. And certainly more of that opportunity is ahead of us than it is behind us, given that we're just going to hit bit crossover for 3D in this quarter. And as Mark said, we're continuing to transition which adds costs because it suppresses output. But with more significant bit growth ahead, we would expect the cost reduction opportunity to accelerate a little bit here throughout FY17. Thank you. I think, John, actually it's really a little bit more about the lag that you typically see as pricing starts to turn around in some of these things. Yes, there is an inventory effect relative to some of these products that we built up in inventory that were early production on either 20-nanometer or 3D NAND, et cetera. As we sell-through, that's a little bit of a headwind until that's flushed out. But it's really more around, as ASPs turn around, they don't turn around instantaneously. And they didn't turn around until we were into the quarter last quarter. So remember, we had a pretty significant beat relative to the mid point of our guidance last quarter, which gives you an indication that the pricing was starting to accelerate then. It takes a little while to play out, and to flush through as we see these things happen. So the trends are all in place. And I think we're heading where you think you are, where we ought to be, but it can take a little while to play out through the financials. Yes. And I didn't provide a cost specific cost per bit target for FQ1. Yes. Well, there's a lot of components to it. I think you put your finger on a piece of it, which is that the volatility in this business, I think we can conclude is going to be less going forward. This certainly seems to have been borne out as we move through this last cycle. It doesn't mean the cycles are gone, it just means that the volatility is less, and so that is less of a defensive driver so to speak. An important thing for us in this whole picture is operational flexibility and control. As we think about our ability to drive new technologies, either into manufacturing or to transition technologies with the Inotera assets, having ownership of that asset and the ability to mix and match different technologies, as well as potentially more value-add products and capture that value as significant. Notwithstanding the fact that we have a good operating relationship with Inotera, we believe that there is more value we can bring as sole owners than as Board members and operational partners. And at the end of the day, it gives us the ability as well to take the cash flow that's going to be generated with Inotera, and deploy it across our network where we find that most useful. So a number of different factors playing into it, all of which, I think, point in the direction that we're moving. Sure. So when we provided that CapEx guidance of essentially midpoint of $5 billion net of partner contributions, we did say it included contemplated investments from Inotera. So that's an all-in number, as you know, we don't break out specific CapEx by fab, so we don't plan to start doing that now. But that $5 billion midpoint, with [a little] range around it is inclusive of anticipated investments at Inotera. No, the first out 3D was MLC, but we very quickly introduced TLC. And as we said in our prepared remarks, most of our client consumer SSDs are now out on TLC, and we're qualifying TLC into mobile applications as well. And we will be a majority TLC by the middle of FY17 here as we go forward. So that's part of the engine of the significant bit growth that we've contemplated and forecast. So depreciation life of the NAND equipment is about five years. And really, we conducted quite an extensive study around how long the technology transitions existed, or took in the DRAM world, how long they were contemplated to take on a going forward basis. We looked at the practices of others, both competitors and partners. But really, the substance of the decision was related to what we anticipate and what we've been saying for some time is a slowing of the technology transitions, and therefore, the longer use ability of that equipment as the technology transition times change. And the reality is, there's a range of answers you come up with when you do a study like that. And much like the midpoint of a guided range, and seven years felt to us like it was not overly aggressive, but not overly conservative either. So you could assume that we could have gone a year or two on either side of that, and we chose a position that we thought was reasonable, given what we know and understand about the pace of technology transition. We -- yes, we expect depreciation to be somewhere in the range of $4 billion for the year, give or take. And operator, I think we have time for one more question. Certainly, first thing we're going to be focused on is actually accumulating the cash. So that's my first priority, because I have to have some of it to be able to decide what to do with it. And certainly at that point in time, we would certainly look at the opportunities that were available to delever. And we would look at those in the context of, everything else that's going around. And it's really impossible to say specifically what we would decide to do in the context of a future that's not yet here. But I can tell you that delevering is an important priority. And depending on how much cash we generate, we may choose to deploy a $100 million of that or so back into CapEx, if that's the right decision. But delevering is certainly nearest and dearest to our hearts at the moment.","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. First question, Ernie, for you on the pricing front. I know you don't want to go into specific details, but curious as you think about November, what you're embedding in terms of changes to mix, and perhaps any flow through of lower margin inventory, and any other kind of factors that we should be thinking about as it relates to DRAM ASPs? Mark, that's very helpful. As my follow-up, how do you think about channel inventory today? And this is another DRAM question. And then, as part of that, how do you expect customers to act as you look into 2017, in an environment where bit supply is sub 20%, and demand presumably higher than that? How do you expect changes in behavior there? Thank you. Very helpful. Thank you. Yes, I just want to come back to the guidance, because it's something that people are trying to gauge, given that last quarter, at least relative to how you originally guided, you guys came in a lot better. And I know at the time that there was a lot of moving pieces, and you guys wanted to give yourself cushion. So could you talk a little bit about visibility? And at least on the pricing front, if we could get a sense just directionally, how you're thinking about ASPs in the November period? And then I have a follow-up. Yes, that's helpful. And then Mark, I have a strategic question for you which is, you talk about one of the priorities being to just ramp advanced products in non-volatile memory. But at the same time, implicit in the FY17 free cash flow guidance is that you, at least the way I'm interpreting it, is that you'll continue to burn cash in NAND. And so my question is, at what point do you consider a partnership to lessen the period expense and the CapEx burden associated with running this business? Helpful, thank you. Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is, I was hoping you could update us on the Inotera transaction, and if that were to close, if you could help us understand the potential accretion or dilution from that transaction? And then related to it, to what extent is Inotera closing already embedded in any of the financial guidance that you gave for FY17? That's helpful. And then a clarification on your comment that Micron will be above the CAGR that it provided for DRAM and [N] bit growth in FY17. I just want to clarify, you would expect to be above the high end of your guidance for both DRAM and NAND? So I think it was over 30% in DRAM for FY17, and over 40% in NAND for FY17? That's very helpful. Thank you. Thank you, I had two. Ernie, I'm still a little confused on the guidance. If I try to adjust for the changes in the reporting, it sounds like you're excluding about $150 million per quarter now. So on an apples-to-apples basis, the guidance is actually like $0.13 or something like that lower than what the headline number is, or more like $0.04 at the mid point. Am I not thinking about that right? Okay. And then that leads me to the question about OpEx, because it seems like some of that is related to OpEx. If you add the stock comp back and you assume that it's mostly OpEx, you're guiding to like $650 million to $700 million. But it sounds like maybe $80 million of that is really one-time in nature. So maybe the baseline is more like $600 million going into next quarter? Is that -- or sorry, going into the fiscal Q2? Is that the right run rate headed into the January quarter? Yes, thank you. Congrats on the guidance. DRAM question here. You've got favorable contract pricing. You didn't quite get the bit output acceleration in Q4. Just wanted to understand that a bit. And are there any shortages in terms of meeting customer demand at this point? Okay. Thanks. And for my follow-up here, server as a percent of DRAM, that is down sequentially, and August is -- what's happening here, perhaps enterprise is offsetting the cloud. And shouldn't this be a pretty attractive market to serve? I think, pricing in server typically attracts PCs, with a little bit of lag? Okay, thank you. Yes. Thanks, and congrats on good execution. Just a question on the inventory increase on a year-over-year basis, relative to the revenue increase year-over-year based on your guidance. So it seems like the -- it seems like that the inventory is increasing at a faster clip than revenue, so just wanted to get a sense in terms of any concerns you see there? (multiple speakers) So with inventory outgrowing revenue on a year-over-year basis? Okay. That was helpful. And just a last question for me on the cash flow. Obviously, you can't talk a little bit about FY17. But if you take your CapEx guidance and your depreciation add back, it does seem like it would still be difficult to generate a meaningful free cash flow next year, assuming a fairly big ramp, and gross margins and revenue -- gross margins maybe, continue to increase above and beyond what you're guiding for November. So I just wanted to get a sense of how you're looking at free cash flow, and the Inotera agreement, how much free cash flow does that add to the Company, if we were to add that back on? Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. NAND cost per bit was actually up slightly in Q4. Was most of this mix related? Maybe you could just tell us what cost per bit declines were on a like-for-like basis? And should we anticipate an acceleration of cost per bit starting here in the first quarter, especially I think as you mentioned you'd get 3D bit crossover over 2D? But it seems like to me, as gross margins for NAND should be inflecting up here in Q1, but I'm just trying to get a sense for that? Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then, on the 1X DRAM ramp that you highlighted in your slides, when does that ramp actually commence? Is it end of this year, beginning of next calendar year? And you've mentioned also that you'd expect significant output by middle of next year, maybe you can just be more specific on when you expect bit crossover 1X versus 20-nanometer? Thank you. Great. Thank you. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions for me. Just following on that prior question regarding NAND cost per bit and all of the mix issues, can you just take that one step forward and talk about maybe how the storage business unit starts to recover in terms of profitability? Is there a path to turning profitable this fiscal year? And then secondly, could you just talk about seasonality this year maybe versus last year in terms of what kind of unit shipments you're seeing versus content shipments from some of your core markets, and whether it's stronger or weaker than a year ago? Thanks. Thanks very much. Thank you for taking my question. Your guidance for first quarter is a significant increase over fourth quarter. Can you give us a ranking of the end markets or the end products that are driving the increase? Okay. And are you seeing a significant increase with 3D NAND versus the planar NAND? Gross (multiple speakers). Sorry, no, gross margin (multiple speakers). Okay, great. Congratulations on the good results. Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to go back to the cost side of the equation, guys. Just given the change in the depreciation schedule for the November quarter, I would have thought your ability to get gross margin to the high 20% range, especially in this pricing environment, would have been fairly easy. So I'm just curious as to what the offsets are in the November quarter. Is this all about the quals on mobile? And if it is, what do you estimate that to be a hit to gross margins, and when might that be done? And then, Ernie, I know you gave full year cost targets on a per bit basis. Did you give them for the fiscal first quarter? If you did, I missed them. Okay. And then as my follow-up, Mark, just on the Inotera acquisition. If you go back and look at what you guys have tried to accomplish over the last seven or eight years, it's actually been to try to mitigate the cyclicality of the industry within your financials by setting up some of these JVs, buying Inotera reverses that. I'm curious, is this purely a financial decision on your part? You mentioned in your prepared comments that this downturn troughed at much higher levels than past downturns. So is that giving you the confidence, or is there actually a fundamental reason to own the asset? Will this allow you to ramp 1X or 1Y or 1Z more quickly owning Inotera? If you could just give a justification that would be great. Thank you. Yes, thanks for taking my question. Ernie, just going back to your CapEx for the next fiscal year, it sounds like you're incrementally more confident with the Inotera deal. And in that context, how should we think about the incremental CapEx requirements for Inotera, in the context of your comment that Inotera would help with free cash flow accretion? I'm just trying to reconcile everything, and I have a follow-up. Got it. Thanks for the clarification. And then with the 3D NAND and a crossover with [300] NAND is, should I assume that all of the 3D NAND, the capacity coming online is TLC, or is there still any MLC left in the mix? Okay, thank you. Great. Thank you. Wonder if you could talk about the decision to move to seven year depreciable life on DRAM? That strikes me as a long time, and I look at your CapEx ratio to PP&E as a third. What was the thinking behind seven years, and can you remind us the depreciation life of the NAND equipment? Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then, as a follow-up, have you given or can you give an absolute number for depreciation for either the quarter or the fiscal year? Great. Thank you very much. Thanks very much. Ernie, earlier you noted that you might be able to generate cash over, some point over the next few quarters. Can you give us any idea of what you would do with any net cash generated? Would you be able to pay down debt, or are there other uses for cash? Great. Thanks very much.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to you, Sanjay. Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon. Micron's record first quarter results demonstrate the company's continued strong execution, a market environment that reflects the strategic importance of memory and flash storage and healthy supply and demand fundamentals. During the quarter, we continued to enhance our cost competitiveness, achieving these maturity on both 1X DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND. We improved our mix of high-value solutions, delivering record SSD revenues and further increasing our SSD share. More recently, we began shipping our first 64-layer NAND consumer SSD. We also introduced the industry's fastest high-density 32-gigabyte NVDIMM-N, which combines Micron's DRAM and NAND to deliver a persistent memory solution that addresses intense data analytics workloads. We have garnered solid interest from enterprise and cloud customers, and customer qualifications are underway. And we strengthened our talent bench with the recent addition of Manish Bhatia, who leads our global operations. Manish brings extensive experience in managing end-to-end operations, and is focused on driving manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies to reduce costs and improve our agility. Finally, we improved our financial foundation with the retirement of $2.4 billion of debt. I'm pleased with our accomplishments and believe our focus on speed and execution better position Micron to deliver value to our customers and capture the increasing number of end market opportunities. I will now discuss trends and results in each of our major markets. Cloud and traditional enterprise data center trends are continuing to drive robust demand for memory and flash storage solutions. Our Q1 SSD revenue to cloud and enterprise customers increased 50% sequentially. We recovered from the flash component issue discussed in our September earnings call that impacted last quarter's SSD sales. On the compute side, we have solid sequential DRAM revenue growth into data center markets, driven primarily by enterprise sales. DRAM bench shipments to both cloud and enterprise customers were up by more than 50% year-over-year, underscoring the data center's growing need for memory and our strong execution in this market. Our 1X nanometer designs have been well received by cloud customers, with more than a quarter of our cloud revenue in Q1 coming from our 1X technology. Fast qualification and production ramp by our cloud customers of new technology node products is a significant benefit, as it diversifies and accelerates our customer traction and market reach during early stages of production deployment of these advanced nodes. The need to access, analyze and store data extends well beyond the cloud. This is perhaps most evident in the mobile market. Smartphone capabilities has surpassed simple communication and web browsing. They help us navigate, monitor and interact with the world around us. New cameras capture precious moments with amazing fidelity, and emerging applications like AR have tremendous promise. This increase in functionality is driving the use of higher capacity memory solutions and increased storage in mobile devices. These trends, along with our solid execution, drove record mobile revenue in F Q1. We are strengthening our offerings and continue to diversify our portfolio of LPDRAM, MCP and discrete managed storage solutions to meet the growing needs of our customers. We are accelerating our progress to expand our portfolio of low-power solutions, with the release of new products, such as our 1X LPDRAM designs. We also shipped initial samples of our 64-layer NAND discrete UFS solution to chipset partners and customers with very promising results. Home automation and edge computing devices continue to drive strong revenues in consumer and industrial market segments, which require a wide variety of memory and managed [storage] products. As more edge devices begin to integrate machine learning and intelligence, we see opportunities to provide higher performance memory and flash storage solutions in these markets. We have also seen rapidly growing demand for our graphics products. The graphics market continues to be fueled by the ever-growing popularity of gaming and eSports. Although smaller in size, recent interest in cryptocurrency mining has put further pressure on graphics memory supply. Our close customer relationships and leading product portfolio helped drive record graphics revenue, up more than 75% year-over-year. We sampled industry-leading 16 gigabit per second GDDR6 products to key customers, and are seeing significant interest in automotive and networking applications that meet the high bandwidth this memory provides. We plan to ramp GDDR6 to production in early calendar 2018 for the graphics market, followed by other high-performance applications, such as automotive and networking. The rapid innovation in automotive technology towards autonomous driving continues to create significant demand for higher memory capacities and greater performance. We secured a key design win in an important autonomous driving platform this quarter and are focused on replicating our success to retain our leading-edge share in that market. Automotive customers are moving more rapidly to new memory technologies than they have in the past, and our announcement of the fastest 1X LPDDR4 and GDDR6 products for autonomous driving applications will ensure we continue to support this shift to leading-edge technologies. We also set record revenues supplying the networking applications that serve data centers and edge devices as our reputation for consistency and innovation drives strong ties with networking customers. These diversified growth drivers and structural market trends are generating tremendous opportunity for Micron. We are uniquely positioned in these markets with a broad portfolio of both DRAM and NAND solutions, excellent quality and comprehensive customer ecosystem engagement. We are focused on developing the right products, deepening our customer relationships and enriching our revenue mix to capitalize on these opportunities. Turning now to manufacturing and technology. Our ability to execute our technology road map and drive cost competitiveness are foundational to our ongoing success. In terms of wafer manufacturing plans, we still expect to achieve bit output crossover on 64 layer NAND during the second half of fiscal 2018 and expect to achieve bit output crossover on 1X DRAM by the end of calendar 2018. We are outfitting our new back-end factory in Taichung, Taiwan to ramp assembly and test capacity and expect meaningful output from the facility before the end of the fiscal year. Our capital investments are tracking with our deployment plans, and we are seeing good traction in improving the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our operations through these investments. Both 1Y DRAM and third-generation 3D NAND development are progressing well, and we remain on track for initial output of both in the second half of calendar 2018. We continue to make good progress with our 3D XPoint technology. Historically, Micron's efforts on 3D XPoint have been largely focused on technology development and early manufacturing ramp. But given our increased focus on high-value product solutions, we have recently resourced a product development team to address the opportunity ahead of us. Simultaneously, we are working with various players in the ecosystem to assess market and enablement opportunities, and we will provide further details of our views regarding these opportunities during our upcoming analyst event. We will also continue to have the opportunity to sell our 3D XPoint output to our partner, as this market develops. Switching to our industry outlook, our supply and demand projections remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. DRAM industry supply bit growth is expected to be about 20% in calendar 2018, and we expect a healthy market environment driven by the ongoing enterprise data center, cloud and mobile strength, as we just discussed. We expect the industry bit growth for NAND to approach 50% in calendar 2018 as the industry continues to ramp 64 layer designs into volume production. SSD adoption in client computing and data center applications continues to increase and will expand further as more supply becomes available over time. Against that backdrop, projections for our own bit growth remain unchanged. We expect our DRAM bit growth to be slightly below the industry, and we expect our NAND bit growth to be somewhat above the industry for fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018, we are focusing on technology transitions for both DRAM and NAND without any additions to our total wafer capacity and on improving our mix of high-value solutions to enhance our revenue share. For fiscal 2019 and beyond, we continue to assess scenarios for the Fab clean room space required to implement technology transitions to future, more advanced DRAM and 3D NAND nodes. I'll now turn it over to Ernie to provide details on our first quarter results by business unit. Thank you, Sanjay, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. We had a very strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding guidance across all financial metrics, driven by strong execution, a continued robust market environment and further progress on our technology migrations. For fiscal Q1, total company revenue was $6.8 billion, up 11% from the prior quarter and up 71% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 55%, up 4 percentage points from Q4 and 29 percentage points from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin was 46%, up from 41% in the prior quarter and up 35 percentage points from the year ago period. We continue to prudently manage spending with non-GAAP operating expenses totaling $612 million for the quarter, up 2% from Q4, with both SG&A and R&D remaining relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. Non-GAAP net income increased to 44% of revenue and totaled approximately $3 billion or $2.45 per share. This performance compares with $2.4 billion or $2.02 per share in Q4 and $335 million or $0.32 per share from the year ago period. Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit reported FQ1 revenue of $3.2 billion, up 13% sequentially, and more than double year ago levels. Our record performance was driven by increasing server memory content, which drove higher sales to enterprise customers together with strong demand for graphics processing. Operating income was 60% compared to 56% in F Q4 and 14% in FQ1 2017. Q1 Storage Business Unit revenues increased 7% sequentially to $1.4 billion, driven by strong growth in SSD sales. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 61%, driven by increasing market share in SSDs. In fact, sales of SSDs reached record levels in the quarter with double-digit sequential growth across consumer, client and enterprise and cloud markets. SBU operating margins increased to 29% from 19% in the prior quarter and negative 5% in fiscal Q1 '17. These results reflect a higher-value product mix and continued market acceptance of our TLC 3D NAND-based products. The Mobile Business Unit reported $1.4 billion in revenue, up 16% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. We are seeing strong acceptance of our LPDRAM products and continue to enhance our portfolio of managed NAND offerings. The solid demand environment, combined with the traction we've made with our latest generation products, led to operating income of 37%, up from 31% in FQ4 and 9% in FQ1 2017. The Embedded Business Unit reported revenue of $830 million in FQ1, in line with the prior quarter and up 44% year-over-year. Operating margin was 41%, essentially flat from the prior quarter, and up 10 percentage points year-over-year. As Sanjay noted earlier, we continue to see exciting demand trends across each of the underlying embedded markets with evolving end market requirements ranging from high-performance memory for autonomous driving to ultra-high-density storage solutions for edge devices, such as video surveillance cameras. We are focused on building upon our existing leadership position to capture these growth opportunities. Turning to results by product line. DRAM represented 67% of overall company revenue in fiscal Q1. Demand for client PCs, solid exposure to new flagship smartphones and ongoing strength from servers, particularly in cloud and hyperscale data centers, drove DRAM revenue higher during the quarter, up 13% sequentially and up 88% year-over-year. Sequentially, shipment quantities increased in the upper single-digit range, while ASPs increased in the mid-single-digit range. DRAM non-GAAP gross margin was 61.5% in FQ1, up 2 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 33 percentage points from the year ago quarter. Revenue from trade NAND increased 2% sequentially and represented 27% of overall company revenue in fiscal Q1. Trade NAND revenue was up 47% year-over-year, driven by our strong growth and market share gains in the SSD market and robust demand from the mobile and embedded markets. On a sequential basis, shipment quantities increased in the mid-single-digit range, while ASPs declined in the low single-digit range. Trade NAND non-GAAP gross margin was 49% in FQ1, up 9 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 26 percentage points from the year ago quarter, reflecting a richer mix of sales into high-value end markets. As Sanjay noted in his prepared remarks, we are making strong progress on the rollout of our 1X nanometer DRAM and 64 layer 3D NAND deployment. The rollout of these technologies will enable meaningful levels of ongoing cost per bit reduction as we make progress throughout fiscal '18. For DRAM, our bit output growth will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year, while NAND bit output growth will be relatively greater in the second half of the fiscal year. The company generated operating cash flow of $3.6 billion in fiscal Q1 compared to $1.1 billion in the year ago period. During the quarter, we deployed $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions. We continue to expect FY '18 CapEx in the range of $7.5 billion, plus or minus 5%, fairly balanced between the first and second halves of the fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion compared to negative free cash flow in the year ago period. We continue to pursue our plans to strengthen our balance sheet and lower debt. During fiscal Q1, we raised $1.4 billion from an equity offering and repurchased or converted $2.4 billion in principal amount of our debt. Total face value of debt was $9.3 billion as of the end of FQ1, and we currently expect to exit FY '18 with approximately $8 billion in face value debt. We expect the interest savings from these deleveraging actions, combined with higher interest income from larger cash balances and the anti-dilutive effects of selling converts for cash, to materially offset the dilutive impacts associated with the equity offering. Exiting FY '18, we foresee non-GAAP net interest expense of $25 million to $30 million per quarter versus $100 million per quarter in FQ4 of '17. We ended the first quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $6.6 billion and continue to see the opportunity to exit FY '18 in a positive net cash position. Moving on to guidance for fiscal Q2 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: revenue in the range of $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion; gross margin in the range of 54% to 58%; operating expenses between $625 million and $675 million; operating income ranging between $3.25 billion and $3.45 billion; and EPS ranging between $2.51 and $2.65 per share, based on 1,241,000,000 diluted shares. Finally, a word about tax reform. As drafted, the legislation would have no significant impact to our FY '18 tax rate, which we continue to expect to be in the mid-single-digit range. In FY '19 and beyond, we would expect some impact to our non-GAAP tax rate with an offsetting benefit of more flexibility in deploying our global cash balances. As further clarity around this legislation develops, we will provide appropriate updates. With that, I will turn it back to Sanjay. Thank you, Ernie. As we close out calendar 2017 and look to 2018, we see increasing opportunities for Micron to play a larger role in the technology trends shaping modern life. We will be hosting an Analyst Conference in May, where we plan to elaborate on our view of these trends and how Micron envisions our technologies shaping the world in the years to come. We believe that our technologies, capabilities and team talent place us in a unique position in the market. Memory and flash storage are strategic assets that put Micron at the intersection of the biggest growth trends in technology, and we cannot be more excited about our future. Our customers increasingly view us as an essential partner in early design discussions due to the differentiation our solutions can provide. We are focused on increasing this value, and I look forward to sharing the results of that focus throughout 2018. We will now open for questions.","So in terms of the industry demand supply environment, let me just say that with respect to the industry supply growth in the calendar year 2018, we have said that the industry supply growth would be approaching 50%. While that is more than what the calendar year '17 supply growth is in the range of 35% to 40%, the -- overall, what you have to look at is the demand requirements. In calendar year '17, of course, supply has been tight. There has been pent-up demand, particularly in the areas of client SSDs and the client PC, notebook PC environments. The march toward high-density SSDs in notebook PCs was somewhat slowed down given the overall tightness of supply in calendar year '17. When I look ahead at calendar year '18, I see strong demand trends with respect to attach rate of SSDs and client PCs continue to increase. The applications related to cloud and data centers, enterprise data centers continuing to drive higher average capacities, usage in cloud and data center applications as well. And certainly, in mobile applications also, the average capacities of NAND content continue to increase. And these are all increasing because of the trends, right? I mean, attach rate in notebook PCs in calendar year '17, about 35% going toward over the course of next several years by 2020 time frame, getting to 75% attach rates. So a lot of HDD, that is still to be replaced with SSDs. And same trends are continuing in all markets for NAND. Average capacities are continuing to increase. So the demand trends continues to be very robust. For flash, yes, more supply environment, but we are very focused on continuing to strengthen our product portfolio and increase our share with respect to SSD markets as well as with more managed NAND solutions to address the mobile markets. And relative to the question about margins, I think there are 2 pieces of that. One, we are making progress toward a mix -- a higher value-added mix of solutions, and those typically carry the opportunity for higher margins. Also, we continue to make progress on the cost side with respect to increasing amounts of 3D NAND as well as TLC, and you had a good quarter for cost reduction as well. So it's a combination of both market facing with the higher value-add solutions, and then, a good quarter from an operational perspective relative to cost. Yes. I don't think we've said that we'd reach that gross debt target in FQ2. We said, by the end of our fiscal year. And so I wouldn't expect that we would achieve that level end fiscal Q2. The tax bill, as we understand it, would not necessarily change the priorities, which are always to continue to make sure we have the best technology we can in production and to be able to transition that at a time that makes sense for us. And then, for fiscal year '18, certainly, getting the balance sheet in shape relative to these aggregate levels of debt. Yes. Absolutely. Cloud and server, data center enterprise as well as cloud data centers absolutely will continue to be the biggest growth drivers at large volumes for the DRAM industry. And we have very strong penetration in these markets. And actually, we do expect to continue to build momentum in these markets going forward. It absolutely is. I mean, when you look at autonomous vehicles, they really are level 5 autonomous vehicles in the future are projected to have about 40 gigabyte of DRAM content in them. And when you think about it, that is very similar to the average capacity that's associated with servers -- in the server workstations, right? So these cars will be really very powerful computers in the future, and they are not only going to be driving tremendous amount of DRAM content usage, but they will also drive NAND Flash usage. They will be generating, using data to make millions of real-time split-second decisions to make sure that the passengers in the autonomous vehicles can be transported effortlessly and safely to their destination. There will be sensors from sonar to camera that will be generating billions of signals, and all of that data will have to be processed, accessed in order to make fast decisions. So you're absolutely right to note that this is really a secular trend here in front of us in terms of driving continued usage of memory and storage. Earlier, we talked about cloud and data center applications. And again, those are growing faster than the rest of the industry. Autonomous vehicles will be another big driver in the future. And Micron is uniquely positioned with a strong portfolio of solutions, both with flash solutions as well as DRAM memory solutions to address these fast-growing market trends. So in terms of content for server, I think 2017, if you look at flash, attach rate, it's about average capacity around 2.5 -- 2,500 gigabytes. And when you look at projection over 2018 timeframe going to anywhere above 3,000 gigabyte average capacity continues to march ahead by 2021 timeframe, almost tripling from the 2017 levels, well above 8,000 gigabytes as well. So that is on the SSD side. And similarly, on the DRAM side, average capacities continue to increase nicely there as well. In 2017, timeframe about 145 gigabytes per server average capacity estimated, and industry reports are showing that by 2021 timeframe going to about 350. So very strong solid and year-over-year increases, not just in near term, but again, as I say, these are secular trends here. As we introduce third-generation 3D NAND, we would continue to expect that, that technology of mature yield have -- or has favorable cost dynamics relative to 64-layer. We don't believe that it will have a significant positive or negative impact in our FY '18 results as we will just be implementing that as we get into the last quarter of the fiscal year. So it won't be material enough either way to change the fundamental dynamic that we're going to see this year, which is largely driven by our 64-layer TLC NAND. Well, in the value-added solution category, we count our SSDs index, and in fiscal Q1, we had really solid increase in our SSD revenues. We gained share in the market as well. In the mobile space, managed NAND solutions are also -- and discrete NAND solutions we consider as value-add as well. Our share in those markets today is relatively low, low single digits, but we see tremendous opportunity as we are continuing to diversify our product portfolio. And as we execute on that product road map in the quarters to come, we expect to be gaining -- making substantial progress. And of course, in the DRAM side, applications such as automotive, such as graphics, high-performance applications as they all contribute towards the value-add solution. We are not providing you any specifics at this point. We'll discuss more details at our Analyst Day in May. And let me just point out, in response to your previous question, that while we will provide more detail in May, but on a year-over-year basis, certainly, we are increasing our value-add solution mix substantially and very pleased with the progress that we are making. Regarding your second question on DRAM. DRAM really is a strategic enabler today in diversity of markets and the megatrends we talk about, whether it is data centers, cloud applications, being the fuel for AI engine, helping make decisions for various search algorithms as well as various activities in all verticals that are being pursued, leveraging AI in mobile space as more and more applications go toward augmented reality type of features in mobile requires more DRAM. DRAM is highly strategic. Even in the future, when you look at notebook computers, they will require the form factor and the low-power aspects, even in PCs of LPDRAM in future years to come. So you see -- and of course, we just talked about automotive as well. So now DRAM is addressing diversity of markets. I mean, several large diverse markets. Product portfolio, meeting the needs of these markets is becoming differentiated. And when that happens, that always gives you stronger opportunities to drive profitable growth in that market. And our customers, when we have an engagement with them, when we have dialogues with them, they are talking to us how memory, DRAM memory, is really now helping them solve the bottlenecks in their applications. So DRAM today is very different, as I've said many times before, from the DRAM in the PC-era only or when it was about just PC and mobile. Today, it is about many more applications of DRAM and really providing a very strategic enabling role in creating all these applications that are truly transforming the world right before our eyes. So about 80% of our output for the quarter just completed was on 3D. And over the course of the balance of fiscal '18, we'd expect that number to grow to about 95%. We expect that we will have some measure of bit growth, as we said. Each and every quarter, we said it would be, in the prepared remarks, a little more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. Yes. Yes. That output for the quarter was up in the low single-digit range. We work very closely with our customers, and we certainly work hard in terms of gaining visibility to their future requirements of DRAM and how their applications are shaping up so that we can make sure that our technology and product road map is addressing their needs. And this varies from customer to customer. Some customers tend to be more on a month by month basis, some more quarter, and some, certainly, longer-term engagements as well. And you're right to note that, yes, I mean, that the industry supply growing about 20% and demand likely to be somewhat higher. We do expect a healthy DRAM industry supply and demand environment and continue to work very closely to drive strategic growth of our revenue mix going forward. So of course, in terms of projecting, our industry bit growth estimates here, we, of course, are taking into consideration our estimate of the ramp of 64-layer technology in the industry and our assumptions around ramp of wafer production as well as yield ramp of that technology. And along with other mix of technologies in the industry as well. But you're right to note that the dominant factor of the supply bit growth in the industry will be with 64 layers here. And we continually look at our estimates and we review it, based on all the intelligence that we may have as well as we may collect from third-party reports, we define our models on an ongoing basis. And if we have any changes on this, we will share them with you. I think that we will continue to prioritize the -- supporting our latest generation technology in production. As we've talked about for fiscal '18, clearly focused on getting aggregate debt down in that $8 billion range. Those things will lead to, we believe, over time, improved ratings. I think how we think about deploying cash is not wholly dependent upon the achievement of any particular ratings grade. We just think these are things that will be worked in parallel. And at the appropriate time, I think we're very open to thinking about broader uses of cash, including shareholder return programs, so those do have a place in the hierarchy of thinking about uses of our cash. But until we get to the point where we have completed or substantively completed our work on this technology deployment and regaining cost competitiveness and also getting our aggregate debt levels to the -- to a level that we are more comfortable with, certainly, those will continue to remain our priority. Yes. Don't forget that the Compute and Networking Business Unit includes a wide array of products, which includes both client, but also includes data center, mobile -- I'm sorry, not mobile, but networking and other products as well. So it isn't just a statement about the client compute environment. And many of those subsegments within the Compute and Networking Business Unit we would also consider as strategically important. These are relationships where we have the opportunity to deploy both DRAM and NAND. And certainly, mobile continues to be important. So I wouldn't necessarily presume that the margin performance out of our Compute and Networking Business Unit is largely driven by the performance of client. I think, again, our estimates based -- for DRAM as well, are based on all the information from various sources and reports that we gather and we have put that here. I do think that even when you look at estimates by other suppliers, we are all pointing to fairly close, tightly-aligned, industry supply growth estimate here. And -- but this is our estimate. We will, as I said before for NAND, same thing. We routinely look at this very, very closely. And just also remember that the technology transitions in the industry today certainly are becoming increasingly complex, and they have greater capital intensity. As well as with advanced technology nodes, you are actually getting less bits on a per wafer basis even at mature yields compared to prior generation nodes. Again, given the scaling challenges, the increased complexity. So all of these trends are actually increased technology complexity and increased capital intensity have a moderating effect on the supply growth. Yes. I think, Sanjay mentioned earlier the diversification of the DRAM demand stream. And certainly, that is also true on the NAND side. And in the context of that diversified demand stream, for example, automobiles tend to be far less seasonal than client PCs. And if you look at data center deployments among all of the key players, there's certainly a specific pattern per customer. But when you put them all together, there is no macro seasonality pattern that emerges when you look at that. So as we've transitioned to these diversified demand drivers, the concept of seasonality, I think, has been redefined and is perhaps less impactive on a quarter by quarter basis than it may have been in the past. I mean, we are certainly not projecting pricing for fiscal year '18 here. But again, what I'll point to you is that if you look at the history of NAND, increase in technology capabilities, technology advances, which leads to cost reductions, ultimately enable opening up of many new market applications and drive the elasticity in many of these markets as well and drive the demand environment. So I consider it as healthy if the cost declines are greater than the price declines in the industry. That's a healthy industry environment. And while we don't get into the projection of pricing, again, when we look at all the demand drivers that are ahead of us, I spoke about it repeatedly in the call today, multitude of demand drivers and in each of these large market segments, again, whether it is about cloud data center, enterprise data center, mobile, smartphones, client notebook, automotive applications, all of these are continuing to drive strong demand trends for NAND Flash application. Yes. I think the one thing I would add to that as well is if you think about our statements around industry bit growth, which are approaching 50%, those would be associated, typically, with fairly healthy levels of cost reduction. We're not going to get into the specifics of what that might be, but it is important to remember that, that bit growth usually would be accompanied by some good cost reduction as well. So this is Ernie. The 3D XPoint CapEx and any associated R&D expenses, the CapEx piece is embedded in our nonvolatile estimates for the year, which we said was between 35% and 45% of our total spending. And as we look at that product, we're going to have to see how the markets develop, as Sanjay mentioned, before we provide any broader perspective on that. In terms of SSD share gain during the quarter, we believe we gained share both in client applications as well as enterprise and cloud data center applications. Really, our products did very well there. And at this point, our offerings are with SATA drive. And next year, we'll bring out our NVMe solution sometime during calendar year '18, and that should help us expand our portfolio and give us opportunities to continue to gain share in this market. And regarding our guidance that we have given you, of course, we have certain assumptions related to total demand. And our pricing assumptions are baked in there as well. But obviously, for competitive reasons, we do not get into discussions of pricing on the call. Yes. So if we're framing the scenario in the future as we continue to see sort of marginally declining pricing environment, a couple of points per quarter or so, I think there's ample room for gross margin expansion, both as a result of our cost reduction as well as the ongoing transition to high-value solutions, which would include redirecting -- continuing to redirect component sales into higher value-added solutions as well as some of our partner contracts wind down over the course of our fiscal '18 and into 2019. So I think in that pricing scenario that you've set forth, we believe there's reasonable room for gross margin expansion. Yes. I think, again, the same general story with respect to continuing to move towards higher value-add solutions. You heard Sanjay speak to, for example, increasing the breadth of our managed NAND offerings. If you look at server, that's certainly a very, very strong growth pattern here as well as automotive. So I think there are a number of segments where we would continue to expect to be able to optimize our bit output toward that would give us the best gross margin opportunity. And of course, even though our bit output growth is going to be lower in DRAM than NAND, we'd still expect to deliver some meaningful cost reduction there, as I articulated in the prepared remarks. So like you noted, in order to realize the technology transitions, you, of course, do need space in your cleanroom to deploy the tools that are required to implement the advanced technology nodes. So our fabs have had space here in terms of deploying the technology transitions, for example, in Singapore going from 32-layer to 64-layer. And in the past, in Singapore fab for NAND, going from planar to 3D nodes as well. And similarly, cleanroom space is something we look at very carefully for DRAMs as well because, as I just said, I mean, more cleanroom space is needed for technology transitions. So as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we do continue to assess the scenarios that are needed for future technology transitions, and I continue to assess our cleanroom space requirements. Fiscal year '18, we are not looking at any new wafer capacity additions. We are not looking at any new -- any meaningful new cleanroom space required to implement our technology transition plans in fiscal year '18. And as I said in my remarks, going beyond that, we continue to assess various scenarios to implement the requirements for technology transitions, both in DRAM as well as in NAND. No plans firmed up yet. And as and when we look at it, we will share these things. Remember, any time you build a new cleanroom, it takes several months to build, construct the building. And it takes a few months then to roll in equipment into the new cleanroom and to deploy the equipment, qualify it and build products. So these are things that are to be looked at for the longer-term horizon, and we are evaluating those scenarios.","A couple of questions on the NAND side. Sanjay, at least among the investor community, there seems to be some concerns that there's going to be a flood of supply coming online into the industry in the first half. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about what your view is about the supply/demand balance as we head into the first half. And then, for Ernie, the NAND gross margin improvement is 900 basis points, sequentially. I know you mentioned mix healthy there, but I'm just curious if you could provide some more color as to exactly what's driving that, and how sustainable that is going forward? And then, maybe just one follow-up, Ernie, on the balance sheet. I think you previously said your gross debt target is about $8 billion, which you said you're going to reach, I guess, next quarter. Given -- assuming that the tax bill will pass, is there any change to that target? And then, if you can talk about, again, assuming that the tax bill will pass, what's your priorities for cash going forward? On the DRAM side, you've got Intel ramping Skylake. You've got AMD ramping EPYC on the server CPU side. Cloud and hyperscale CapEx spending looks to grow about 30% next year. Given all of this, do you guys anticipate continued momentum and mix in your server and cloud business in DRAM to continue to move higher next year? And then, from an industry perspective, does the server and cloud segment become a bigger part of the DRAM consumption mix over the next 2 to 3 years overtaking mobile? Great. And Sanjay, you talked about semi and fully autonomous wins in the quarter. All of the major auto OEMs and self-systems guys are focused on this. We talked to one of the leading guys that's focused on sensors and processor technology required for these types of vehicles. They're talking about 25, 30 gigabytes of DRAM and 1 terabyte SSDs per car for level 4 and level 5 fully autonomous. That's a pretty significant step up in DRAM and NAND content. Is that consistent with how you see the content trends in automotive over the next kind of 3 to 5 years? A couple of questions. Maybe on DRAM, can you just go back to -- the servers been a huge driver, and that's really been without Intel's Purley's still the minority. Can you just maybe talk about content per server? How much that increased this year? And then, as you look into next year, how much of a driver is Purley as you look in the second half, and that being more meaningful? And then, just on the NAND side, I just want to go back to that prior question. Obviously, you're seeing a crossover at 64. How do you think about the cost trajectory here as you then start to ramp third gen as you look to the fiscal year, is there any sort of -- what's the slope of that cost curve as one is going up, and the other one's going down? You had mentioned when you gave your guidance for CapEx for the year about adding more value-added into your DRAMs and flash. Can you say what percentage right now would you call in a value-added group? And what's the goal for that? Okay. Great. Maybe just as one follow-up because especially a DRAM market had been such a commodity market, are you getting any pushback from your customers that they want you to move more towards a commodity? I'm not sure if you said it, but on the November quarter, how much of your total NAND production was 3D NAND? And as you transition to 64-layer in the February and May quarter next year, does your NAND production drop or grow sequentially? But you, nevertheless, will grow in the first half? I guess first question on DRAM. You talked about 20% bit supply for the industry in '18, which would suggest continued tightness throughout the whole year. So curious how customers are reacting to that reality. What kind of visibility are you seeing to pricing as well as extension to contracts? Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, on the NAND side, you're talking around 50% bit growth or approaching that for the industry. One or 2 of the other players in the market are expecting lower type of bit growth. So it would appear that you're making assumptions around the 64-layer ramp that might be a little bit more robust than your competitors. So curious, how are you thinking about that ramp? And clearly, I think you'd agree the risk is probably lower than 50%, how would you kind of, I guess, put a probability around where you think it truly ends up? I wonder, I know you don't want to get too far ahead of yourself on this, but when you get to sort of net cash neutral and you get to investment grade, what's next from a prioritization of free cash flow? And how do you just qualitatively think about cash return versus maintaining cash for more strategic uses? Great. And then, I wondered, the disparity between the 60% operating margins in your compute business and mobile, which are still quite high, I guess, to me, sort of you can see that PC DRAM still quite a bit more profitable than mobile. How do you think about that going forward in terms of your allocation of mix? Obviously, mobile gives you more stability down the road versus the upside that you can get from PCs. How are you thinking about that balance? Sanjay, some of your equipment -- semicap equipment suppliers have -- this is like over the last 3 months, have been raising their spending forecast for 2018, driven in part by higher DRAM investments. And my question is, what's the risk that your competitors, perhaps, are going more aggressively for share and that the 20% growth assumption you laid out for next year may actually end up proving conservative? And then, just on the February quarter, I don't know if you guys look at your individual periods on a seasonal basis, but it seems like the February quarter typically is a down quarter and you're guiding to sequential growth off of a better-than-expected November period. What's driving the better-than-normal seasonality for you? Is it pricing or other factors as well? Two questions. First, if NAND ASPs continue to decline from rising supply, do you expect cost reduction to keep pace with the ASP decline as we look at fiscal '18? And then, I have a follow-up. Okay. Fair enough. Then, on 3D XPoint, I was wondering how much are you earmarking for spending in fiscal '18? And has there been customers who have identified? And how should we think, generally, on a big picture, about pricing there? Two quick questions for me. First of all, you mentioned the market share gains in SSDs and I assumed some of that was related to fixing the component issue. But can you sort of give us some more color on where you think specifically you had most success in gaining share? And then, secondly, I know you're not going to talk specifically about pricing for the upcoming quarter, but if you could, maybe, qualify some more how you get to your sales guidance in terms of pricing and mix, that would be helpful. Ernie, maybe I can ask the gross margin question around NAND a little bit differently. I'm just kind of curious, given that you guys had significant gross margin upside on pricing down low single digits sequentially, under a scenario where pricing continues to decline, let's say, at a low single-digit rate sequentially, is there enough mix and cost opportunity for you to maintain and/or grow gross margins from here? Or how should we think about the parameters that you're able -- being able to maintain or grow gross margins relative to your cost and mix availability from here? That's helpful. And a similar question on the DRAM front. You mentioned in your prepared comments that you expect more DRAM bit growth in the first half of your fiscal year than the second half. As we transition into the second half, how much -- how many levers do you have on the mix side in DRAM to be able to progress sort of gross margins higher from here? I had a question on CapEx and capacity. So Micron -- you stepped up the CapEx quite a bit this year from previous years. But still, quite significantly underspending some of the rivals, particularly Samsung. My question, actually, is about how is Micron thinking about the need for fabs longer term. This is more of a kind of longer-term question, because both Samsung and Hynix are building brand-new greenfield fabs as we speak. What is the status right now for Micron in both DRAM and NAND in terms of how much space you have available to you in DRAM and NAND? And I understand your goal is to keep wafer capacity roughly flat and grow gigabytes from technology migration. At what point do you need more fab space to keep that fab capacity roughly flat? Or it is, of course, more layers requires more fab space, and of course, as you shrink DRAM, you also need more fab space as well. So do you have any plans for new fabs? What would be the plan? And how are you thinking about that? PRELIMINARY TRANSCRIPT: ""Preliminary Transcript"" indicates that the Transcript has been published in near real-time by an experienced professional transcriber.

Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you for my first Micron quarterly earnings call, and I'm particularly fortunate to be joining at a time when we are able to report record revenues and non-GAAP EPS. These results reflect healthy industry fundamentals, the strength of Micron's diversified technology and product portfolio and our broad customer reach. Micron also continues to make progress in improving its technology and product competitiveness. The current industry dynamic and the growing strategic importance of Micron's technologies and capabilities make this an exciting time to join the company. The unprecedented amount of data being created, stored and processed presents tremendous opportunities for Micron. Applications like autonomous driving, machine learning and big data analytics all promise to make an enormous impact on our lives. Memory and file storage are the critical and increasingly strategic elements in every one of these applications. Market-leading companies from a broad array of industries who provide data center services, automotive applications and mobile solutions, just to name a few, are eager to partner with innovative companies like Micron that can provide leading-edge technology and system solutions. Micron is uniquely positioned with the right technologies and capabilities to take a leadership position, and I'm delighted to have the opportunity to help the company maximize this potential. I will now share some details from each of our business units, followed by technology and operational highlights for the quarter. Finally, I'll share our perspective on current industry supply and demand dynamics. We had record revenues in all business units this quarter, nearly doubling our company level year-over-year revenue performance. In the Compute and Networking Business Unit, all segments posted significant gains from year-ago levels. Revenue from cloud customers was more than 4x higher year-over-year. And we saw increased enterprise demand as analytics workloads are driving more use of in-memory databases and higher server memory content. We continue to build upon our strong position in graphics and high-performance memory technology, with shipments of our 12 gigabits per second GDDR5X, the industry's fastest discrete DRAM, which we successfully ramped to high volume during the quarter. Most CNBU revenue came from 20-nanometer DRAM products, and we also recognized initial revenue on our next-generation 1x DDR4 products. Looking forward, we believe that we are well positioned to effectively serve both our traditional OEM customer base as well as evolving opportunities around tailored solutions for large data center customers. Our Mobile Business Unit revenue increased slightly quarter-over-quarter with significant margin expansion, driven by lower costs associated with the continued shift to 20-nanometer LPDRAM and the favorable pricing environment. We expect increased demand ahead of the anticipated flagship smartphone introductions planned for the fall. Requirements for multicamera systems, augmented reality applications and high-resolution displays now dictate 4- and 6-gigabyte LPDRAM densities for a great user experience. This demand aligns well with our 20-nanometer and 1x offerings, where we plan to introduce nearly 20 new 1x package-on-package variations in the next 12 months. We are focused on developing and diversifying our MCP and discrete NAND device offerings, which will position us well to address the full range of smartphones, from basic entry-level smartphones to content-rich high-end devices. Many mobile OEM customers prefer MCPs in their design implementation to address their memory and storage requirements, as MCPs provide a single source for DRAM memory and NAND storage, simplifying system design, validation and supply chain considerations. We continue to sample our 32-layer MLC and TLC 3D NAND MCP, discrete eUFS and eMMC devices to both chipset partners and handset OEMs. Revenue shipments of these products will begin later in the second half of this calendar year following completion of qualifications by customers. Our Embedded Business Unit recorded a 44% increase in revenue year-over-year, driven by strong demand growth across all segments and a better pricing environment. We achieved record quarterly revenue for each of the automotive, consumer and connected home and industrial segments. We saw continued strength in automotive DRAM and eMMC NAND with infotainment and instrument cluster applications driving this record level. We continue to maintain our strong market share leadership position in automotive, enabled by our focus on high quality and deep customer relationships and support. Industrial and consumer-connected home revenues were led by increased shipments into rapidly growing applications, such as voice-activated home assistance and set-top boxes. We continue to transition our nonautomotive DRAM portfolio onto 20-nanometer designs. Our Storage Business Unit delivered record revenues as sales of our SSD products grew 33% quarter-over-quarter. Sales to cloud and enterprise SSD customers grew appreciably on a combined basis and exceeded revenue from client customers for the first time. The most significant growth came from our cloud customers, where revenue doubled quarter-over-quarter. Our SSD sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our SATA SSD solutions using our 32-layer TLC 3D NAND. During the quarter, we had first revenue shipments of our 8-terabyte SATA enterprise-class SSD, which is an industry first. Several new OEM and hyperscale customer qualifications are underway for our SATA drives. And in calendar year 2018, we plan to introduce NVMe PCIe offerings using our 64-layer TLC 3D NAND. On the manufacturing operations front, we continue to make good progress toward achieving meaningful output by the end of our fiscal year on both our 64-layer 3D NAND and our 1X DRAM. Both of these technologies have already begun revenue shipments and are advancing well in their production yield run. We also continue to execute our plans to outfit our assembly operations as part of our DRAM center of excellence in Taiwan. This DRAM center, in addition to our NAND center of excellence in Singapore, will be essential to our ongoing efforts to optimize costs and improve our flexibility and speed to meet customer needs. On the technology front, we continue to make solid progress on the development of our third-generation 3D NAND and our next-generation 1Y DRAM technologies. Our third-generation 3D NAND will continue to be based on our innovative CMOS Under the Array architecture. This architecture, pioneered by Micron, provides the benefits of smaller die size and lower cost. We expect our 1y DRAM to further improve our competitive position in the industry. Looking at the industry broadly, Micron continues to see a healthy supply and demand environment that creates opportunities across both memory and storage markets. For calendar 2017, we expect DRAM industry bit supply growth of between 15% and 20%, slightly below our view of demand growth. For NAND, we expect 2017 industry supply growth in the high 30% to low 40% range, constraining what would otherwise be higher demand. We expect healthy industry demand to persist into 2018, supported by continued strong growth in both DRAM and NAND demand, reflecting broader trends in the data center and mobile markets as well as increased adoption of SSDs across enterprise, cloud and client PCs. Finally, after my first 2 months at Micron, I would like to share some of my priorities. Our execution and competitiveness are my primary focus, particularly accelerating the ramp of new technologies into volume production and introducing new products quickly, both of which are essential to developing innovative solutions at lower costs and strengthening Micron's business fundamentals. Micron has a tremendous portfolio of technologies and core capabilities. Our goal is to leverage these to provide high-value products and solutions that improve our revenue mix. We will target high-growth opportunities and seek out partnerships with leading companies in the ecosystem to position Micron for long-term success. We are off to a good start. Our execution and the current business climate are creating more flexibility, which we are leveraging to solidify our foundation through technology, product and manufacturing investments while also strengthening our balance sheet. I believe that through focus and solid execution, Micron can capitalize on the world's increasing reliance on memory and storage solutions. I'll now turn it over to Ernie, who will walk through the specifics of our financial performance this quarter. Thank you, Sanjay. We had a strong quarter with record revenue, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow, driven by the continued positive industry environment, additional bit growth from our current technologies and progress on deploying our next-generation technologies into manufacturing. I will provide an overview of the fiscal Q3 results by technology and business unit, followed by comments on our overall corporate financial performance and guidance for FQ4. DRAM represented 64% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: Mobile was in the mid-20% range; PC was in the low 20% range, down from the prior quarter; server represented approximately 30%, up from 25% the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, automotive and other embedded technologies, was in the mid-20% range. Our trade NAND revenue represented 31% of total revenue with the following segmentation: consumer, which consists primarily of component sales to partners and customers, was approximately 40%; mobile, which includes managed NAND discrete solutions and the majority of our MCPs, was in the mid-teens percent range; SSDs were in the mid-20% range, up slightly from last quarter; and automotive, industrial and other embedded applications were in the high-teens percent range. Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit reported fiscal Q3 revenue of $2.4 billion, up 25% sequentially due to increased bit shipments, ongoing success in penetrating growing segments like enterprise, graphics and high-performance memory and cloud and a stronger pricing environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion or 51% of revenue, up from 38% the prior quarter. 20-nanometer products were greater than half of CNBU revenue and were shipped primarily in the enterprise, cloud and client segments. Revenue growth in the enterprise segment was driven by the continued expansion of DRAM content per server. And in the cloud space, we experienced good sequential bit growth. Both segments also benefited from the current pricing environment. We saw ongoing growth of our 20-nanometer DDR4 products, with particular strength coming from the latest industry server platforms. In networking, we saw shipment and revenue growth bolstered by the continued transition to 20-nanometer 4-gigabit DDR3 and 8-gigabit DDR4 products. We also continue to see strong interest in our high-performance memory portfolio. This strength was primarily evident in data center networking equipment. Double-digit client revenue growth was driven by a continued firm pricing environment and product mix optimization, resulting in modestly declining bit shipments. Our 1x nanometer revenue was predominantly in this segment. Graphics also saw double-digit revenue growth, driven by strength in the game console market as well as new PC graphics card product launches, including the G5x-based Titan Xp from NVIDIA. The Mobile Business Unit delivered fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.1 billion, up 4% sequentially, driven primarily by a stronger pricing environment. And our non-GAAP operating income was $304 million or 27% of revenue, up from 16% the prior quarter. The Embedded Business Unit delivered fiscal Q3 revenue of $700 million, up 19% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $256 million or 37% of revenue, up from 33% the prior quarter. The results were driven by strong bit demand and increased average selling prices of DRAM, combined with record shipments of SLC and MLC NAND in the consumer and connected home segments and record shipments of DRAM and eMMC NAND into the industrial and automotive segments, respectively. The Storage Business Unit delivered fiscal Q3 revenue of $1.3 billion, up 26% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $276 million or 21% of revenue, up from 7% the prior quarter. The results were primarily driven by strong unit growth of SSDs and a stronger pricing environment Moving to overall company results. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $5.6 billion, up 20% sequentially and driven by, primarily, stronger DRAM ASPs and higher NAND bit volumes. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 92%, primarily due to a stronger DRAM pricing environment, increased bit volumes in both DRAM and NAND and our focus on higher value-add solutions to improve our product mix. Examples of this improved mix includes SSDs where year-on-year revenue tripled, while in DRAM bits embedded in high-value solution for enterprise, cloud and graphics customers, together grew at a rate twice our overall DRAM bit output for the same period. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 48%, up from 38.5% in the prior quarter, driven by increased DRAM ASPs and cost per bit reductions in both DRAM and NAND. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP gross margin increased 30 percentage points, driven by a stronger DRAM pricing environment, a better product mix and lower cost per bit in both DRAM and NAND. Non-GAAP net income was $1.9 billion or $1.62 per share. Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue increased 20% compared to the prior quarter as a result of a 5% increase in bit shipments and a 14% increase in ASPs. DRAM non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter increased 10 percentage points sequentially to 54%, driven by a 6% cost per bit reduction and better product mix. As a reminder, we noted last quarter that second half fiscal year 2017 DRAM bit output would be about 10% higher than first half fiscal year 2017. As we look forward into fiscal 2018, the timing of the 1x technology transition is expected to result in our bit growth at or slightly below industry growth rates over the same period. We considered this bit growth pattern when we provided our 2-year bit growth CAGR earlier this year. Trade NAND revenue increased 21% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting a 17% increase in bit shipments and a 3% increase in ASPs. Non-GAAP gross margin was 41%, up 10 percentage points, driven by a 12% cost per bit reduction and better product mix. As a reminder, we noted last quarter that second half fiscal year 2017 bit growth would be about 30% above first half fiscal year 2017. Based on the timing of technology transitions, we foresee relatively muted bit growth in the first half of fiscal 2018, followed by stronger growth in the second half. Consistent with DRAM, we considered this bit growth pattern when we provided our 2-year bit growth CAGRs earlier in the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $600 million, down $12 million from the prior quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion in fiscal Q3 compared to $389 million in the year-ago period. During the quarter, we deployed $1.3 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions. And free cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion as we retired approximately $1 billion of debt via a tender offer for certain of our high-yield notes. We currently expect fiscal year 2017 free cash flow of approximately $3 billion and continue to prioritize the deployment of our cash flow toward advancing our production technology capabilities and reducing our debt. For fiscal year 2017, we are trending to the upper end of our indicated net CapEx range of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. We will provide a fiscal year 2018 CapEx perspective later this year. We ended the third quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $4.9 billion. Our guidance for fiscal Q4 is informed by our view of sustained, healthy supply and demand dynamics, our ongoing work around cost reduction and the improvement of our product mix. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: revenue in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion; gross margin in the range of 47% to 51%; operating expenses between $575 million and $625 million; and operating income ranging between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. EPS will range between $1.73 and $1.87 per share, based on 1,179 million diluted shares At our Analyst Day in February, we outlined how our production technology execution and the result in bit growth and cost reductions have enabled us to significantly strengthen our cash flow and financial performance in any market conditions. We've been reporting our incremental progress each quarter. However, I wanted to share the tremendous progress we've made over the 12-month period ending in fiscal Q3. During that time, our bit output has been above industry average for both DRAM and trade NAND, and our cost per bit has declined approximately 25% and 30% in those technologies, respectively. In addition, we continue to improve our competitiveness by successfully delivering solutions to deliver higher value-add opportunities. Our ability to deliver these results has enhanced our energy and excitement to make further progress, and we look forward to sharing that with you. With that, I will turn it back to Sanjay. Thank you, Ernie. Last week we announced that Sumit Sadana joined Micron as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer, a role that unites our 4 business units and our strategy and business development team into a single organization. This structure will better equip us to align our product strategies to market trends and customer demands. Sumit brings nearly 3 decades of industry experience. He's a proven leader in driving strategy and building businesses with a focus on high-value profitable growth. Sumit has a successful track record at multiple large technology companies, and his perspective and expertise make him an ideal fit for Micron. Earlier this week, we also announced that Jeff VerHeul has joined Micron as Senior Vice President of Non-Volatile Engineering. Jeff has extensive experience in leading the development of advanced semiconductor products, including flash system-level solutions. I look forward to Jeff's contributions in advancing Micron's road map of flash memory technology and value-added products. We welcome both Sumit and Jeff to Micron. Finally, I would like to express gratitude to my predecessor, Mark Durcan. His dedication and leadership have positioned Micron well for this next chapter of success. As I have toured Micron's facilities and met with leaders and teams throughout the company and have begun to engage with some of our customers, I have been impressed by the strength of our technologies, scale, customer reach and the innovative, hard-working spirit of our global team. My experience since joining Micron has reinforced what I have known for a long time. This company has tremendous potential and can become one of the world's most successful semiconductor companies. I'm proud to be part of this iconic company. We will now open for questions.","Well, Micron team actually has already been, as we said in our remarks, working on driving our high-value solutions mix to greater levels in its portfolio. The company has made strong progress over a couple of quarters in client SSDs as well as enterprise and cloud SSDs. And if you look at some of the market share numbers, you will see that the market share over last couple of quarters has increased meaningfully. The market share in enterprise cloud stands at sub-10% levels. And in client markets for SSDs, the market share is in high single digits at this point. So all this definitely points to much greater opportunity for the company in the times ahead. And key things that we have to focus on, this is absolutely an area of my priority here, is to increase the mix of system-level solutions in the NAND portfolio of the company. Things that have been going well, continue to build on them, but expand, diversify our capabilities, our product portfolio and deepen our customer engagements. The thing that's really, really powerful for Micron here is that Micron has strong position in DRAM as well as NAND. And basically on the continent, this is the only company that has these strong capabilities, therefore, customers are very much engaged with us in helping us drive the strength in the system-level solutions on the NAND side. In the areas where we have to focus on, to answer your question further, certainly, we continue to strengthen our controller capabilities as well as firmware capabilities. Today, some of them -- most of them are based on external controllers, and we have a road map of both external and internal controllers going ahead. So these will be an important area of focus for the company going forward. I don't think so. I think it's a function of the pattern of our bit growth over the course of this year. So while we will continue to enjoy cost reduction in the final quarter of this fiscal year, it's going to be likely at a bit of a slower rate than you've experienced for the first part of the year. And also as we look at the pricing environment, we continue to view supply and demand in a favorable way. But bear in mind, we've now had several consecutive quarters of nice quarter-over-quarter step-ups. And it isn't always advisable to bank on continued aggressive quarter-on-quarter pricing increases as you think about the business. The server demand definitely continues to be strong for DRAM. If you look at the growth for DRAM content combined with the unit server increases, the growth -- bit growth rate that we are looking at for the industry is about 40% on a year-over-year basis. So this is really high-value segment of the market. And certainly as you know, that industry in 2017 is experiencing overall tightness on the DRAM side, driven primarily by the strong growth on markets such as server as well as other markets like mobile continuing to be very strong, where the average capacities of DRAM content is increasing, given all the features that the phones are implementing, and even markets like automobile where DRAM content continues to increase nicely. So the demand trends are being driven by multiple markets. Certainly server is the highest growth trend in the marketplace today, and that's all for the DRAM side of the business. So I think when you look at the content of DRAMs in the mobile market, it really continues to increase nicely going in various smartphones from about a little over a gigabyte per phone to about doubling by 2018 time frame, so continued strong growth in terms of average capacity. And the same trend is certainly happening on the high-end phones too, where you are starting to see 4- and 6-gigabyte DRAM content. And certainly on the multichip packages also, we are seeing high-DRAM content as well as high-NAND content being driven in the mobile phone market. So overall, when you look at year-over-year trends in 2017 as well as when you look at the trajectory in 2018, mobile does continue to be a strong market. Certainly, there can be periods where there can be some inventory adjustments in certain parts of the market, but the important thing to focus on is really the long-term trend. And that trend, due to all the features that are being implemented, even in the entry-level smartphones and certainly on the high-end smartphones, are tending to drive higher average content and demand growth for DRAM as well as for NAND. I think as I mentioned in my earlier remark, we are still seeing some adjustments upward in certain segments of the market, certainly in terms of a frequency and magnitude. Those are a little less than we've experienced in the prior few quarters, Mark. Yes, I think it's important to remember that, that cost reduction was a 2-year CAGR. And certainly you'd expect with the kind of bit growth that we've experienced in our fiscal '17, that you would be at the upper end or above the upper end of that range. And if you go back and look at our fiscal '16, we were below. So it's important to blend those 2 years together. But the answer would get you to fairly significant cost reductions this year, commensurate with the type of bit growth that we've spoken of. So regarding the third generation, we will provide you more details as we get closer to production of that technology, obviously for competitive reasons. So there hasn't been a significant change during this period of time. Typically, as you noted, PC DRAM contracts are the shortest. We would actually say maybe a little longer than 2 weeks, but certainly roughly in the realm of a month or so. And then the other technologies tend to go up from there. But we haven't seen any material change in the duration as a result of the current market environment. Although there may be some requests for that, it's typically not something that gets changed very much over the course of a cycle. Our focus in DRAM is to continue to advance our technology and to ramp the new technology nodes into production as quickly as we can, keeping in mind our customer requirements. And there, of course, qualification of products built using those technologies. And we always keep an eye on overall demand and supply balance and our own demand and supply balance as well, so basically prudent focus on supply growth management. But the primary focus, the one that provides highest return on investments is around technology transitions. And that's where really all our priorities will be. In terms of any new capacity, I mean, we would certainly have to first make sure that we have captured the maximum potential of our technology transition capability in manufacturing. And then we'll have to certainly see that there is sustained projection or sustained demand growth in the years ahead before we consider adding new capacity. Sure. So Sanjay and I may team up for this, but relative to gigs shift or the volume shift into the PC segment, as we said in our prepared remarks, we did have a slight decline in unit volume. It wasn't very significant at all, but that was part of our plan to address higher value-added markets. I don't think it was reflective of a decreased demand environment in any way, shape or form. We don't typically comment on the going-forward pricing environment, other than the general statement that we see fairly good balance between supply and demand. And we're going to continue to monitor that segment quite carefully from a bit growth perspective. I think we're thinking that, that segment would be somewhere in the range of plus low to mid-single digits in aggregate for us in fiscal '17. And I think that, that addresses the 3 points you raised, but if not, please let us know. In terms of driving our growth ahead, of course, we have several tools available to us: our technology and product capabilities, our engagement with customers and our ability on the manufacturing side in terms of implementing the new technologies into production. We would never rule out any M&A. If and when appropriate, we will absolutely consider it, but it would have to be something that does provide ROI. So we just want to make sure that we focus on our priorities. And our priorities at this point are to strengthen our technology and product execution and increase the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio mix while engaging with customers on defining the future-generation architectures. So again, I don't rule out any M&A, but it, of course, always has to be considered in the context of what value it brings and what ROI it brings. We've mentioned earlier in the year that one of the biggest variables in terms of the quarterly level of OpEx is something we call pre-qual expense. So as we are going through the process of qualifying either new packages or new technologies for customers, those carry with them significant expenses. When we went into this fiscal year, we suggested that it would be more heavily weighted toward the front part of the fiscal year, and you've seen that play out here as our operating expenses have flattened out. As we look forward, we're considering OpEx as part of our fiscal year 2018 planning process, and we're not quite through that. So I think we'll be in a position to share a little bit more color on that with you on the next call. But we are, as always, very mindful of operating expenses and operating expense progression, so we're taking a very close look at that. So at this point, we are not prepared to really lay out mix targets for the future. But I can certainly tell you that, indeed, there is great opportunity, over time, to strengthen the mix of the managed NAND solutions. That means SSDs as well as in the mobile space, things like eMMC and UFS and MCP. And again, I would like to point out that there's a large part of mobile market which demands MCP, and Micron is very well positioned with this mix of DRAM and flash. So we will definitely to focus on bringing up solution, more MCP solutions using our eMMC and UFS capabilities in the future. I would like to point out that these kind of transitions do take a period of time. Micron is, I would say, still in the early days of implementing this transition. Over an extended period of time, we definitely will be driving the mix, but it really has excessive focus of the entire leadership team here. And with the hire of Jeff VerHeul, we have certainly doubled down in this area in terms of focusing further on system-level solutions for NAND. As you know, I will also just add that in terms of the component side of things, that includes some of the sales that the company makes to Intel, which as you know, is our partner in terms of development, so that's part of that component mix that you were talking about as well. Sure. So consistent with one of the earlier answers, we are in the middle of our planning process for fiscal '18. And certainly, as we look at some of the priorities of the company, they have always been highly centered around continuing to drive our costs down. So despite the fact that we have been, to some degree, mindful of that in the context of the cash flow of the company in the past, we're going to continue to do the right thing and be prudent and disciplined in that regard. We have ample opportunity to reduce the debt profile of the company. So I appreciate you thinking we're flush with cash. We're still not as flush as I would like to be. So that's going to continue to be a priority of about generating that free cash flow as well as reducing the debt. So consistent with our prepared remarks, those are the 2 things we're focused on. And you will continue to see us be very thoughtful in how we pursue both of those here as we enter our fiscal year 2018. We certainly do think that, that will -- as it gets launched, it will be driving greater demand, certainly for bits, yes. I would expect it to be increasing over time. I think it's important to remember that was a long-term target. And that there are years when we've been below. There are other years when we've been above. And so I don't know that, relative to a long-term target, that we would be prepared to be making any changes at this point. But by the same token -- and if we do, certainly, as we did earlier last year, we'll share that with you. But at present time, that target remains the same, bearing in mind that it is a long-term target. And I would agree with Ernie that the long-term target here is definitely, I think, very appropriately placed. I think it's obviously a combination of both. But we've been saying for some time, Joe, that this is a priority of the company to really become stronger in segments where we have the opportunity to develop deeper relationships, offer higher value add, more sustained customer relationships. And I think we've done a great job at executing on that strategy. So while there is absolutely a benefit from pricing, absolutely, we enjoyed the same benefit that others did. From the average content increase, I think we enjoyed a disproportional benefit by executing on our strategy of addressing these markets in ways that allow us to get deeper penetration. Certainly, we have, I believe, strong opportunities in technology transitions to meet the future growth expectations. As I said in a response to an earlier question as well that we definitely will have to be exploiting that fully before we would ever consider any capacity additions. And you are certainly right that the demand drivers certainly are the AI, the machine learning. There's so much data being generated. And all of that data required to be processed fast to provide a great experience to consumers as well as bring great value to businesses to enable and unleash new applications. Just as all AI in the technology space is just extremely early days and extremely dynamic. And definitely, memory and storage will become, I believe, a key enabler for the capabilities that AI technology will be able to enable in multitude of applications, whether it is autonomous driving or it is cloud computing, a variety of applications here. So yes, I mean, the demand outlook here certainly is very interesting. But again, we just do not want to be getting ahead of ourselves. I think it is important that we stay focused on continuing to drive the business with a focus on prudent supply growth here. Well, I think as we noted, we are making progress every single quarter with penetrating higher value-add solutions. And we would expect, if we are successful in continuing to execute on that, that we would be in a position to have greater revenue from those segments which may, depending on the pricing environment, to some degree, mitigate a little bit the bit growth profile. But bear in mind, John, that we talk about our bit growth in the context of an industry that we're estimating, but we also used the words at or slightly below, not materially below. So I do think it's important to keep that in mind. And on the NAND front, we just simply said would have a little slower growth in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year. I wouldn't expect that we were going to be dramatically different or so underperforming the industry that it would disadvantage the company. So as you look through calendar '18, we will certainly be continuing to ramp our 1x DRAM technology as well as our 64-layer technology during the course of that time frame, where we are still in early stages, as we said. We'll be achieving meaningful output of both 1x as well as 64-layer this quarter here. But we continue to be ramping it during the course of the next several quarters. In terms of the bit growth, 20-nanometer provided something like, let's say, 40%, slightly greater than that in terms of bit growth compared to the prior node and gave us a cost reduction of more than 20%. And then you look at 1X compared to 20-nanometer, that's also in that same range, although 1X gives us somewhat greater cost reduction than 20-nanometer node gave us over the prior 25-nanometer node. And when we go to 32-layer compared to the planar NAND that we had -- that we have here at Micron, the last generation of planar NAND, 32-layer gave us a bit growth in volume die of about 100% or so and gave us a cost reduction of greater than -- in the range of maybe sub-30%. And going from 32-layer to 64-layer, bits gained is also about 100%. And cost reduction going from 32-layer to 64-layer is also -- at mature yields, comparing mature yield to mature yield and high volume wafer product to high-volume product, 32-layer to 64-layer will also give us about a 30% cost reduction. So Micron has been really well positioned in NAND with the 32-layer technology, which has given it meaningful cost reduction over our last planar node. And 64-layer continues that trend ahead as well. And, Jagadish, just to add to that, I would refer you back to some of the 2-year cost reduction CAGRs we provided at our Analyst Day, which gives you a view of fiscal '17 and '18 together. So that might be helpful to you as well as you think about that. We think that channel inventories are well within the range that we would consider to be normal. Certainly, they have improved from a quantity point of view over the first part of this year where they were extremely, extremely short. But in aggregate, I think that -- we think that channel inventory levels are still within healthy ranges. And I just want to add a comment to my response before to you. Your question was very specific in terms of cost reductions between technology nodes on high-volume products, essentially. And that -- those numbers should not be confused with year-over-year cost reductions, because year-over-year cost reductions on the overall blend of the business are very much a function of the technology mix that is in production. And as I indicated, these technologies will be gradually ramping up for us in production over the course of next several quarters, while the older technologies will still continue to be in production to meet our overall diversified customer requirements for a diversified mix of technology and product and solutions. C.J., we think the industry for calendar '18 could be slightly higher than the range of growth in calendar '17, which was this 15% to 20%. So maybe add a couple of percentage points to either end of the range. And we haven't shared yet a bit crossover for the 1X node. But we've said we'd have meaningful output by the end of the fiscal year. We're clearly on track to do that. And we'll provide more perspective on that as we more fully describe our 2018 plans. So just to make sure we're on the same page, we had given a range this year of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. And we said we were trending toward that $5.2 billion range. So it's just a couple of hundred million dollars. And I would say that, really, there is no specific area that I would point you toward. It's just doing what we need to do to make sure we're well set up here as we exit the end of the fiscal year.","Sanjay, welcome to the team. First question is for you. At the time that SanDisk was acquired by Western Digital, SanDisk had a #2 position in the global SSD markets, strong #3 position in enterprise SSD. I think you were growing that business about 15% to 20% year-over-year. If I look at the most recent market share stats, Micron is sitting at about a #5 market share position in both total SSD and enterprise SSD market share. So in what areas does the Micron team really have to focus on in order to drive a leadership position in SSD, especially enterprise? Is it systems capability, firmware, controller, OEM and cloud relationships? And more importantly, what are you going to do to start to enable this? Great. And then, Ernie, for you on the gross margin front, solid job over the team -- by the team over the past few quarters. Going forward, you're looking for about another 100 basis points of improvements. The demand environment is shaping up to be stronger second half over first half. Supply outlook still seems pretty disciplined, and the team is doing a great job on driving the cost curves. So it seems like your gross margin expansion should be greater than the implied 100 basis points you're guiding to. Are there any mix-related impacts in Q4 which is holding back the margin profile? This is Wayne Loeb on for Chris Danely. Can you talk about any changes you're seeing in server demand trends? Is it possible that we'll see allocation or lead time expansion in this market? Okay. Can I ask you for a little bit more color on what you're seeing as far as handset demand trends? What has the impact been from China inventory correction? And also, what you anticipate the impact will be of high-end SKUs of a flagship phone being delayed? First question is on DRAM ASPs. On the last earnings call, the company commented about how some of the contracts that have been in place for a while hadn't caught up with the substantial increase in spot pricing. And I'm wondering to what extent you expect a similar dynamic to play out as you think about the August quarter. Okay. That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question, the NAND gross margins expanded very significantly, and the company did very well on the cost per bit reduction, down 12% quarter-on-quarter. I know, Ernie, you said, we shouldn't expect cost reductions to come in every quarter at those sorts of rates, but it seems like the company's on track to exceed the 20% to 25% cost target that had guided you for NAND business for this year. And I'm just wondering to what extent you think you have the ability to exceed that prior guidance, given how much you've already accomplished. Or is there maybe other factors like mix that we need to keep in mind for the August quarter on the NAND business on cost? Can you give us a bit more detail on 3D NAND, the third generation versus the second generation? You've somewhat answered it in terms of the cost, but just looking specifically at third to second generation, how much cost savings do you get and reduction in cost per bit? And does third generation have more layers or a narrower line width or both? Can you say what's happening with your contract periods? It used to be PC DRAMs were negotiated every 2 weeks. I'm sure that customers are asking for extensions on those contracts. Can you just say, in general, what's your average contract time now? Okay, great. And maybe just if you could give us your views on adding more DRAM wafer capacity, what would stimulate that? Or what would be your decision to ever add wafer capacity on DRAM? Question on PC segment, Ernie, I think you said PC is down. I just want to make sure it's not down in absolute terms. It doesn't look like it, but just want to make sure. And then if can you comment on what sort of demand trends you are seeing in PC and also the pricing trends last quarter? Yes, that's great. That's helpful. And then in terms of the cash usage, Ernie, I think in the past, you said it's mostly -- your top priority is to pay off the debt or at least reduce the debt load. And obviously, very strong free cash flow here, and then really given Sanjay's comments about the enterprise SSD focus, et cetera, I'm just curious as to if and where M&A might come in, if I kind of take a longer-term view here. Ernie, just on OpEx that's been coming in lower than anticipated, I think, for a few quarters and in light of kind of your new product strategies and the upcoming fiscal year, can you give us just some advice on how to think about OpEx? Okay, great. And then, Sanjay, when the announcement was made that you were joining, I think some of us, at least the initial reaction was that there was a lot of potential to improve the mix within NAND. And so sort of seeing consumer at 40% of the business, SSDs kind of in the mid-20s, where do you think you can take the mix of business within NAND? And how long would it take for you to get it where you want? Ernie, I just wanted to go back to a prior answer you had. When you look -- obviously, I feel bad asking. Your cash flow obviously has grown hugely over the last couple quarters. I mean, you look at these, the cash in the next fiscal year, it wasn't that long ago people were asking how you're going to pay for CapEx, and now you're flush with cash. So I was just kind of curious your thought process. You pulled in a little in terms of transition, but it's only $200 million. Just kind of if you weigh those options in terms of faster transitions, capacity adds, buybacks as well as the debt retirement, which you did this quarter? And then I just want follow up on the computing strength in terms of, the next platform from Intel has more memory. Can you just maybe talk about that as a demand driver, and did that contribute? Did you see anything in terms of the builds ahead of that launch, which is more second half of this calendar year? Is that more -- did you see any contribution yet? Or is that something that will be more next fiscal year? Just to follow on, on the last question. In terms of CapEx trajectory, you've talked about a long-term number that sort of, it will be centered around 30% of sales, I believe. And I'm just curious with, Sanjay, maybe changing some of the priorities and things like that, is that still the -- without getting into the '18 plan that's not done yet, is that still the ballpark we should be thinking about long term? Great. Okay. And then the growth that you saw in your compute and networking, when you talk about quadrupling year-on-year in cloud, I guess that number surprised me a little bit. And how much of that do you think is sort of Micron improving penetration versus things like memory content going up, just help us understand how that number's so good year-on-year? Sanjay, my first question is, when you think about sort of the consensus view on long-term NAND demand, it's fairly bullish, which makes sense given the SSD story. But when you think about the long-term view of DRAM demand, I think it's less sanguine. And I think the view is sort of PC units aren't really growing, handset units probably not growing all that much. I'm just kind of curious, though, when you think about these new applications like data analytics, AI, maybe level 4, level 5 autonomous driving, is there a bottoms-up argument to have a more bullish long-term view on DRAM demand? And then I'd be kind of curious because the consensus is sort of 15% to 20% might be the long-term bit growth, which would be well below sort of the historic level. I'd love to get your view. And if it's greater than 15% to 20%, is that something that's going to require more than just technology transitions to support? That's helpful. And then, Ernie, as my follow-up, I know you don't want give us quarter-by-quarter mix targets, but I'm kind of curious, as you sort of exit the back half of this fiscal year where you're outgrowing industry bits in both NAND and DRAM, and you move into the first half of next year where you'll be undergrowing, can you help us just kind of frame, is there enough sort of mix up opportunity during the first half of '18 where even though you might be losing some bit share, you might not be losing sort of profit share in the industry? Or how do we think about where you are on that mix optimization curve? Two questions, Ernie and Sanjay. First, if you go from 20-nanometer to 18-nanometer in the case of DRAM and as well as 32- to 64-layer in case of 3D NAND, we just want to understand what kind of cost reduction should we be thinking about? And how is the trajectory as we look through calendar '18? And then I have a follow-up. Okay. That's very helpful. And finally, I just want to understand your thoughts on the DRAM channel inventory level at this point of time. I guess, first question, could you share your initial thoughts on what your outlook is for DRAM supply for the industry in calendar '18? And as part of that for 1x, when do you expect to reach a crossover point? That's helpful. And then, I guess, a quick follow-up on CapEx. You said you're going to spend towards the higher end of the range, so roughly $300 million plus, give or take a million. Is that more DRAM or NAND? Can you share where that spending is? And is that translating into more bits? Or does it relate to rising capital intensity?

For fiscal Q2 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $4.65 billion with non-GAAP gross margin of 38.5% and net income of $1.03 billion, or $0.90 per share. Revenue was at the top of our guidance while gross margin, operating income, and earnings per share exceeded projections. Operating cash flow was $1.8 billion. Last quarter, we provided detailed insight on industry pricing dynamics, explaining how the significant increases over trough pricing for PC DRAM far exceeded what we had seen in other segments, which typically react more slowly. This quarter, we saw continued gains in client DRAM pricing but also benefited from increases in mobile, cloud, and enterprise pricing as well. All of these segments showed meaningful quarter-over-quarter increases. These gains, combined with outstanding progress on cost reductions, led to a significant increase in our DRAM margins. In NAND, we were able to capitalize on an increasing percentage of low-cost 3D TLC NAND by more fully participating in the SSD market. As a result, while blended ASPs were down slightly due to a higher density product mix, our NAND margins improved substantially over last quarter. As we noted in our February analyst conference, we continue to see broad industry trends placing increasing value on the memory and storage technologies we develop and the features those product -- those technologies can provide. In the most recent quarter, you can see that reflected in significant increases in cloud and enterprise businesses, both in bits shipped and value of products going to those segments, and in an ongoing preference for SSDs over HDDs in storage platforms. We'll comment more on this when we walk through the specific business details in a moment. From a supply and demand perspective, we continue to be comfortable with market dynamics given the capacity plans we are aware of today. I'll now provide a high-level overview of each of the business units, and Ernie will follow on with more details on our financial performance. In the compute and networking business unit, we experienced continued revenue growth as a result of strength across all market segments with particular strength in cloud and enterprise. We began enablement of our 1X nanometer products and extended our lead in graphics technology with the announcement of our next generation GDDR5X product, which is the fastest discrete memory available. In our mobile business, as in other segments, broad market tightness has resulted in increased ASPs across all types of mobile memory. Our customers continue to be focused on increased memory and storage density for smartphones, which nicely plays to Micron strategy to focus on MCP markets. We plan to introduce more than 20 new MCP designs over the next 12 months to address the highest growth mobile applications. Customers prefer these solutions because they simplify design, validation and supply chain processes. MCPs also provide Micron with an opportunity to strengthen our relationship with key market enablers, providing a path to increased market share. Our embedded business grew revenues this quarter through increased DRAM shipments in automotive as well as consumer and connected home applications, and we achieved record automotive revenues for the fourth quarter in a row. Increased NAND shipments to industrial multi-market customers helped offset this quarter's anticipated decline in NOR shipments to Japanese gaming applications. Design and activity continues to be strong for our 20 nanometer DDR and LP DDR products in automotive, consumer, connected home, and Internet of Things gateway applications. In addition, design-in activity for our latest generation of automotive grade managed NAND continues to increase with new design wins up significantly over the prior quarter. Our storage business performance this quarter was driven by continued shift to cost-effective 3D NAND TLC products, and increased traction for our SSD portfolio across the OEM cloud and enterprise markets. Wins with OEM customers enabled a record number of SSD shipments during the quarter. Customer focus on larger capacity and tailored storage solutions led to a dramatic growth in our enterprise and cloud segments, which were our fastest-growing part of our SSD portfolio. The trend toward tailored solution drives greater opportunities for Micron to engage end customers on future IT investment planning. As we pursue these opportunities, our flexible, feature-oriented portfolio has been well received by our customers. The storage market has broadly adopted 3D TLC products, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of this trend. We are seeing the ongoing demand for high-performance, reliable, power efficient storage driving greater SSD adoption across multiple markets. We anticipate to grow our overall storage bit output as our Fab 10X expansion continues to ramp. Our technology transitions are on track, and will continue to provide benefit to the Company over the next several quarters. We are driving deployment of 1X DRAM with meaningful output expected by the end of the fiscal year. We expect 1X nanometer DRAM to build on our success with 20 nanometer DRAM, which is deployed throughout our portfolio and rated number one in quality by multiple enterprise OEM customers. Likewise, we are aggressively proliferating 32 layer 3D NAND through our product lines while also driving the deployment of 64 layer 3D NAND with meaningful output expected by the end of the fiscal year. Micron's unique integration of CMOS circuitry under the array will enable the industry's smallest die size on our 64 layer designs. As we look toward the end of our fiscal year, we are currently on track to have more than 75% of our NAND bits on 3D. Of course, certain segments require legacy NAND technologies and will transition much more slowly, embedded markets for example. As we previewed for you at our analyst day, we believe our NAND bit growth in fiscal 2018 will approximate the aggregate market growth. This will take 3D NAND to 90% of our total bit output for fiscal 2018. We continue to work on developing new memory technologies and are enabling our 3D XPoint technology. We will be shipping 3D XPoint memory for revenue later in 2017. We believe these innovative solutions offer unique value to enterprise customers and will be an important contributor to Micron's future success. Now, I'll turn it over to Ernie. Thank you Mark. The business environments in fiscal Q2 continued to be positive with our results favorably impacted by product mix, progress on our cost improvement, and the sustained positive pricing environment. I'll begin my remarks today with an overview of the fiscal Q2 results by technology and business unit followed by our corporate financial performance and guidance for fiscal Q3. DRAM represented 64% of our total revenue with the following segmentation: mobile was in the high 20% range; PC represented 25%; server also represented 25%, up from the high teens of the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, auto, and other embedded technologies, was in the low 20% range. In our nonvolatile memory business, trade NAND represented 30% of our revenue with the following segmentation: consumer, which includes memory cards, USB and components, represented approximately 40%; mobile represented 20%; and as a reminder, EMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-20% range, up from the mid-teens percent last quarter. And the automotive, industrial multi-market, and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range. Turning to performance by business unit, the compute and networking business units reported fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.92 billion, up 30% sequentially due to firm demand in a robust pricing environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $736 million, or 36% of revenue, up from 14% the prior quarter, enhanced by the pricing environment and better performance on costs. We saw good growth in the cloud and enterprise segments driven by shipments of our first generation 20 nanometer DDR4 products. Additionally, we are beginning shipments of our second generation product optimized for the industry's newest service -- server platform. Graphics saw modest revenue growth despite what is traditionally a seasonally weak period, and we began shipments of our next generation G5X to Nvidia for the new GeForce 1080Ti, further solidifying Micron's technology leadership in the high-performance graphics memory segment. Networking saw increased shipments and revenue driven by the continued growth of 20 nanometer 4 gigabit DDR3 and 8 gigabit DDR4 products at key OEMs, especially in Asia, and client revenue growth was primarily driven by the continued strong pricing environment. The mobile business unit delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.08 billion, up 5% sequentially, driven by a stronger pricing environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $170 million, or 16% of revenue, as pricing strength combined with improved costs. The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $590 million, up 2% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $193 million, or 33% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by increased automotive unit shipments and increased average selling prices of DDR3 and NAND on a like-for-like basis in our consumer and connected home segments. The storage business delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.04 billion, up 21% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $71 million, or 7% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by strong growth in client and cloud SSD shipments and lower costs. Our 5100 cloud drive, which was introduced in December, continues to be well received and is in the process of additional calls on a large number of customer platforms. Moving on to overall Company results, revenue for the fiscal second quarter was $4.65 billion, up 17% sequentially and driven primarily by DRAM pricing strength and increased NAND volume shipments in a stable to rising pricing environment. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 38.5%, up from 26% in the prior quarter, driven by product mix, cost reductions, and the strong pricing environment. Non-GAAP net income was $1.03 billion, or $0.90 per share. Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue increased 22% compared to the prior quarter as the result of a 1% increase in bit shipments and a 21% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the second quarter increased 16 percentage points sequentially to 44% driven primarily by the strong pricing environment and cost declines. As we look at the next couple of quarters, we expect that second-half fiscal year 2017 bits out will exceed first-half fiscal year 2017 bits out by about 10%. Our nonvolatile trade revenue, NAND revenue, increased 11% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting an 18% increase in bit shipments. ASPs were down 6% from the prior quarter on a blended basis, primarily as a result of a higher density product mix. Gross margin increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 31% as cost per bit was down 15%. We are seeing like-for-like price increases across nearly all segments and, looking forward, we expect that second-half fiscal year 2017 bits out will exceed first-half fiscal year 2017 bits out by about 30%, occurring primarily in FQ3. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $612 million, at the midpoint of the guidance range. The Company generated operating cash flow of $1.77 billion, representing an increase of $628 million over last quarter. To conform to GAAP reporting relative to the Inotera acquisition, we reflected approximately $350 million of the Inotera purchase price as a reduction to operating cash flows. As a result, our financial statements reflect operating cash flow of $1.41 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $4.6 billion. In the second fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.2 billion. Moving now to our guidance for the third quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: revenue in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion; gross margin in the range of 44% to 48%; operating expenses between $560 million and $610 million; operating income ranging between $1.8 billion and $2 billion; and EPS ranging between $1.43 and $1.57 per share based on 1.155 billion diluted shares. In closing, we remain focused on achieving the technology transition and cost reduction targets we outlined at our analyst day. Currently, we are tracking to deliver free cash flow in excess of the $1.5 billion we shared with you at that event and continue to view delevering as an important priority. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Thanks Ernie. In summary, we are heading into the third quarter with a strong market environment and steady progress on our technology initiatives. I'm preleased with our execution, and we continue to press forward together on technology, operational, and product enablement targets. Our continued progress towards these goals will enable us -- will enable further cost reductions and the opportunity to address higher value-added market segments. Looking to the market as a whole, we see increasing customer interest in Micron playing a more collaborative role in solving design challenges and plan to use this environment to strengthen our relationships with industry partners and customers. As you all know, at our analyst conference in February, I announced my retirement. While the board and I work to identify my successor, I remain fully committed and engaged in leading Micron through this exciting and dynamic period. We will provide further updates on our CEO search as appropriate. Operator, we are now ready to begin Q&A.","This is Mark. To date, we've seen no indication of that at all really in any segment. It's true that, in cycles, from time to time, that does happen late in a cycle, but, today, we see continued strong bit growth across almost every end market segment and no real indication of that occurring anywhere, in particular not in specialty, not in mobile, certainly not in the enterprise and server area. This is Mark. A year ago, Harlan, I can't catch that I even recall where we were on 3D NAND yields, but I will tell you we are very happy with where they are for 32 layer MLC and TLC. And again, TLC is the big piece of that. We are where we thought we ought to be and at very mature yields. 64 layer, as we talked about, is a material piece of our bid output late in the year, and we are very happy with the progress we are making there and the yields we are seeing on that technology as well. Sure. So relative to bit growth with NAND, that was more statement around what our output profile is going to look like. And of course, we will deploy that output to the end markets that we feel will provide the best opportunity for the Company here as we see the back half of the year unfold. Relative to automotive, it's very similar to what we've been consistently talking about -- driver assist systems, infotainment, a lot of what is required as we move up that autonomous driving food chain, and as what are today considered to be advanced features in automotive, the automotive business penetrates mid and lower end cars. So that -- there's nothing particularly unique about what continues to drive that. It's the same unfolding story relative to memory deployment in the automotive sector. I think, if the question is do we participate in all of the various pieces of automotive end demand, the answer is yes. We are in the drivetrain. We are in the ADAS systems. We are in the infotainment systems and continue to maintain strong market share in all those pieces. Yes. I think you're going to see them very broadly deployed. As we noted, the initial uptakes of that SSD was announced in the early part of December of last year. The uptake has been very strong, and we continue to see that growing at a significant rate here as we progress through the calendar year, along with some new features. We have a 5100 SATA drive with PCIE and NVMe coming soon as well, so we think that will help with the proliferation and the expansion of the demand. It's a good question. I think people are looking at the cycle and wondering are we getting long in the tooth, etc.? We start to read stuff about that. We are not seeing that at all. As mentioned, we are not seeing -- really what's driving this cycle when you think about it is broad-based demand across multiple market segments, and in particular it's content growth in all of those segments as opposed to particularly strong unit growth in one segment or the other. And so as we look at the market today, it looks very robust from an end market demand, and maybe much broader and less unit-driven than we've seen in the past. We also see that the supply, as best we can tell, seems in control relative to demand. And I think, if you think about this cycle versus last cycle, what you saw -- what you saw last cycle was a big chunk of supply come off with the Hynix fire and the reaction with more supply to replace it, and so maybe a little less stability than we're seeing this time around. So that's all on the DRAM side. On the NAND side, this HDD replacement cycle is big. We are well into it in client. It's not going to stop in the cloud and enterprise. Mobile storage demand continues to accelerate. And so, again, it's broad-based content growth in all of those end applications, and it's supply on the NAND side that's relatively capital-intensive to put in place with complex technology. And so there, again, that all seems like it's in pretty good shape. Again, I think the last cycle was a little different with that instability in supply created by the Hynix fire. I don't know why they would intentionally repeat the mistake from last cycle. They probably are enjoying making good margins. And our view is we just go out and we look at what information is available relative to all the various additions people are making and might be making and what the timeframe that might occur in, and then we give you -- you know, what we think that bit growth looks like. And that looks like it's probably actually -- Samsung is actually probably on the low end over the next couple of years relative to what's going on in the industry as a whole. And the industry as a whole is probably a little bit south of where we think demand growth is. So, could it happen? Yes. Why would it happen? I can't forecast that for you. This is Ernie. I think the important thing to bear in mind is, in the estimates that we've provided for supply growth this year of 15% to 20%, you would have to add some wafers to get into that range. Absent those wafer additions, you would be below the low end of that range, based on everything that we know. So, it is not a surprise that wafers are being added, given the forecast that we believe exists from the supply side. And again, the other thing to keep in mind here is there are some natural impediments. The technology is getting more expensive to deploy. It's getting more difficult. And as we look to the future, we do see trends towards new technologies that might come into place out in time, and that may be somewhat of an impediment to people as they think about do I really want to add incremental, significant new wafers to use supply when there may be competing technologies coming. This is Ernie. You and I have been around each other long enough to know you're not going to get an answer to your first question. We don't give underlying pricing assumptions to derive our gross margin guidance. Our gross margin guidance stands on its own for what it is. Relative -- can you repeat the second piece, half, of your question please? Yes. So, to do that would be predicting a pricing curve, which I also think is troublesome business. As we've talked about, right now, the pricing curve is much flatter than you typically see it, and the normal sort of rules of thumb as you look at segments continue to be a little bit inverted as we experience this environment that we are in. So, we have -- we never predict that things go up and to the right for an infinite period of time. You would expect that we would be thinking cautiously as we do our internal business planning, which we do. We do apply a very consistent methodology to how we look at things, but we aren't in a position to tell you when we think that the pricing curve would return to any sort of more normalized perspective that we would have from historical reference. I think we are pretty consistent with what we said at our analyst day. We talked about 50% to 75% of a $1.5 billion number. We are on track for that. We'll do that at a time and a pace of our choosing based upon a wide variety of business circumstances, but we do, as I said in my script, remain committed to this and think that it's an important priority for us. Certainly, that's the case today. And don't forget we've also talked in the past about how some of our other segments have contracts of longer duration, so you would get the impact of a renewal of those contracts and, generally speaking, that those renewal -- that renewal pricing environment would continue to be favorable as well. Sure. So, on the SSD side of the house, as we mentioned I think in response to an earlier question, we think we are at the early days of what we're seeing in terms of penetration on our cloud and enterprise SSDs. I think we do have fairly good momentum and traction in clients in OEM. So that is how we are looking at or thinking about what the opportunities are on the SSD side of the house. And then you also saw an increase in the percentage of the DRAM output that went into the server and cloud segment, and we see those continuing to increase here, or the demand side of it continuing to increase here, with all of the new data center deployments and a pretty strong demand environment for those. It's a transition primarily from planar to 3D. If it were 100% transition, which it's not, that ratio on a square footage basis might be something north of 2-to-1. But we have incremental space as well, so it's not exactly like that. From a 2D planar NAND, from a planar NAND wafer to a 64 layer 3D NAND wafer? It might be -- it's north of 300%, closer to 4X. Inotera has always been part of our output and measured in our bit shipments, so the transaction -- the formal closing of the transaction really did not represent an incremental addition to the Company's bit supply. We've all been able to read every week about what's happened to DRAM exchange with respect to spot pricing, and certainly that trend as influenced every single other segment. So I think, as Mark mentioned in his script, while last quarter the pricing was more focused around what was happening in the client and OEM markets, this quarter, the impact of that having extended over time and consistent with our earlier comments been subject to some of these contract renewals, are starting to manifest themselves across mobile, across enterprise, and really the full breadth of the DRAM product portfolio. I think, one, to reiterate something we said earlier, but it is very important, we are really consistent quarter to quarter with how we think about our guidance. So there was no dramatic change from a methodology point of view in that. And I think, John, you actually hit on many of the points that are contributing to that nice uptick in margin. So, first, we do have a broad profile, and that allows us to move between segments and really maximize the opportunity between those segments. And as you saw this quarter, we are tilting more to cloud and enterprise, which we think represents some good, long-term opportunity for the Company. We have system-level solutions that utilize the breadth of the Company's product portfolio in things like MCPs and builds on the capabilities of the Company with things like SSDs. You have a better technology execution, or strong technology execution, in terms of where we have been in the past, so the gap is closing. We've been consistently telling you that we think it will close and we're going to continue to make progress in that regard. And then you do have leverage that comes from the scale that we have achieved over the course of the last two or three years as we've made these technology transitions. So, really, I think, to the point you are making, this is not only about pricing. It's about pricing and everything else that we've been working on collectively as a team to deliver broad operational capability into all of our end markets. I don't want to put too much specificity around exactly where we will end up at the end of the year on a bit mix, but I will tell you that you will recall, at the analyst day, we shared with you that we believe we were making very good progress on our 1X nanometer yield ramp at that time, and that continues to go really very smoothly with a good progress in both Taiwan and Japan. So, we are very happy with the way it's going, and we will continue to monitor that and drive it appropriately. I will say also that there's a pretty good suite of products that penetrate a number of different end market segments, and those qualifications are going well and those products are looking very robust. And I'm happy with the way that's coming along. From a cost perspective, I think greater than 20% is what we've indicated in the past, and that's probably a good place to leave it for now. At the end of the day, it will depend on mix. We've got a lot of different products going in a lot of different segments. It's primarily around mix. We are shipping a lot of high density TLC 3D product versus, previously, we had some lower density products hanging out in some pretty small niches as our volume has gone up and as we've begun to drive more towards some of these higher density cloud type applications. We are doing more those types of products, and all of the pricing is down. They are driving some pretty significant cost improvements for us as well. And so, from a margin perspective, that's definitely where we want to be moving through time here. Consistent with sort of the ambitious plans we have around the SSD market, I would say the majority of that was attributable to that build-up. And in addition to that, if you are doing a quarter-on-quarter compare, Inotera on the DRAM side was not considered part of the inventory in the December quarter -- or sorry, in the prior quarter -- whereas it's currently part of our inventory. So that was really a significant part of the increase on the DRAM side. So, it's those two things. I think the best way I would guide you do there is we have actually provided what we thought was going to be a fiscal year -- a fiscal year cost-down target for both technologies and we've now given you all of the pieces that you need to compute that. So, that's how I would guide you to come up with your estimate of what you think our cost-downs are going to be. Sorry, the question around Chinese phones was content or -- We continue to see, in the lower-end and midtier phones, we continue to see pretty good content growth. Yes, there is more of a concern at the high end in terms of what eventually will people stop taking densities up there, but even at the high end, I think we anticipate some continued growth with 6 to 8 gigabits at the top. But in the lower-tier and mid-tier smartphones, we still see pretty robust growth, and so, in aggregate, when we look at mobile, we are thinking in terms of 30% bit growth there this year. It's very different segment to segment, customer to customer. So, I wouldn't say that there is a huge sea change, although clearly there are some customers in this kind of environment that are interested in lengthier relationships. Yes, we are not going to be too specific yet about our QLC plans, but we will confirm that we are happy with the way that technology is progressing. And that's probably all we've got to say for now. We are not going to give you gross margins, as Ernie already indicated unfortunately. We're just not going to go there. But relative to our competitive position on 3D NAND, we feel very good about it. I would direct you back to the comments we made in the slides we showed at the analyst conference a couple of months ago. We are very happy with our 32 layer yields. We are very happy with how we are progressing on our 64 layer spec. And we think we are in the lead position relative to our cost effectiveness and our density and our ability to deliver products at all the (inaudible). We really don't have an update for you. It's still, in our view, it's 15% to 20% supply growth this year, could actually be less than that if there's less new wafers than we have in our plan. Demand is still 20% plus. Next year, we would be in the teens if we don't get the new wafers. No, that was representative of what we think will ultimately be reflected in our financial statements. Again, the 30% was a function of our output, and we would direct that output into the various outlets that we have, whether it be the SSD business, the mobile business, etc. So, we will sort of wait and see how that plays out here as we get to the back half of the year. Again, I'd kind of refer you back to the full-year guidance that we provided, which was rather specific. We have now completed two quarters of that year, and we've given you a view of the back-half bit growth. So I think we've given you all the building blocks that you need to derive a gross margin profile, and that's not something that we typically share. And operator, I think we have time for one more question. I think the best way -- as best as we going to characterize wafers would be to say it's pretty stable. We are very focused on technology transitions. We are not focused on adding more supply, so we are just utilizing the existing capacity and transitioning it through advanced nodes. We do have white space in both our Fab 16 in Taichung as well as Fab 10X, but we are not planning any capacity additions this year. And if we were to decide we wanted to, which I think is unlikely, for us, as for our competitors, there is significant leadtime at the moment for equipment and it would take quite a while to bring that on in the marketplace. No, and, again, it's kind of moot. So, thanks for the questions. This is Ernie. Before we close, I wanted to share with everyone that Ivan is going to be transitioning out of his IR role into another role here at Micron, and I wanted to personally express my appreciation to him for his support of the Company during his tenure in IR, including bringing me up to speed, which was quite challenging, I'm sure. We will miss him very, very much. We are in the process of determining how best to fill his shoes, but in the interim, Liz Morali will be the primary IR contact point. And with that, we will say thanks again for your participation and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you everyone.","Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution and strong outlook. Despite the very optimistic and positive pricing environment, there's been some growing concern around the notion of demand destruction given the strong pricing environment and availability of both DRAM and NAND to a point where I think there is a view forming that there's potential for PC and server destocking on the DRAM side, less DRAM per box, on the mobile side, less DRAM per smartphone and on the NAND side, less uptake of SSDs and more uptake of HDDs. I guess the question is do you see this happening, and how does it impact the dynamics of the supply-demand environment going forward? Great, thank you for that. And then solid results in the NAND business with your margins up I think it's 800 basis points in the quarter. As we think about the cost curve on a go-forward basis and the ramp of your 64 layer 3D, can you just give us an idea on how your yields and performance of the products are doing either relative to your internal targets or relative to the same time last year in the ramp of your 32 layer products? Great. Thank you. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions from me. First of all, if you could talk a little bit more color around this -- I believe you talked about bit growth of about 30% half-over-half. Maybe qualify or quantify as much as you want to the growth drivers, how much from SSDs versus mobile, etc. And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the auto growth in the quarter and what's driving that and how that looks into the second half as well and what's the key contributors there? Thank you. Thanks very much for that. Just real quick on the first comments, on the -- just as it applies to cloud SSDs, your own cloud SSDs that you're launching, can you give a little more color on how broadly we should see those deployed maybe during the fall of this year? Great. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I guess, Mark, I'm just looking at the guidance, and you guys are guiding to a quarterly earnings number that's like 50% higher than you guys did in the last cycle, yet your stock is still $5.00 below where it peaked last time. And I know there are some changes in the cap structure and whatnot. But I guess the question really is what's the concern you hear from investors when you've been out there on the conference circuit this quarter? Are people worried about the sustainability of the cycle, and like what is the big concern from your point of you and is that valid? Okay. I guess just to follow onto that, so it looks like, based upon the guidance, that the gross margin in DRAM is going to be in excess of 50%. Usually, that doesn't last very long, and people are obviously worried about Samsung adding a bunch of wafers. Why would that not happen this time? Based upon what you know, why would that not happen? And sort of what's your -- obviously, they have to add some wafers. But what's your base assumption for what the competition will do sort of in terms of bit growth this year? Thanks. Agreed, guys. Thank you. I didn't know I went from Jewish to Italian. Anyway, congrats. It feels like we have stepped into a time machine and got off in 1995. Can you just go through your price assumptions for the gross margin guide, and then also maybe list the gross margin drivers in order of importance for beyond the May quarter? Sure, just list the gross margin drivers in order of importance for wait for beyond the make order? That's fine. Since I whiffed on my first question, maybe you'll allow me another follow-up. You talked about delevering now that cash flow is pretty good. Maybe give us any insight into what would be or what would trigger you to start raising capital or restructure the debt? What would be the options out there? Great. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the good results and thanks for taking the questions. The first question was a follow-up on just the broader pricing environment. I'm not looking for any absolute number, but just hoping you could help us understand if the contract prices that Micron has seen are still below spot prices. Obviously spot prices rallied pretty significantly, but there's some time maybe before contract can catch up. And just, with what you're guiding at, do you think contract pricing is still below spot in your assumptions? That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question, I know the Company talked a bit in the prepared remarks about certain mix shifts that it has been executing on, doing more in areas like SSDs, and moving more towards server DRAM and creation. I was hoping you could help us understand how much more you think you can achieve in those areas through the rest of this fiscal year. Thank you. Good afternoon. You mentioned that you 3D mix would exceed 75% by year-end in NAND. Could you remind me? Are you decommissioning 2D capacity, or is that 3D capacity all incremental? And what kind of longer-term ratio should we expect between 3D and 2D beyond this year? Okay. And then could you also remind me, as you transition from 2D to 3D, for the same wafer capacity, what type of bit growth do you get with 64 layer? Correct, yes. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question -- two questions. First, in terms of the DRAM bit supply, given that you have had Inotera under your belt, I'm curious why your bit shipments were only in the low single digits. And then I have follow-up. Okay, fair enough. Then on the pricing environment for DRAM, what contributed to the 21% increase? Was there any specific subsegment of DRAM that you saw strength? And do you think that this is a one-time event, or how should we think about it? I know you would not give more clarity on pricing going forward, but any color specifically on the 21% increase would be helpful. Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congratulations Mark and Ernie. Ernie, I know you're not going to talk about kind of forward pricing assumptions in the May guide, but when you look at the May guide and just how significantly above investor expectations it were, I was wondering if you could help us quantify or qualify a little bit to what extent is this being driven by cyclical leverage, like-for-like pricing, versus things that might have a little bit more longevity like your ability to mix into better end markets or your ability to cost-down or just operational efficiencies. And as you answer the question, I'd be curious just to see your view on whether or not you believe you are starting to close that cost cap with some of your peers out there. That's helpful. Then maybe as my follow-up, Mark, in your prepared comments, you talked about having meaningful 1X volume by the end of this fiscal year. I'm wondering if you could quantify what you mean by meaningful. And I guess, from my perspective, it seems like a little bit earlier than I would have expected. Is that true? And if so, are you just finding it an easier ramp? And can you remind us of sort of the cost-downs you expect to get with the move to 1X? Great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Thank you. I'm wondering if you could touch on the NAND prices being down sequentially. I was little surprised to see that relative to what we are hearing. Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then your inventory picked up a little bit, and I was surprised to see that because I know how much customers want product. Can you just talk about, that and did that sort of -- is that the ramp in NAND or what are we seeing there? Makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much. This is Kristen [Shak] in for Romit Shah. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the great quarter, guys. My first question, you gave some helpful commentary about the bit growth for the second half of fiscal 2017 versus the first half of fiscal 2017. I was just wondering if you could give some color about how we should think about the cost declines for the second half versus the first half. I'm not looking for anything, really concrete numbers, just anything qualitative would be great. Okay, great. Thanks. And then we are still seeing a lot of the spec-ing uptrends for Chinese smartphones, especially in DRAM. With the strong pricing that we've seen in DRAM over the past few months, do you see that trend changing, or do you see that trend continuing? Any color there would be great. Yes, content, mainly in DRAM content. Great. Thanks guys. Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Just two if I can. Just how can we think about contract discussions with customers? Are you seeing more long-term type of duration negotiations? And I just had a quick follow-up. Thanks. Great. And for 3D NAND, any update on timing of QLC introduction, and would you introduce it at the 64 layer density? Thanks. Thanks so much. Thank you for taking my question. Just two quick questions on behalf of Raji Gill. You spoke a little bit towards the yields with 3D NAND on the 32 layer. Could you just talk a little bit about your competitive advantage going forward on the 3D NAND side, and then also just give a little bit more color on your gross margin trajectory and how we should think about that throughout the year? Thank you. Okay, great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Can you guys -- first question -- update us on your thoughts in terms of DRAM supply demand for this year? And are we to assume that tightening shortages should continue through the calendar year? And then assuming the wafers that you already have baked into that 15% to 20% supply, if we don't see new wafers next year and we just think about a world that shrinks, how should we think about supply into calendar 2018? Great. And as a follow-up, you talked about second-half DRAM bits being 10% higher than first-half. I'm assuming that's production. Can you hit that on a sales basis, or should we assume slightly less, given the timing of 1X? Excellent. Thanks so much. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question on, first of all, for the NAND flash business with mobile being only 20% of the sales there. I was wondering. Just given the relatively low exposure there currently relative to the overall market, is that implying that, for the second half of the year, you are expecting you'll see a lot of seasonality that's helping to drive some of the second-half 30% half-on-half growth? Okay, that's fair. As my follow-up, in terms of the gross margin guidance, can you talk a bit about the implied cost reductions on both DRAM and NAND flash for this quarter's guidance? Just given the relatively high output for your 20 nanometer DRAM and also I guess the ramping nature of 32 layer 3D, is there still a lot of cost reduction in the current quarter from both of those technologies? Hi. Thanks. Congrats on great results. I have a question around your supply growth, given there is such strong pricing out there in the market. So, firstly, can you talk about what the underlying wafer capacity trend is doing for Micron in both DRAM and NAND this year? And related to that, how much flexibility, given how strong pricing is today, how much flexibility does Micron have to add more either this calendar year or next year? I'm not saying that you will. Just how much flexibility do you have to add more if, for whatever economic means reasons, you could make the calculation that it does make sense to add more? Thanks. Is it possible to quantify how much it would be in terms of wafers? Again, not saying you're going to add it, but just how much capacity you have the ability -- and how much do you have the ability to add in both DRAM and NAND? Thanks very much.

Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter results accentuate an unprecedented year for the company. I thank the Micron global team for maintaining intense focus on our key priorities and delivering outstanding results. Our fourth quarter revenue was $6.14 billion with record gross margin, operating income and free cash flow. Full year revenue, profitability and free cash flow also set company records. Our results were driven by favorable industry fundamentals and solid execution in deploying our next-generation, lower-cost technologies and diversifying our product portfolio toward a richer mix of differentiated, high-value solutions. We are excited about future opportunities as customers increasingly recognize the strategic value of our memory and storage solutions across a range of high growth markets. Now I will share details from each of our business units, followed by our perspectives on industry dynamics and an outline of our corporate strategy. In our Compute and Networking Business Unit, we saw robust growth in Q4 revenue and profitability compared with the prior year. Our results were driven by strong demand in cloud and graphics, complemented by a healthy pricing environment. Revenue growth from these 2 segments significantly exceeded overall CNBU growth, which more than doubled compared with the year-ago quarter. Cloud sales are supported by increasing DRAM content per server, which is up nearly 50% versus a year ago. In graphics, we continue to leverage our industry-leading GDDR5 and GDDR5X performance to address strong demand, primarily from gaming. The business unit is also benefiting from the initial ramp of our first-generation 1X 8-gigabit DDR4 product, which was sold primarily into the client and cloud segments. In fiscal Q1, we anticipate continued growth of our 1X portfolio, coincident with the ramp of our second-generation 1X 8-gigabit DDR4 and GDDR5 products, both of which have already been validated at certain partners and customers. We also received initial customer qualifications on our TSV-stacked DDR4 products, enabling modules with up to 128 gigabyte and the highest speed supported on industry-standard server platforms. These products address the growing demand for analytics and in-memory database sales in both the enterprise and cloud segments. Fourth quarter revenues in our Mobile Business Unit were driven by a favorable pricing environment and significant growth in our eMCP business. Due to strong execution, sales from our mobile NAND and eMCP solutions nearly doubled year-over-year. We believe that increased DRAM and flash capacities in flagship smartphones will continue, due in part to new applications such as augmented reality in mobile devices. Our roadmap of new LPDRAM, discrete managed NAND and eMCP offerings position us well to address these market requirements. In fiscal Q4, we achieved our first 1X LPDRAM qualification at a major mobile OEM and have several others underway. Also, our technology capabilities in 1X LPDRAM package-on-package products allow us to offer cost-effective, high-capacity mobile solutions ranging from 3 gigabytes to 8 gigabytes. We expect volume shipments of these new products in fiscal 2018, following successful customer qualifications. During the fourth quarter, we also qualified our first 3D TLC eMCP and eMMC solutions at a major chipset vendor and now have dozens of high-density products in qualification with several OEMs. We expect production shipments to start later in 2017. Our 64-layer 3D TLC UFS products will also start OEM qualifications later in 2017, enabling us to participate in the mobile market's highest-density designs. The Storage Business Unit recorded a revenue increase of 71% in Q4 compared with the prior year quarter, supported by a strong demand for our SSD product portfolio. Late in the fourth quarter, we identified and corrected a flash component issue on select TLC 3D NAND products. We paused shipments of affected products, and we worked to implement a solution to the issue, which appeared only under a narrow set of performance conditions. As a result, our SSD revenue declined sequentially during the quarter. Shipments have now restarted, and we expect to resume solid, sequential SSD revenue growth in Q1. We continued to garner positive momentum with our SSD products across a broad range of customers. Our flagship SATA 5100 SSD has been qualified at enterprise server OEMs, cloud service providers and Fortune 500 companies. Demand for our client SSDs is also strong with Micron shipping solutions to most leading PC OEMs. We see healthy demand trends for SSDs moving forward. Client SSD attach rates continue to increase. And although storage density growth has slowed temporarily due to a tight pricing environment, we foresee longer-term demands for higher-density SSDs. We made substantial progress in growing our relationships and our business with cloud and hyperscale customers in fiscal 2017. Cloud data center customers are seeking innovative memory and storage solutions tailored to their workloads. Micron's unique capabilities and expertise in DRAM, 3D NAND and emerging memory technologies make us a compelling partner for these customers. Our Embedded Business Unit delivered strong performance, growing revenue 39% for the full year. We strengthened our leadership position in automotive in fiscal 2017, with growth driven by increasing connectivity and electronics content in vehicles. Automotive applications continue to require leading-edge performance. As a result, we have seen significant ramp of our 20-nanometer DDR and LPDDR technologies this quarter and began sampling automotive-grade 1X DRAM to meet these needs. The growth in edge analytics in both industrial and consumer/connected home applications led to record quarterly revenues in both segments. We saw strong growth through the year of our NAND and LPDDR MCP products, driven by form factor and performance needs in applications like machine-to-machine communications, surveillance, drones and home automation. Turning to Micron's technology progress, our 1X DRAM and our 64-layer NAND production rollout is proceeding on plan, and we expect to achieve mature yields in both technologies before the end of calendar 2017. We are pleased with our 1Y DRAM technology progress and are focused on the late stages of technology and product development. Our third-generation 3D NAND development is also proceeding well, with production expected to commence later in 2018. This latest-generation technology continues to utilize Micron's industry-leading CMOS Under the Array architecture, which yields smaller die sizes. We have made significant progress in our technology development and volume ramp execution. We see meaningful opportunities to further shorten the cadence of new technology node introductions, accelerate new technologies into volume production, upgrade our fab infrastructure and expand our captive assembly operations. Through successful execution, we expect to narrow our technology cost gap and optimize bit output growth in both DRAM and NAND with a disciplined focus on profitable growth. Our fiscal year 2018 CapEx plan targets achieving these objectives through technology migrations with no new wafer capacity. Ernie will discuss our CapEx plans in further detail later in the call. Our ability to successfully execute our technology transition plans will be a key enabler of our cost reduction and supply bit growth capability in the foreseeable future. Moving on to the demand and supply fundamentals, we expect the industry to remain moderately undersupplied for the rest of 2017 for both DRAM and NAND. We see DRAM industry supply bit growth of about 20% in calendar 2017 and expect it to grow at relatively similar levels in calendar 2018. The DRAM industry supply and demand balance is expected to stay healthy throughout calendar 2018, driven in part by ongoing strength in data center and cloud computing trends. We expect Micron's fiscal 2018 DRAM bit output growth to be slightly below the industry growth rate. Our bit growth is supported by our 1X DRAM ramp, which represented mid-teens percent of our DRAM bit output in Q4 and will grow throughout the next several quarters to achieve bit output crossover as we exit calendar year 2018. We expect industry NAND bit supply growth to finish calendar 2017 in the high-30% range. At these levels, supply remains below demand, which has created a constrained environment. As the industry continues to transition to 64-layer 3D NAND, we estimate industry bit supply growth in calendar 2018 will approach the 50% range, which should better satisfy the current unfulfilled demand. We expect that Micron's ongoing transition to 64-layer 3D NAND in fiscal 2018 will result in bit output growth that is somewhat higher than the industry range. In fiscal Q4, 64-layer NAND represented mid-teens percent of our trade NAND bit output, and we expect to achieve bit output crossover during the second half of our fiscal 2018. The dynamic industry transition to 3D NAND is taking place in the context of a NAND market that has consistently exhibited demand elasticity. We expect this behavior to continue for the foreseeable future as higher-density SSD solutions increasingly displace HDDs in client computing, cloud data centers and enterprise environments and as average capacities continue to grow with more performance-sensitive, storage-hungry devices and applications in mobile and other end markets. These trends support our view that NAND demand drivers will remain healthy into 2018. As I begin my first new fiscal year here as CEO, I would like to outline our strategic priorities. First, we are focused on driving our cost competitiveness to best-in-class levels primarily by accelerating the percentage of our output on leading-edge technology in both DRAM and NAND. Second, we will drive execution excellence, delivering solutions to customers quickly, predictably and in line with their product launch windows. Third, we will accelerate our transition to high-value solutions. We intend to lead the industry in deploying disruptive memory and storage solutions. Fourth, we will leverage the full breadth of our capabilities to develop deeper collaboration and partnerships with marquee customers, maximizing our value in the market. And finally, we are strengthening our focus on our teams, investing in the best talent and driving a winning culture. We believe our diligent emphasis on the speed and urgency with which we execute these strategic priorities will have a transformative effect on our market competitiveness and financial performance. I look forward to sharing the results of our progress with you in the year ahead. I'll now turn it over to Ernie who will walk through the specifics of our financial performance this quarter. Thank you, Sanjay, and thanks for joining the call today. Our solid operational execution and favorable market dynamics resulted in excellent financial performance in our fourth fiscal quarter and the full year. For the full fiscal year, we achieved record revenue of $20.3 billion, up 64% from the prior year. We narrowed the technology cost gap with our competitors by successfully executing our technology migration plans. Our efforts resulted in strong levels of DRAM and NAND bit output growth for fiscal year 2017, enhancing our competitiveness while maintaining our wafer output. I'll now provide some further details on Q4 results, starting with the breakdown by technology and business unit. DRAM represented 66% of our Q4 revenue with the following segmentation: server held steady at approximately 30%; mobile was 20%; specialty DRAM, which includes networking, graphics, automotive and other embedded technologies, remained in the mid-20% range; and PC was also in the mid-20% range. Our trade NAND revenue represented 30% of total revenue. The 3 segments comprised of SSDs; mobile, which includes managed NAND discrete solutions and MCPs; and automotive, industrial and other embedded applications, each represented approximately 20% of our quarterly trade NAND revenue. The remaining 40% of our trade NAND was made up primarily of component sales to partners and customers. Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit reported record FQ4 revenue of $2.8 billion, more than doubling on a year-over-year basis. The growth was supported by strong demand from cloud customers who are architecting data centers and computing capabilities that enable them to execute their specific strategies. Our successful conversion to 20-nanometer DRAM production and the initial ramp of 1X DRAM output boosted Q4 CNBU operating income to $1.6 billion or 56% of revenue, up 31% compared with Q3. The Mobile Business Unit delivered its highest-ever revenue quarter at $1.2 billion, up 76% from the year-ago quarter. Mobile operating income also set a record at $364 million or 31% of revenue. Our results are due in part to the positive progress we've made in qualifying our mobile NAND solutions, and we expect this momentum to continue in fiscal '18. The Storage Business Unit reported fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.3 billion, up 71% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue and operating income were slightly lower quarter-over-quarter due to the NAND component issue that Sanjay discussed earlier. With this issue behind us, we are focused on leveraging the progress we've made in penetrating the SSD markets over the past year. We estimate that our global SSD market share nearly doubled in fiscal 2017, enabling record fiscal year revenue for the Storage Business Unit. Our operating income for the first -- fourth quarter was $250 million or 19% of revenue compared with a loss of $57 million in the same period last year. The Embedded Business Unit also achieved record performance in fiscal Q4 with revenue of $827 million, up 18% sequentially and 61% on a year-over-year basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by solid sales for consumer applications, which include home automation. Automotive also remains a key revenue driver for this business as the shift towards smarter and connected cars is driving increased memory content. These trends bode well for Micron as we continue to capture new design wins and strengthen our leadership position. Operating income for EBU was $348 million in Q4 or 42% of revenue, more than doubling year-over-year. Moving on to overall company results. Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $6.1 billion, up 10% from last quarter and 91% on a year-over-year basis. Sales of server and SSD solutions each were more than 3x higher than year-ago levels, reflecting our focus toward a higher value-add revenue mix. Non-GAAP gross margin was 51%, up 3 percentage points from Q3 and 33 points from the fourth quarter of fiscal '16. The improvement reflects the successful adoption of products based on our advanced technologies combined with a healthy industry pricing environment. Non-GAAP net income was $2.4 billion or $2.02 per share. For the full fiscal year, we achieved non-GAAP net income of $5.6 billion or $4.96 per share compared with $273 million or $0.26 per share for fiscal 2016. Turning to results by product line. DRAM revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis and increased 13% sequentially. The sequential results reflect a 5% increase in bit shipments. DRAM non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 59%, up 39 percentage points from year-ago levels and up 5 points sequentially, benefiting from an 8% increase in ASPs. We are seeing the benefits of execution on our technology migration plans and the continued strong market environment. Trade NAND revenue increased 81% on a year-over-year basis. Sales were 8% higher quarter-over-quarter, supported by demand from mobile and embedded segments and a 5% increase in ASPs. Trade NAND's non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 40%, up 24 percentage points from a year ago and down 1 percentage point sequentially as a result of the NAND-related issues mentioned earlier. NAND bit shipments increased sequentially by 3% during the quarter. Our fiscal year results reflect strong adoption of our 3D TLC NAND products and a strong market environment. As we continue -- as we consider the ongoing progress of the business as well as the competitive environment, we plan on making a few changes to our disclosures beginning with F Q1 2018. Specifically, we will be eliminating the presentation of changes in cost per bit and market segmentation detail for each technology. The evolution of our business to higher value-add solutions, which often have higher BOM costs and higher margin opportunities, makes cost per bit comparison a less reliable indicator of our progress. Relative to the market segmentation by technology, we will continue to provide qualitative color through our business unit reporting. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $601 million, essentially flat from the prior quarter. The company generated operating cash flow of $3.2 billion in fiscal Q4 compared to $896 million in the year-ago period. During the quarter, we deployed $1.5 billion for capital expenditures net of partner contributions and $5.1 billion for the full fiscal year. DRAM investments were between 40% and 45% of the full year spend, and nonvolatile memory was around 30%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion and, for the full year, was $3.3 billion compared to negative $2.7 billion in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we deployed $1.6 billion or approximately 50% of our free cash flow for de-levering activities. The results of these activities represent approximately $0.07 of annualized EPS accretion. We ended the fourth quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $6.2 billion. Turning to more near-term matters as we have been discussing for some time, our 2 key priorities for cash flow are accelerating the company's cost competitiveness and improving our financial foundation through reducing leverage. Our fiscal 2018 plan enables both priorities. We currently expect our fiscal 2018 CapEx net of partner contributions to be in the range of $7.5 billion, plus or minus 5%. Our investments will be focused on technology transition and product enablement. Generally, we expect that between 35% and 45% of CapEx will be deployed for DRAM, 35% to 45% for nonvolatile memory and the remainder for technology and product enablement. There are no wafer capacity additions planned for fiscal 2018. We will continue to target our free cash flow generation for the opportunistic retirement of debt. We see the opportunity to reach our interim target of $8 billion to $9 billion of gross debt during fiscal 2018. These actions, together with the progress that we've made in fiscal 2017, would drive annualized EPS improvement of between $0.18 and $0.23. We also see the potential to be net cash positive as we exit fiscal 2018. Moving on to guidance for fiscal Q1 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: revenue in the range of $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion; gross margin in the range of 50% to 54%; operating expenses between $575 million and $625 million; operating income ranging between $2.65 billion and $2.85 billion; and EPS ranging between $2.09 and $2.23 per share based on 1,191,000,000 diluted shares. With that, I'll turn it back to Sanjay. Thank you, Ernie. As part of our strategic planning process, Micron developed a new vision statement that embodies how we see the opportunities in front of us. As we close out one year and look to the next, I would like to now share it with you. Our vision- Transforming how the world uses information to enrich life - captures the tremendous potential Micron possesses. New technologies like artificial intelligence will change the world in ways we can barely imagine today. Fast data access and high-performance data analytics will be at the heart of those transformations, making memory and storage core to the data-centric world that is taking shape in front of our eyes. I believe our strategy to tighten our focus, accelerate our technology and product development and strengthen our presence in critical markets will make Micron an increasingly prominent player in the industry as these revolutionary new technologies take shape. Fiscal 2017 was a record year for us, but I'm confident that the best is yet to come for Micron. We will now open for questions.","Yes, so multipart question. Let me try and break it down in an easily understandable way. First, as you pointed out, there is a time lag between the time CapEx is invested and the time that the bit growth is realized. And certainly, if you look at what we did in 2017, that was actually a function of the investments that we made in 2016. And it's also important to remember that the bit growth that we were able to realize from the Inotera investments were not part of Micron's CapEx plan then. So if you add Micron's spend and Inotera's spend, you're probably in the upper $6 billion range. And so that's a good point of comparison as we now look at 2018. So in 2018, we would expect the majority of the bits that are the results of the CapEx to come on towards the latter part of the fiscal year. And you heard Sanjay in his prepared remarks say that we would be at bit crossover on an output basis for our 64-layer NAND around the second or third fiscal quarter of the year. But it was going to be the exit part of the calendar year for DRAM before we hit bit output crossover on 1X. So that gives you some sense of the timing and the impacts of timing on those investments. I would also tell you that our objective over a multiyear period is to grow at about industry levels. And certainly, we think this investment plan, over the course of a multi year horizon, will allow us to do that, obviously being above in 2017 fiscal, as we've just reported, DRAM at the low end, a little above on NAND. So I think looking at snapshot comparisons across our fiscal year is interesting, but really important is the statement that we intend to grow, aligned with industry over the course of these multiyear periods. And I think that's probably the best broad perspective I can provide. Happy to address any specific question. And of course, our focus also would be on high-value solutions so that our revenue share outperforms our bit share. In terms of the market environment, we are certainly excited about the demand requirements for DRAM as well as for NAND. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, a big growth driver for DRAM certainly that's outpacing the average growth of the industry is in the area of server and cloud. And here, we are making great penetration with the hyperscale customers in terms of driving the growth of their DRAM business. So we remain very bullish about the DRAM market environment. Through the 2017, we think it will be undersupplied. And given the demand trends, we think we'll have healthy demand-supply balance in DRAM throughout 2018 time frame as well. And in terms of NAND, it is well known that average capacities are increasing certainly in mobile devices, but even more importantly, SSDs are displacing HDDs at a rapid pace, with attach rate continuing to be projected to be going up over the course of next several quarters. And of course, there is a strong value proposition for SSDs in the cloud and hyperscale data center environment as well, given all the trends of artificial intelligence, machine learning, all of this is driving big data analytics. So all these trends related to artificial intelligence, big growth in data, customers wanting to offer differentiated value to their end customers. All of this is driving need for memory and storage solutions. And overall, we remain pretty bullish about the demand trends. I mean, if you look at DRAM as well as NAND, even in autonomous vehicles, the demand requirements for flash, I mean, data is being generated -- so much data is being generated by autonomous vehicles that it requires fast processing both within the vehicle as well as on the cloud. So I think demand trends for the foreseeable future continue to be strong, and that bodes well for our industry. In terms of your question regarding customers and some of the customers wanting to engage in longer-term requirements, yes, that is absolutely happening, and we do consider that based on various customers. I mean, it depends on the nature of the customer's requirements. We cannot get into the details of that here in this call. But certainly, our business includes customers that are more transactional in nature, that have business more on a monthly transaction basis, some that are more on a quarterly basis, and certainly, certain customers that are also involved in longer-term trends. I think customers are just seeing the increasing value of memory and storage. I mean, this -- DRAM and flash is becoming strategic to our customers. And our customers are seeing Micron as being uniquely positioned with having a strong portfolio of DRAM as well as flash and being the only company in the western hemisphere with those capabilities. And that is definitely making us an attractive and valued partner to our customers. So in terms of going into 2018, we see healthy industry demand and supply balance for NAND. And you are right to note that the bit growth is going up because of the technology transition in the industry to the 64-layer technology. And when we look at the demand trends, those demand trends continue to be strong, as I just pointed out, related to SSDs as well as increasing average capacities of flash in mobile devices and all kinds of other devices. So demand continues to be strong. We see healthy trends in that regard in 2018 time frame. Regarding pricing, we don't specifically, for competitive reasons, provide comments on pricing on the call. But we'd just like to point out that we believe that the healthy industry environment is one where price decline is less than or equal to cost decline. And we are certainly focused on aggressively reducing our product costs with -- and realizing successfully our technology production ramp of 64-layer. Certainly, the diversification of the end markets for DRAM absolutely bodes well for the future health of our business. We are enjoying the benefits of that. Calendar year 2017, as you noted, is a great example. And you just pointed out the mix of our DRAM business between PC. What used to be just about PC and mobile is now very much about PC, mobile, server, automotive in multitude of markets. And Micron has really great presence with variety of -- I mean, whole slew of customers and channels. So this really bodes well, plays very well to the strength of Micron. It has really, for a long time, enjoyed a diversified set of global customers and great presence in channels. And that is coming into full play as the demand requirements for DRAM continue to grow nicely and into 2 multiple mega-markets. With respect to NAND, in terms of our third-generation 3D NAND, we are not yet disclosing the number of layers in that technology. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are continuing to make good progress with that, and we plan to be introducing that technology in the 2018 -- calendar 2018 time frame and continuing to deploy CMOS Under the Array technology that continues to provide Micron a die-size leadership position, which is usually attractive cost point of view. And with respect to DRAM in terms of 1Y node, we will be introducing that node also in calendar 2018 time frame. And beyond that, we are not providing any specific details for our technology related to competitive basis. And your question regarding floating gate, we have a strong road map of future technologies related to floating gate. As we have indicated before that in terms of technology cost position as well as the technology node readiness, in recent times over the course of last couple of years, Micron has lagged the competitors in terms of getting advanced technology ready and at par with them and deploying those technologies into volume production. However, in recent times, Micron has made very good progress in this area, and we are getting the benefit of that as we are ramping those technologies into production. I have said before that these kind of undertakings, driving accelerated deployment of new technology nodes into volume production and continuing to narrow the gap on the cost front is a multiyear phenomenon, and we have made very good progress in this regard. I fully expect us to make -- continue to make good progress in fiscal year 2018 as well. And we will -- we are, of course, very much focused on continuing to accelerate the time line of our future technologies into production and then well positioned to ramp those technologies into volume production as well. And along with this, of course, remain very much focused on driving a greater mix of high-value solutions both in DRAM and NAND as well. So these are really 2 very important pillars of our strategy: driving cost competitiveness and driving greater mix of high-value solutions. And these things don't happen overnight. They will continue to be strong growth opportunities for us going forward over the course of the next few years. So I will let Ernie comment on the CapEx. But on the demand side, as I pointed out earlier, I mean, it's not that this demand is perishable. I mean, this demand -- in terms of the trend of SSDs replacing HDDs in clients' notebook computers where their attach rate continues to increase in 2017, attach rate of SSDs to PCs is around 35%. That attach rate, over the course of next few years, continues to grow to around 50% in 2018 and, by 2020 time frame, expected to grow to around 75%. So these demand trends are secular in nature. It's the same thing on the enterprise side and on the cloud side that attach rates of SSDs as well as the average capacity requirement on a per-server basis continue to go up as well. So these are really very solid secular trends here that are long term in nature. And of course, the trends of mobile devices adding new rich features such as augmented realities, such as rich displays, all of these are trends that also continue to drive higher average capacities in mobile devices. So I feel very good about the demand trends on the NAND side. Yes, and just to follow up on the CapEx. If you look year-on-year, we just reported the totality of fiscal '17, and you would get a reasonably similar number within the ranges we provided. So there, we would expect on a hard dollar basis perhaps $100 million to $200 million more in that enablement and technology piece of the business. And that's predominantly related to the centers of excellence that we've been talking about relative to wanting to consolidate a lot of our back-end operations very close to our front-end operations. Some of the product enablement CapEx is related to back-end captive assembly operations, which will help us improve our cost position going forward. And of course, also, there is CapEx associated with upgrading of the infrastructure that is needed to realize the technology transitions. Sure, Chris. So I think as has been the case for a few quarters now, there's actually a fair amount of tightness across that -- across those 3 channels that you mentioned. So it would be hard to distinguish one from the other relative to any nuances there. I don't think there's an inventory issue. Certainly, if you actually take a look at inventory levels that are reported, which are typically financial numbers, and adjust those for dollar costs of how pricing has changed over the course of the year, you do get a bit of a different perspective on inventory, as reported by a variety of customers and channel partners in those areas, but the environment continues to be strong. The supply-demand circumstances continue to be fairly tight, and we're working very closely with our customers to make sure that we stay in close sync with them as they think about their plans going forward. We do not rule out M&A in the future. Right now, our focus is on the priorities that I mentioned that include cost competitiveness and strengthening the high value mix in our revenue. And of course, if and when we were to engage in M&A, our focus would, of course, be to try to strengthen our future opportunity and make it an opportunity that absolutely provides a strong ROI. Beyond that, I will not speculate in this matter. I don't think the experience that, I think, you're referring to, colors our perspective on partnerships, at all partnerships are very individualized, partner-specific set of activities. And so certainly, while we continue to become informed just as you do, our color would be very specific to the circumstances at hand vis-a-vis any potential partnerships or the continuation of any partnerships. And I think we have a long history of valued partnerships here and knowing how to make the partnerships work well. So I mean, partnerships are important. Absolutely. I mean, we are definitely seeing strong demand trends from the entire spectrum of our customers. Large, what you would call Tier 1 or Tier 2, as you term, although all customers are important to us, and we do engage meaningfully with them and we work closely with them to understand their demand requirements. And we apply our own judgment to their demand requirements as well in terms of assessing the overall industry demand trends. And based on those demand understanding of our -- on behalf of our customers, we project healthy industry demand-supply environment in DRAM and NAND. Sure. So we talked about being at bit output crossover for 1X DRAM by -- before the end of calendar year 2018. And then as we have previously shared for the 1X node, we see somewhere roughly 45% increase in bits per wafer versus 20-nanometer and about a 20 -- to slightly more than 20% cost reduction on a cost per bit basis. So we said that our SSD makes up about 20% of our NAND revenue, and that consists of our sales of client -- to client customers as well as to the hyperscale cloud and enterprise customers. And both are roughly about the same in both of those categories. Beyond that, we don't provide further breakdown. Sure. So I think that in terms of gen 3 NAND, we'll certainly talk more about that as we are able to in terms of what we might expect and whatever is appropriate for that. So it is true, just on a mathematical basis, that as you progress up layer count on an absolute basis, there are less incremental bits, and there is an association between cost reduction and bit growth opportunity. But in terms of providing specifics, it's very, very early to share that with you. And if you look at 64-layer versus the first generation, it's somewhere in the realm, as we've talked about before, of 2x the density and roughly in aggregate of 30% reduction in bit cost. In general, the technology complexity increases with subsequent technology generations both in DRAM and NAND. And also given the increased technology complexity, gigabytes or gigabits that you gained in NAND as well as DRAM on a per-wafer basis tends to decline with advanced technology nodes. So all of those factors play a role in terms of cost reduction capabilities as well going forward. Sure, I can do that. And I just want to add a comment to the previous question on cost. My comment was related to cost on a per wafer -- gigabytes-per-wafer basis from one technology node to the next. Of course, cost also depends very much on how you deploy those technologies into volume production, and this is one of our focus areas in terms of deploying advanced technologies faster into production. Now specific to your second question regarding the attach rates in enterprise and server markets, so SSD attach rate is around 50% there in terms of -- on an SSD per-unit basis. And opportunity, there is greater. Average capacities are definitely moving fairly fast. In fact, enterprise and data center is one of the fastest-growth segments for flash in terms of year-over-year bit demand increases that are projected. Average capacities in enterprise and data center for SSDs are over 3 terabytes. That's the average capacity, and that trend continues to increase by some projections, tripling almost to 9 terabytes by 2020 time frame. So as I was saying earlier, I mean, these demand trends for increasing attach rate of SSDs in client and data center cloud computing applications as well as increases in average capacity are secular trends. Yes, Mark. So certainly, the statement about no new wafer capacity in fiscal year 2018 applies equally to both DRAM and NAND. And relative to your second question, there is not anything material relative to the CapEx guide that we shared that relates to construction costs or whatnot. As you pointed out, there is obviously incremental cleanroom space available or could be available at pretty low cost, but it would not be material in the course of the overall guide that we provided. I think in the flagship models, to answer your specific question, the demand for DRAM as well as for NAND, average capacities continues to go up. And of course, the mix of these high-end smartphones also, as a part of the total smartphone market, continues to go up. And specifically to DRAM, average capacities of DRAM in high-end smartphones, going from somewhere over 3 gigabyte in 2017, projected to go up to over 5 gigabyte, closer to 6 gigabyte by 2020 time frame. And specifically to NAND, average capacities of NAND in high-end smartphones in 2017 somewhere around 70 gigabytes, let's say, projected to double or more than double by 2020 time frame as well. So again, the average capacity increased trend in smartphones continues to be solid, not only, actually, in high-end smartphones but in value segment of the smartphone market as well. Thank you. That concludes our call today. We really appreciate your support. And as a reminder, we will be posting the prepared remarks from today's call as well as a webcast replay on our website later this afternoon.","I guess, Ernie, my first question is just around your CapEx number, $7.5 billion. That doesn't surprise me as much as your sort of guidance around bit growth for DRAM and NAND for the fiscal year just given the significant jump in CapEx. I'm wondering if you can just help me understand, to what extent is this being driven by a back-end-loaded expectation around CapEx? And how do we think about kind of the bit growth exiting next fiscal year? And I guess, at what point do you think you'd begin to start to outgrow bits relative to the industry for both DRAM and NAND? That's helpful, guys. And then Sanjay, this is my follow-on question. I think clearly, the most significant concern in the investment community is the sustainability of the current environment. So I'd love to kind of get your thoughts on sustainability. And I guess, specifically, to what extent in an environment like this can you move the business from more sort of a transactional, hand-to-mouth business to something that might have more backlog and visibility with your customers, especially as you try to move the mix towards more higher value end solutions? Question on the NAND bit growth. So the bit growth is increasing to 50% from kind of the high-30s this year. A lot of this, obviously being driven by 3D NAND. Wanted to talk about in terms of how you're seeing the supply-demand balance going into next year and the NAND environment and kind of your thoughts around pricing as we start to have more supply and the impact also to cost per bit. And just my follow-up, Sanjay. One of the positive trends that has been happening at Micron is the diversification of the end markets for DRAM. And you could just compare this cycle, say, to previous cycles maybe not just too long ago, only about 3 years ago where PCs were a higher percentage of DRAM and now they are mid-20% range today. So can you talk about that phenomenon, and you mentioned it in your prepared remarks, but the diversification of the end markets in DRAM specialty, particularly in graphics and automotive and server, how that is affecting the business model, how that is affecting the customer relationships and engagements going forward? My question is about the technology migration. You talked about the 64-layer second crossover, I believe, second half FY '18. Can you talk about what's next on NAND Flash 96-layer or whatever it is and what the timing is? And will Micron look at transitioning to a charged trap flash alternative at 96-layer or perhaps one after that? And then similarly for DRAM, when -- what is the plan for 1Y and timing for EUV? And then just as a quick follow-up if I may. When do you think you will narrow the gap or catch up potentially with Samsung in both the NAND, 3D NAND and DRAM? I mean, I think that you have alluded before to closing the gap and narrowing the gap to 0 hopefully eventually. I don't think it's happened yet. Is there an update on your thinking of when that could be? Two quick questions for me. First of all, you mentioned that as demand -- your bit growth accelerates for NAND next year, that you expect to capture some of the pent-up demand that the NAND market is seeing. I guess, I was curious if you can talk about what gives you confidence that your -- that pent-up demand hasn't actually turned into demand destruction this year, why it will still be there. And secondly, if I look at CapEx breakdown that you provided, it looks like about $1.5 billion or so is dedicated towards product enablement. And I was just curious how that number compares to maybe a year ago and if there's anything you'd say it's most focused on. Can you just give us a little color on, I guess, the 3 main end markets, server, mobile and PC on tightness or relative tightness and how it trended during the quarter? And any information, either qualitative or quantitative, you have on inventory levels out there with channel or at customers? Just on DRAM. And for my follow-up question for Sanjay. By the way, welcome to the DRAM party. You were not afraid to engage in M&A at your previous shop. Can you talk about the willingness or appetite for M&A at this point for Micron versus the desires to continue to improve the balance sheet? Ernie and Sanjay, I wanted to ask more of a strategic question. Two of your competitors in the NAND industry have been at disagreement on the trajectory of their manufacturing partnership. Are you and your existing NAND partner inclined to abstain from future partnerships? And I have a follow-up, please. Understood. Appreciate the color. I guess, for my final question. This was somewhat addressed earlier in the call. I just want to move back to just some of the content growth that we have been talking about. But our fieldwork during the quarter indicated that DRAM fulfillment rates, at least in the server market, improved from last quarter, but they were still well below 100%. Are you seeing more active engagement today with tier 2 customers for longer-term contract agreements that gives you greater confidence in your capacity planning assumptions? Just looking on the DRAM side. You mentioned the crossover of 1X nanometer. When do you expect to see that? And if you can give some color on what the cost structures are as you transition the mix to 1X. Right. Got it. And on the NAND side, obviously, pretty nice numbers on the storage business side, up 71%. But could you parse out how much is enterprise mix for you on NAND? And obviously, you guys have seen some good traction there. Where is the enterprise mix exiting next year, let's say? Looking at your production cost reduction time line. Is it fair to assume that there's going to be some slowdown as you reach crossover for 64-layer in NAND? Meaning that after that, there could be a little bit of a slowdown in terms of your ability to reduce production costs. And then if you could reiterate the production cost reduction targets for NAND and DRAM for 2018? Okay, great. And then a quick second question. So you talked about the adoption rate trajectory of SSDs in notebooks. Could you also give us your expectation both now and, say, in a year or 2 in terms of the adoption rate for SSDs in a data center and traditional enterprise server? First question is a follow-up on CapEx. I was hoping you could clarify the comment about no new wafer capacity additions. I know you said that explicitly for DRAM, but can you clarify if that also applies to NAND Flash? And on that topic, if you could help us understand to what extent you may need to invest in new cleanroom capacity as part of that CapEx guidance next year, obviously even without adding new wafer capacity that the amount of factory floor space is going up for both 1X nanometer and more so for 3D NAND. I know the company had some available. But just wondering if any of the spending relates to cleanroom capacity due to the floor space requirements. Okay. And if I could just follow up specifically on smartphone demand trends. If you could touch on what the company is seeing in terms of end demand for some of the flagship models specifically, but also if you could talk about some of the Chinese domestic OEMs, if you're starting to see any pickup in demand trends for memory from those customers.

Good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter, we demonstrated solid execution, further improved our balance sheet and began executing on our $10 billion share buyback program. We delivered strong profitability despite revenue headwinds from the inventory adjustments at several customers, and industry-wide CPU shortages. Our results also reflect our success in further diversifying our business as evidenced by record sales in our mobile, automotive and industrial businesses in the quarter. As we enter calendar 2019, we are seeing weakening demand from our customers. As a result, we are taking decisive actions, including a meaningful reduction in our fiscal 2019 CapEx plan, in both DRAM and NAND that will materially reduce our supply bit growth. I'll provide more details on these items later in the call after first reviewing the highlights of the quarter. I'll start with our execution progress. We are focused on improving our cost structure and increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio, both of which provide immediate benefits, and strengthen Micron's ability to drive long term profitable growth. Our cost reductions in DRAM and NAND have meaningfully outpaced the industry over the last 3 years. Our progress on advanced technology gives us confidence that we will deliver healthy year-over-year cost declines in DRAM and NAND in fiscal 2019, even after taking into account the supply and CapEx changes, which I referenced earlier. In the first quarter, we achieved crossover of 1X nanometer DRAM shipments, and started revenue shipments of 1Y nanometer products. Our 1Y year ramp is ahead of schedule, and we remain on track for meaningful production by the fiscal third quarter. We're also making excellent progress on our 1Z technology, which leverages our leadership in advanced materials and cost effective lithography techniques. In NAND, we continue to lead with our QLC product offerings, and have introduced both consumer QLC and VME SSDs and enterprise QLC SATA SSDs. In the first quarter, we started shipping 96-layer NAND products. Yields on 96-layer are ahead of plan. We remain focused on increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio, and investing in differentiated products for our customers. In DRAM, we introduced our 1Y nanometer 12-gigabit low-power DRAM, which offers the highest density available for the mobile market. We are seeing strong demand for this product as the market continues to move toward higher densities. In NAND, high-value solutions now represent over 50% of our NAND bits, which is an important milestone for us. The improving mix of high-value solutions increases our gross profit opportunity and provides better margin stability. The strength of our high-value solutions this quarter, which was driven by managed NAND products, helped us maintain overall NAND gross margins above 45%, despite industry oversupply. We strengthened our number 1 share position in SATA enterprise SSDs, gaining about 3 percentage points of market share sequentially, according to industry reports. In addition to the QLC consumer and VME SSD, mentioned earlier, we also introduced the industry's first one terabyte TLC and VME automotive SSD in the first quarter. We are working to further expand our NVMe [4] product portfolio, and plan to introduce SSDs targeting client, enterprise and cloud markets through the course of calendar 2019. Looking ahead, we expect the SSD market opportunity will continue to shift from SATA to NVMe. Fiscal 2019 will be a year of transition for our SSD portfolio, and we expect our SSD share gains to resume in fiscal 2020. In the meantime, the growth of our high-value NAND solutions in fiscal 2019 will be driven by our mobile managed NAND products, where we believe we have significant opportunity to increase share. In the first quarter, we shipped multiple high-capacity, high-performance UFS solutions, nearly tripling our bit shipments quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in developing high-value solutions using our 3D XPoint technology and plan to introduce differentiated products towards the end of calendar 2019, as previously discussed. Our conviction in the opportunities ahead is reflected in our October announcement that we intend to exercise our option to acquire Intel's interest in the IMFT Facility in Lehi, Utah, early in calendar 2019. Now turning to end markets. I will start first with mobile, where we set records for revenue, gross margins and operating margins in the first fiscal quarter. In addition to strong seasonal sales, we benefited from major product wins with several customers, which is driving our managed NAND share gains. We are seeing strong demand elasticity in this market, and within our MCP portfolio, our average NAND density was up over 25% sequentially, and over 150% year-on-year. Content growth also continues to do well in mobile DRAM, with more than 25% growth in density per unit shipped on a year-on-year basis. We expect content growth to continue in mobile devices, driven by broader use of artificial intelligence, and the increasing number of cameras in the average smartphone. These elements will become pervasive, while the industry readies for 5G implementation. In data center markets, we saw reduced revenue coming off a record-setting fiscal fourth quarter, due primarily to inventory adjustments at our customers. We expect this headwind will persist for a couple of quarters. We are seeing some cloud customers go through a digestion period following very strong growth over the last 2 years. We believe we are still in the early innings of cloud growth and long-term end customer demand trends remain strong in this market. Our engagement with our customers continues to be deep, and now includes collaboration on our 3D XPoint product roadmap. Higher density DRAM products are seeing stronger demand across the data center market. Revenue from our high-density 64 gigabyte DRAM modules grew more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We are focused on the upcoming industry transition from 8 to 16 gigabit DRAM, and expect to start sampling our new 16 gigabit DRAM by our fiscal third quarter. In graphics, we started volume ramp of our high-performance GDDR6 memory, and are working closely with our key customers in this segment. Higher-than-normal inventories in gaming cards and the fall off in crypto-related demand created revenue headwinds, which we expect to continue for a couple more quarters. Looking ahead, we see broadening interest in high-performance graphics memory for AI enablement in segments like data center and automotive. Our product leadership in GDDR6 is already creating new opportunities in these segments. Turning to markets requiring our long life cycle products. In the fiscal first quarter, we had record revenue in auto and industrial markets, with a sequential expansion in gross margins. Strength in automotive continues to be driven by increasing demand for in-vehicle infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems. As a result, we see strong demand for our latest generation of automotive products. In November, we announced a collaboration with BMW to define and validate next generation automotive solutions. This is another proof point of Micron's leadership in automotive, and the growing criticality of memory and storage to leading-edge automotive applications. Turning to our DRAM industry outlook. As I've mentioned previously, DRAM demand weakened through the course of our fiscal first quarter. Since the start of this fiscal second quarter, the weakening demand trend has continued, and our near-term visibility is limited. Due to a lengthy period of rising DRAM prices, we believe some of our customers had decided to carry higher-than-normal inventory levels, and as DRAM supply caught up with demand, these customers are bringing down their inventory levels. Smartphone unit demand is also continuing to weaken, particularly, at a high-end in what is seasonally slow quarter for mobile. Lastly, we are continuing to see the impact of CPU shortages. While our customers' end market demand in segments like industrial, cloud, enterprise and client compute is healthy, this inventory adjustment period will contribute to weaker demand conditions in DRAM that will likely persist through the first half of calendar 2019. We now expect DRAM bit demand growth for the industry in calendar 2019 at approximately 16%, compared with our prior expectation of approximately 20%. Even after factoring in the recent CapEx cuts publicly announced across the industry, DRAM supply growth is tracking above our view of demand growth in calendar 2019. Given this supply-demand dynamic, we are taking decisive actions to lower our DRAM bit output growth to approximately 15% for calendar 2019, versus our prior plan of around 20% bit growth. These actions include a significant reduction to our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2019. Based on our current demand estimates, our DRAM bit shipments for the fiscal second quarter will decline sequentially, but more importantly, are likely to be flat to down on a year-over-year basis as well, consistent with a weak quarter for the memory industry and significantly below the long-term demand growth rate. This shows that inventory adjustments by our customers are well underway. Barring weaker macroeconomic conditions, we expect our DRAM bit demand to grow sequentially in our fiscal third quarter. Looking beyond fiscal Q3, as we enter the second half of calendar 2019, we expect a healthier demand environment alongside an improved industry supply picture, which should contribute to improved financial performance. In NAND, while the inventory levels at customers are in better shape, NAND suppliers appear to have elevated levels of inventory. The transition from planar to 3D NAND in the industry and successful ramp of 64-layer across the NAND manufacturers has resulted in oversupply in the market over the last several quarters. We currently expect calendar 2019 NAND industry bit demand growth to be approximately 35%, with ongoing impacts due to client compute CPU shortages, and weaker high-end smartphone unit demand. Even after taking into account recently publicly announced NAND CapEx reductions for calendar 2019, our assessment is that the NAND industry supply growth will exceed industry demand growth in the coming calendar year. We are, therefore, lowering our 2019 planned NAND bit growth, and further reducing our fiscal 2019 NAND CapEx. We now expect our calendar 2019 NAND supply bit growth to be meaningfully reduced from prior expectations, and expect our bit shipment growth to be in line with the industry demand at approximately 35%. We also expect NAND demand to accelerate in the second half of the calendar year, as demand elasticity kicks in for the mobile, enterprise and client markets. Given our attractive cost structure on leading-edge NAND and DRAM, in this market environment, we will manage pricing and carry inventory as necessary to optimize our profitability. We are taking decisive action on the supply side to manage our business in a prudent fashion, with an eye towards delivering a robust return on our investments. Our actions will significantly reduce our fiscal 2019 CapEx and allow us to continue delivering strong profitability and healthy free cash flow, while investing in our strategic priorities as we position Micron to capitalize on the exciting growth opportunities for the company. I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide financial details of our fiscal first quarter and guidance for the second quarter. Thanks, Sanjay. Micron delivered strong results in our fiscal first quarter, including double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue, gross profits, and earnings per share. While our near-term outlook has become more challenging, the actions taken to improve our cost structure and increase our mix of high-value solutions, will ensure that our profitability profile remains strong. Moreover, Micron's financial position remains healthy, with an improved net cash position and with total liquidity reaching our target levels. Total fiscal first quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, up 16% from the prior year, and down 6% from the record fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue was adversely impacted by inventory adjustments at key customers in the cloud, graphics and enterprise markets. Offsetting these headwinds, we delivered record revenue in the mobile, industrial and automotive markets. DRAM represented 68% of total company revenue in the fiscal first quarter. DRAM revenue increased 18% year-over-year and declined 9% from the prior quarter. On a blended basis, DRAM ASPs declined high single digits percent compared to the prior quarter, while shipment quantities were relatively flat. Trade NAND revenue represented 28% of total company revenue in the fiscal first quarter. Trade NAND revenue increased 17% year-over-year and declined 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our overall NAND ASP declined in the low- to mid-teens percent, and shipment quantities increased in the low to mid-teens percent, compared to the prior quarter. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $3.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year and down 17% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline was driven by the impact of inventory adjustments at some of our customers in the graphics, enterprise and cloud markets. The Mobile Business Unit delivered a strong quarter, with record revenue of $2.2 billion, revenue increased 62% year-over-year and 17% from the prior quarter. Revenue growth was driven by the continued strength of our low-power DRAM offerings, and share gains in our mobile managed NAND business with several leading handset customers. Embedded Business Unit revenue of $933 million was up 12% year-on-year, and up 1% quarter-on-quarter. The automotive and industrial business -- businesses had record revenue, driven by strong sales of our DRAM and NOR products. And finally, turning to the Storage Business Unit, or SBU, fiscal first quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, down 17% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline in revenue was driven by weaker pricing and the ongoing transition from SATA to NVMe SSDs. The impact of this transition will continue through calendar 2019. Our strategy to move bits from SBU components to high-value solutions in mobile is also contributing to a decline in revenue for SBU. The consolidated gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 59%, up 360 basis points from the prior year, and down approximately 230 basis points from the prior quarter. This includes a 120 basis point impact from 3D XPoint underutilization costs. During the last few months, we successfully leveraged our global supply chain to mitigate the impact of the China trade tariffs to less than 50 basis points to our consolidated fiscal first quarter gross margin. We expect to be able to mitigate approximately 90% of the impact from tariffs starting in January 2019. We believe that Micron will not be directly impacted by any expansion of trade tariffs to additional product categories. Operating expenses were $783 million, slightly above our guidance, mainly due to higher-than-expected prequalification expenses associated with new product introductions. Looking forward, as our joint development work with Intel comes to a conclusion around the end of this fiscal year, the R&D cost-sharing between the companies will naturally reduce and come to an end. In the fiscal first quarter, Intel's share of joint R&D expenses was approximately $30 million. We expect that our R&D expenses will continue to increase in the coming quarters, due to the combination of these declining R&D contributions from Intel, as well as increased investments in future technologies and high-value solutions across our portfolio. We continue to drive strong profitability in the fiscal first quarter, with operating income of $3.9 billion, representing 49% of revenue. This margin is up 3 percentage points year-over-year and down 3 percentage points from the fiscal fourth quarter. As previously mentioned, the improvements that Micron has made over the prior several years have resulted in structurally higher margins. The tax rate for the fiscal first quarter was 10%, and we expect our fiscal year 2019 tax rate to be around 11%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fiscal first quarter totaled $2.97, up from $2.45 in the year ago quarter and down from $3.53 in the prior quarter. We commenced our capital return program in the fiscal first quarter with the repurchase of $1.8 billion of common stock, representing a reduction of approximately 42 million shares or about 3.5% of shares outstanding. We expect to remain active with our stock buybacks in the fiscal second quarter, as we continue to make progress on our $10 billion repurchase program by returning at least 50% of our ongoing free cash flows to shareholders. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. In the fiscal first quarter, we generated $4.8 billion in cash from operations, representing 61% of revenue. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions, was $2.5 billion, up from $2.1 billion in the prior quarter. In the fiscal first quarter, our free cash flow was approximately $2.3 billion, up about $600 million from the year ago quarter, and down approximately $750 million from the prior quarter. We deployed approximately 80% of the quarter's free cash flow towards our share repurchase program. Even with the substantial outlay for share repurchases, we ended the fiscal quarter in a record net cash position of $3.1 billion, with approximately $7.2 billion in cash, marketable investments and restricted cash, and $4.1 billion in debt. While we largely completed our deleveraging activities in fiscal year 2018, we further reduced our debt balance in the quarter by approximately $500 million through the settlement of outstanding convertible note redemptions of $160 million and other scheduled payments. Overall, our solid balance sheet, strong cash flow, and robust liquidity put us in an excellent position to execute on our capital returns program. Prior to issuing our fiscal second quarter guidance, I'd like to provide some context for our outlook. Due to the weaker demand environment, we expect fiscal second quarter sequential bit shipments to be down meaningfully for both NAND and DRAM. Given the weaker near-term outlook, we are lowering our CapEx plans to a range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion for fiscal 2019. At the midpoint, this represents a $1.25 billion reduction from our prior guidance, and our front-end equipment CapEx is now down year-on-year. We'll continue to remain flexible with capital spending to respond to market conditions. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal second quarter is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.3 billion; and gross margins to be in the range of 50% to 53%; operating expenses are expected to be $800 million, plus or minus $25 million. As we execute on longer-term growth investments, we're actively managing OpEx by implementing expense controls across the company, including tighter controls on headcount, holiday work schedule slowdowns and reductions in discretionary spending. Based on a share count of approximately 1.15 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.75, plus or minus $0.10. In closing, Micron continues to deliver solid financial results on a stronger performance foundation. We are making progress on all of our key initiatives, including our high-value solutions product portfolio, our cost profile, capital return program, and financial structure, with a record net cash position, and $9.7 billion of liquidity at the end of the fiscal first quarter. While near-term market conditions are challenging, we are taking appropriate steps to manage production and spending, in order to deliver healthy profitability and cash flows. There is no doubt Micron remains in the strongest financial position in the company's history, as we transition to next-generation technologies and products. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks. Thank you, Dave. While we end calendar 2018 on the heels of unprecedented profitability and revenue for both Micron and the industry, we do believe we are entering a period of weaker market conditions. We are taking prudent actions to adapt our manufacturing plans to the changing demand environment. While we are implementing expense controls, we are also continuing to invest in our technology and cost competitiveness, as well as strengthening our portfolio of high-value solutions. Memory and storage have become essential ingredients to the value created by the data economy, and it is this added value that is driving a virtual cycle of long-term growth and innovation. We continue to believe that the memory industry is structurally stronger, with more diversified demand drivers and moderating supply growth capability. Micron is better positioned than ever before to win in this environment with our strong balance sheet and the structural improvements we have made to our operating model in the past several years. We believe 2019 will be a year of solid profitability, and I look forward to sharing our results over the quarters ahead. We will now open for questions.","So inventory at our customers and this is -- customers in various segments of our market, some of those customers are carrying higher levels of inventory, and that inventory level varies from customer to customer, we believe. And our assessment is that inventory adjustments will take couple of quarters for it to be corrected, for it to work through the system entirely and, of course, we continue to work with our customers in the meantime, in terms of understanding their longer-term demand requirements. And, certainly, our customers are indicating optimism towards the demand requirements in the second half of the year, and especially, as inventory adjustments work through the system and as supply cuts, the effect of those come through the industry, as well as second half of the calendar year tends to be seasonally stronger, compared to the first half of the year, we do expect that by the second half of the year, we'll have an environment that will be improved, stronger, compared to the first half of the year. And just keep in mind that the long-term demand trends in our end markets of cloud, client, enterprise, graphics, all of these end markets, the trends continue to be strong, needing more memory and more storage ultimately. We're just going through an air pocket here, related to primarily inventory adjustments, as well as some seasonal, weak mobile demand, including mobile demand on the high-end smartphones that is impacting some of our near-term visibility, as well as the near-term outlook. So we are reducing our production for both DRAM and NAND. As Sanjay indicated, from a DRAM perspective, we're bringing bit supply growth down to 15% approximately in calendar year 2019. For NAND, we're also bringing the production down meaningfully, and we did indicate that we would ship close to demand for NAND, and we think that demand is about 35%. So, obviously, there will be periods of time where we do have inventory increasing for some period of time and then, of course, it will adjust down through the years as we -- as those demand and supply numbers get more aligned. In the first quarter, we had days of inventory up to 107 days, I'm very comfortable with 107 days. This is very low cost product that we're putting on the balance sheet. There is no risk around obsolescence, it's part -- it's very likely that it will go up again next quarter. Again, I'm very comfortable with that. But I think over the long term, we'll have it more aligned with ultimately where we want it to be. Yes, good question. So we did guide $800 million for OpEx in the second quarter, plus or minus $25 million. That's probably -- that's certainly not fully burdened. We had about $30 million of benefit in the first fiscal quarter related to Intel's contribution through R&D expenses. It will be a little bit less in the second quarter, but over the course of the rest of the year, it will kind of phase down. So that certainly will elevate the OpEx in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter. And also, we're not -- while we are certainly managing expenses prudently and we are taking steps in terms of reducing discretionary spending and just monitoring our head count very closely, we still are making the necessary investments on the product side and the non-technology side. This is as Sanjay mentioned, and air pocket, we don't want to in any way, impact our long term strategy for some sort of near-term event. So OpEx will likely go up a little bit. It's a fair point on the OpEx. I would say, if you look at the guidance for the second quarter or even with the revenue guidance we gave relative to what the first quarter was like, if you take the kind of midpoint of the earnings number, and the midpoint of the revenue guidance number, you'll get kind of 38% plus operating margin. So that is a really good number obviously. It's a number of, in my previous company, we were kind of aspirationally trying to get to. So it's a very good operation -- operating margin number. And I think it reflects the fact that we achieved the $6 billion of improvements that we said we would make at the Analyst Day. We still think we have more work to do in terms of driving the mix towards high-value solutions in terms of improving our cost competitiveness, both on the front-end and on the back-end side. So there is more to come, there is another $3 billion that we committed, and we feel very good about that. So I think our inventory, our cost structure is very good, both on DRAM as well as on the NAND side. And so we are definitely prepared that in terms of managing our overall profitability, which is absolutely our primary focus, that we'll manage pricing and manage inventory accordingly, as necessary. If inventor has to be carried over, we will carry it over, because the demand in NAND will kick in with elasticity. In DRAM, the inventory consumption with our customers will occur, supply cuts will be driving return to stronger demand environment, compared to -- in the second half, compared to first half. So we will be using inventory as a lever to ultimately manage for the best profitability of the company. And certainly, be prepared, use that inventory as necessary to also capitalize on the second half opportunities. And our focus really will also remain that in terms of our CAGR, in terms of output growth, to be aligned with the demand CAGR. And we'll, of course, from time-to-time, use inventory as a lever to manage the profitability of our business and, of course, manage our customers' requirements as well. With respect to the cost structure, we continue to be in very good position, as we said, that for our fiscal year '19, we'll have healthy cost reductions, both for NAND as well as DRAM. And you're, of course, right to note that as we increase the mix of our high-value solutions, for example, over the longer term as we increase our SSD mix or increase our managed NAND solutions, those do tend to incur higher costs. But they also bring higher margins, higher profitability, higher pricing associated with them as well. So cost wise, we are in good shape. Yes, good question, C.J. So, we contribute -- let's start with the -- we're at about $9.7 billion of liquidity when you count the cash that we have on the balance sheet, plus the $2.5 billion revolver we have. So we're in, as you point out, very good shape relative to where our target at liquidity would be. You saw a pretty healthy return of cash to shareholders in the first quarter. About 80% of our free cash flow went to shareholders in the form of the buyback, and really, the rest went to further deleverage the balance sheet. There's not a ton of deleveraging that will go on through the rest of the year, quite honestly. And so I would expect us to be -- continue to be good buyers of the stock, so to speak, through the next 3 quarters, and contribute a high portion of our free cash flow in the form of a buyback. So, certainly, we are taking actions, a range of actions, and we won't really get into any specifics here in terms of what actions we are taking to reduce our output. You earlier mentioned about inventory. I mean, of course, we will carry inventory as necessary to manage the profitability. But important thing to understand is that we are taking decisive actions in terms of reducing our production output, both in NAND as well as in DRAM. And that's the contributor to the $1.25 billion reduction in CapEx, compared to our prior guidance. And, of course, our intention here is to align our supply output in line with the industry demand trends. And we feel very good about the actions we have taken. In DRAM, we've pointed out that compared to our prior expectations of 20% supply bit growth in calendar 2019, we have taken actions now to reduce our output to provide a 15% supply output growth on a year-over-year basis. And in DRAM as well, we have taken actions to adjust our output so that our shipments will match with our demand that we expect to be around 35% in 2019. And I just wanted to make it very clear here -- and I just want to be very clear as we have always said, that we are not adding any new wafer capacity. We are -- the CapEx that we discussed today, the lowered CapEx that we discussed, which on a wafer equipment basis is a reduction from fiscal year '18 CapEx, is all going towards technology transitions only. And that, of course, is the best way to achieve the ROI on those investments. So, Mark, I'm not going to get into the specifics. Most important thing is, we have managed our CapEx lower, and we continue to take actions to manage our production output lower to align our supply with our demand expectations. And I think the effect of these actions will in fact, some of these actions will start showing as early as this quarter. And if you look at our gross margin guidance. Go ahead, sorry Mark. I was just going to say, if you look at our gross margin guidance, it would reflect that we have a very good cost structure for our products. And the reduction of these output that we are talking about, our cost structure will remain in very good shape, even with that. And in fact, in terms of cost, on a year-over-year basis, we actually, our cost reductions we believe both in DRAM and NAND, will be above the industry. Cost reductions remain above the industry, yes. So first of all, I think we should realize that the end market demand trends, by and large, really remain quite healthy and our customers also are absolutely continuing to show to us the optimism around the long-term demand trends. And as we noted in my remarks, that in our fiscal second quarter, the bits for DRAM, let me first talk about DRAM here, the bits for DRAM will be down on a year-over-year basis, and this needs to be compared with the long-term DRAM demand CAGR of 20%, high teens to 20% range. So, when in FQ2, on a year-over-year basis, you reduction and you contrast it with the long-term demand trends of 20% kind of demand growth, then it tells you that during fiscal second quarter, a lot of the inventory adjustments will certainly be occurring. And that's why we say that it will take couple of quarters for inventory adjustments to occur. So again, the point about year-over-year reduction in our DRAM shipments is an important point in understanding that the inventory adjustment by our customers is well underway. And all of this, while the end market demand drivers of cloud, as you see from all the data, is absolutely continuing to be healthy, the end market demand driver in terms of average capacity increases of flash and smartphones, as well as DRAM content and smartphones driven by AI and machine learning, continues to be on the upward trend. And of course, applications like automotive and industrial IoT, with more AI and more machine learning, all of these are continuing to drive the demand trends toward a need for more storage and more memory. And we laid out some of these opportunities at our Investor Day, and all of those opportunities very much stay intact, and at the end market level, continue to be vibrant. So, I think these couple of points that the November quarter itself was, in terms of overall shipment, was below seasonal, as well as the first quarter, on a year-over-year basis, really showing reduction, points to inventory adjustments are well underway. And, of course, you have to look at this in the backdrop that the output in the industry is coming down as well. We have announced our decisive actions here today, and we have provided the outlook in terms of our output growth in calendar year '19, both for NAND as well as DRAM. So these -- and then, as I said before, that second half of the year tends to be a seasonally stronger part in terms of demand compared to the first half. So these all are definitely pointing to our confidence, and built up on inputs from our customers in terms of second half of the year being stronger than the first half of the year in terms of -- in demand trends and the industry fundamentals as well. And let me just point out one more thing here, that when you look at industry, I mean, compared to the past cycles, really the CapEx cuts are happening at much, much earlier level in the cycle. And really, in terms of happening even at much higher levels of profitability than ever in the past. So all this, overall, I believe, bodes well for the long term fundamentals of the industry as well as, certainly, for Micron. I think in that regard, you know as much as I do, and over the course of last couple of months, there have been a reduction that have been discussed in the industry, the reductions that you have heard about, that manufacturers have talked about, but also, several analysts have indicated those as well. And of course, the near-term outlook has also, as we said, continued to weaken through the course of our FQ1 time frame and even since our FQ2 has started, those demand weakening trends have continued as well. So I think that this is the information that is out there, is what we're using, but we can only talk about ourselves and we can -- we certainly have taken here decisive actions in terms of managing our output growth in line with our demand expectations. Certainly, as we have been speaking for a while, the transition from SATA to NVMe is taking place at a fast pace in enterprise, as well as in cloud applications. And we have been focused on developing our own products. And that's why we have said that in calendar year -- our fiscal year 2019, as we bring out our new NVMe products to the market, our 2019 calendar year ends up being more a year of transition for us. But there is no question that the market certainly is moving from SATA to NVMe applications across-the-board. And we have just introduced some of our early NVMe products for consumer SSDs, and I talked about how we have introduced NVMe product for automotive applications as well. And during the course of calendar 2019, we'll first be bringing out client NVMe products to the market, and then later in the year, we'll bring enterprise and cloud NVMe SSDs. And that's why we look at calendar year 2020 will be the one time frame when we start gaining share again in our SSDs -- SSD market. I think what we have shown you today is that we are able to take decisive actions and we are able to take them fast. I mean, just remember that FQ4 was a record year for the company. And FQ1 is when we first saw signs of inventory adjustment. During the course of FQ1, we have been able to react in terms of cutting down our CapEx, as well as manage our output growth. So point is, we can react fast to the changes that are needed in the marketplace, and we remain, this is something we review very, very closely on an ongoing basis, very focused on making sure that we are maximizing the long-term profitability and long-term growth opportunity for Micron. So this is something that in terms of cost, we feel very good about our position for 2019 and beyond -- going beyond that. We of course continue to make very good progress on our technology nodes. As I discussed with you, our technology on 1Z is progressing well. We feel good about that roadmap and continue to make good progress on our NAND roadmap as well. And that will all position us well for 2019 as well as for 2020 time frame. And I just want to point out that our focus also is on shifting our portfolio to high-value solutions, and those will also strengthen our profitability profile. So, I will just touch on CapEx, on your previous question on cost, I also wanted to point out that on the cost side, we are making tremendous progress on the back-end assembly and test cost reductions, as well as managing, transforming our supply chain operations, which will give us significant cost benefits as well. So, all in all, 2019 and beyond feel very good about our technology roadmap, manufacturing roadmap capability, as well as overall cost capabilities. In terms of, on the CapEx side, just keep in mind that we have said that with the adjustments that we just have made, over wafer equipment CapEx actually is coming down in fiscal year '19 versus fiscal year '18. And as we've discussed before, Micron over the last few years, have significantly underinvested in clean room shell CapEx in the facilities and the buildings that are needed to really implement ongoing future technology transitions and a big part of our CapEx, as we have shared with you the past, actually is going towards buildings and facilities, clean room that will be needed for future technology transitions as well. All of that CapEx does not contribute to bit growth. And similarly, we a have significant increase in our CapEx in fiscal year '19 over fiscal year '18 on back-end test and assembly operations as well. And that is, again, intended to reduce costs, and not -- it doesn't go towards any bit growth. And we have flexibility, as we have shown already, in terms of managing CapEx. We'll continue to look at this carefully. And if any factors require us to change our CapEx outlook again, we will absolutely address it in a timely and prudent fashion. We always continue to evaluate market environment, as well as our own status of technology, transitions, production requirements, and we are making real-time adjustments as needed. Again, in terms of cost per bit, there are a lot of details that have to be looked at. We're not going to get into all of those details here. Key message here is that we are bringing our production output in line with our demand expectations. Second, we feel very good about our technology position and our cost position, and we'll continue to do very well in this regard. Cost position, of course, includes wafer level, die cost position, but also includes the benefits of assembly and test cost improvements that we are making; and third, is we absolutely stay focused on our high-value solutions strategy, and we're executing well in this area. We talked about how in mobile, even in a market environment of significant NAND oversupply, we actually have delivered strong gains in our mobile high-value solutions portfolio as well.","Thank you, Sanjay, I was wondering if you could help quantify the inventory at your big hyper scale customers? It sounds like in aggregate it's maybe 2 months. So I'm wondering if you can help with that number? And then I guess just as a quick follow-up, Dave. So I think maybe the surprise in the guidance is that the bit shipments are down, I think you said, meaningfully for both NAND and DRAM. I'm wondering, what that means for inventories? Are you going to ship out of inventory? Or are you cutting utilization? Can you sort of walk us through that? Dave, just relative to the guidance for OpEx in February quarter of $800 million, plus or minus $25 million, does that now reflect what we should think about as a fully burdened OpEx as you kind of move away from the shared cost with Intel? And relative to the $6 billion of operational efficiency gains you talked about at the Analyst Day this past summer, how does that fit in with this OpEx guide? Because this is about $200 million more OpEx per quarter than we saw at similar revenue levels back in sort of '16, '17, and it's about $300 million above per quarter what we saw kind of in the '15 sort of correction? And then as my follow-up for Sanjay. Can you just walk us through the strategic puts and takes of building inventory into the February quarter, as opposed to trying to let those bits out into the marketplace and let elasticity sort of take over? Is this sort of intangible reflection of your view that this will be relatively short-lived a couple of quarters? And what would you need to see before you would think that inventory build was too risky? I guess, first question, can you talk about what you're thinking in terms of cost down efforts both for DRAM and NAND, particularly as you move to higher-value solutions, changing mix, including 1Y, 1Z, as well as 96 layers in the '19 time frame? That's helpful. And I guess, as a follow-up, a question for you, Dave. I think in the past you've talked about wanting to have liquidity, including gross cash and revolver, of roughly 1 year CapEx, which would basically put you on the screws here. So the question is, how to think about incremental free cash flow generation? And what percentage of that would be used for buybacks? First question really, I'd like to ask on the supply adjustments you're making, you're taking down the guidance for both DRAM and NAND production. You mentioned about some of that being inventory, but you also mentioned some of that being some reduction adjustments. It would be useful to understand a bit more about that. For example, is that reduction of utilization? Is that a no more capacity additions? Or what is that? Because some of your competitors have been pushing out some of their capacity additions. And so it would be useful to understand what Micron is doing here on the capacity adjustments to get this slightly lower bit growth that you are forecasting for calendar '19? So does that mean slower technology migration? Or does it perhaps mean slightly lower utilization for a temporary period? Thanks Sanjay and then... All right, go ahead. You go ahead, Dave, first. My follow-up question is on the demand. You talked about this a little bit of an inventory correction amongst customers, some of your competitors have talked a bit about that as well. But you seem to be reasonably confident that demand is going to come back second half of calendar '19, which also suggests that the inventory should have been burnt up by then. The customer's inventory should have been used up mostly by then. It would just be helpful, do you have any data points to explain how you get that confidence that demand will come back? Is it perhaps on the NAND side more about demand elasticity? Is it on the DRAM side? Anything about the kind of magnitude of the inventory level the customers have today to give us some kind of sense that -- confidence that, that would've been used up within a couple of quarters, for example? That'll be great, that would be very helpful. I was wondering if I could build on that last comment, you've talked a lot about your own plans in terms of curtailing your capacity expansion this year. But given that you are in off quarter, off calendar quarter, I'm just curious of how you will characterize maybe the competitive landscape, maybe what you've seen change over the last month and a half or so, relative to some of your competitors in the context of both DRAM and NAND? And I have a follow-up. Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, just thinking about your product portfolio, particularly around the enterprise SSD market, I'm curious, it sounds like possibly you're seeing maybe even a quicker ramp towards NVMe than what you previously have seen. I mean, is there a way to kind of quantify how much of maybe the enterprise SSD market is kind of moving away from you until you get your products into the market in the latter part of this calendar year -- or calendar year '19? Sanjay, I heard you indicate that you expect above average cost declines, but I guess my question is, aren't the actions that you've announced today probably more of a hit to cost per bit in 2020 versus 2019? How do we think about that? I guess as my follow-up, on CapEx, I mean, you are cutting your forecast for the year, but CapEx is still up on a year-on-year basis. I'm curious, if this downturn ends up being longer than any of us sort of anticipate, is there leverage to reduce CapEx even further from current levels? I mean, it seems like the actions you guys are taking are very prudent, but I -- the part that's confusing for me is, if you're slowing your process migration, then there should be some impact to cost per bit. And I'm just, I guess I'm just not quite, I just don't quite understand what that impact is?

Good afternoon. During the second quarter, Micron, once again, set company performance records across multiple metrics, including revenue, gross profit, EPS and cash generation. We are consistently delivering results that underscore our relentless focus on execution and solid progress on our strategic priorities. Specifically, we are evolving our product portfolio to a richer mix of high-value solutions, enhancing our financial performance and cultivating deeper relationships with more key customers across multiple mega markets. Our growing portfolio of managed NAND solutions and low-power DDR4 products boosted our mobile business to record revenue and profitability during the quarter. We also grew our SSD shares in our second quarter with total SSD sales up 80% year-over-year and sales of cloud and enterprise drives more than tripling for that same period. Continued strong penetration of our highly competitive DDR4 products into cloud applications and our industry-leading high-performance graphics memory portfolio into gaming, graphics and cryptomining applications contributed to a robust 15% sequential growth for our Compute and Networking Business Unit. Strong demand for our DRAM and NAND products delivered record second quarter revenues for us in the automotive market. We continue to execute well on our goal of introducing new products on our advanced technologies, delivering performance, quality, supply and cost advantages to our customers. In NAND, we are transitioning from being the components supplier to becoming a solutions provider. We launched and began qualifications of the industry's first cloud and enterprise SATA SSD drive incorporating 64-layer 3D TLC NAND. We also introduced the 3DFS solutions targeted at flagship smartphones. These solutions are also based on our 64-layer 3D TLC NAND, which has 15% higher performance and double the density of the prior technology. We have qualified a family of these products with a major chipset vendor and we expect to complete customer qualification in the coming months. In DRAM, our focus remains on enhancing our cost competitiveness and accelerating our product execution. We have qualified our 1X nanometer DRAM at 3 of the world's largest hyperscale customers, with other qualifications underway. We also garnered positive feedback on our 1X nanometer LPDRAM solutions and set industry benchmarks for power efficiency, which is particularly critical to our mobile customers. Our comprehensive and expanding portfolio of DRAM, NAND and NOR solutions has enabled us to achieve record design wins for our automotive business in the first half of fiscal 2018. We believe we are well positioned to continue to support our share leadership in this rapidly growing market. These achievements illustrate our focus and the ability to deliver value to both our customers and shareholders. I'll now discuss some of the trends we are seeing across our end markets, which will continue to expand the significant opportunities for our business in the years ahead. At Mobile World Congress recently, phone manufacturers featured high-end smartphones with larger 4K displays, multiple high resolution cameras and 4K HDR video recording. Capabilities like these have driven increased memory and storage requirements in recent years. But perhaps, most impressive were the multiple implementations of artificial intelligence and virtual reality. OEMs are bundling new artificial intelligence, augmented reality. OEMs are building new artificial intelligence, augmented reality and lifelike virtual reality capabilities into high-end smartphones, including facial and voice recognition, realtime translation, fast image search and scene detection. To support these data intensive capabilities, flagship and high-end smartphones are migrating towards 6 gigabytes of LPDRAM, a trend that bodes well for Micron given our leadership in LPDRAM power efficiency, which is essential for optimizing battery life. Average storage SSDs are also increasing across all smartphone classes with new flagship models using 64 gigabytes of flash memory at a minimum. Micron's portfolio of managed NAND solution is well-suited to address this growing demand, and we are leading the industry in TLC utilization with a portfolio that leverages the strong attributes of our 3D NAND technology. Of course, the growing adoption of AI is not limited to mobile. At the Consumer Electronics Show, several companies showed AI smart cockpits in new automotive models. These systems integrate the instrument dashboard, infotainment and telematic systems with a centralized compute and storage architecture to create a data center on wheels. Voice and gesture recognition, combined with driver alert monitoring capabilities, are making automobiles more intelligent and much more compute intensive, requiring higher capacity and more powerful memory and storage solutions. Micron is already working with automotive customers who will benefit from our highest speed automotive-grade, LPDDR4 solutions in the near term and new memory technologies in the future like our high-bandwidth GDDR6 graphics memory. The new features in mobile, automotive and other connected devices require rapid data analysis in storage and enterprise and cloud servers, including machine learning, training and inferencing to complement the compute taking place at the edge. This is driving significant investments in the data center and growing demand for both memory and high-performance storage. Micron's broad technology portfolio and strong innovation engine position us well for these growth trends. We continue to partner with our customers to ensure our technology and engineering roadmaps deliver the critical features for tomorrow's solutions. Now I will provide an update to near-term industry supply/demand dynamics. The dealer market today is very different from the PC-dominated market of the past. This market now supports a healthy demand environment with several secular demand drivers that I have discussed earlier. More specifically, memory is making possible applications such as AI and VR, and enabling new cloud-based business models which deliver a fundamental value far in excess of a price per bit. Against this healthy demand backdrop, we project DRAM industry bit output to grow in the 20% range for calendar 2018, maintaining favorable industry fundamentals. For the NAND market, we believe the ongoing transition to 64-layer 3D NAND creates the opportunity for a more balanced industry dynamic in calendar 2018 versus the constrained conditions we saw in 2017. We expect industry bit output growth to be somewhat higher than 45% in calendar 2018, providing incremental supply to address the increasing demand created with the further displacement of HDDs in client, enterprise and cloud applications. From a Micron perspective, we continue to make significant strides to strengthen our competitive position through technology and cost improvements. In DRAM, we are focused on accelerating our technology transition cadence and ramped our 1X nanometer technology to mature yield faster than any of our previous technology nodes. We remain on track to achieve 1X nanometer bit output crossover relative to our 20-nanometer node by the end of calendar 2018. We now expect Micron's calendar 2018 DRAM bit output growth to be in line with the industry's 20% range. In NAND, our 64-layer technology continues to ramp very well with yields somewhat ahead of plan. We continue to execute plans to achieve bit output crossover on our 64-layer 3D NAND technology relative to 32-layer in the second half of fiscal 2018. We believe we will be somewhat above industry bit output growth in calendar 2018 for NAND. We expect to deliver qualification samples to OEM customers of both our 1Y DRAM technology and our third generation 3D NAND technology by the end of fiscal 2018. And we continue to expect to ramp initial volume for each of these new nodes in the second half of calendar 2018. For some time now, industry participants have pointed out that the cost and complexity of DRAM and NAND scaling is increasing with each subsequent technology node. Additional space and equipment is required to manufacture the increasingly complex architectures of these leading technologies to maintain data capacity and meet market demand. Accordingly, we are executing plans to add clean room space in our NAND and DRAM SAS network. With the support of the Singapore Economic Development Board, we have finalized plans to build additional shelf space in Singapore, adjacent to our existing NAND Center of Excellence. The primary purpose for this new clean room space will be to transition our existing wafer capacity to future 3D NAND nodes. This location will enable us to drive efficiencies of scale. We expect to build out this facility in phases, in line with our manufacturing requirements and market demands. The first phase of this clean room is expected to be completed by the summer of 2019, with initial wafer output from the facility expected in the fourth quarter of calendar 2019. We are also building out incremental clean room space in our fab in Hiroshima, Japan, which will be available for production at the beginning of calendar year 2019. This clean room space will be used to continue our 1Y nanometer DRAM transition. For fiscal year 2018, we expect our capital expenditures to be in the upper end of our previously guided range of $7.5 billion, plus or minus 5%. Long term, we target capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to be in the low 30% range. Before we move to the next section of our call, I would like to address a supplier maintenance issue, disrupting nitrogen supply to 1 of our 5 DRAM SAS which occurred on Tuesday of this week. We expect this event will impact our DRAM production output by 2% to 3% for the quarter. Our teams are working around-the-clock to recover from the situation and we expect to return to full production within the next week. Lastly, I would like to welcome Dave Zinsner as our CFO. Dave brings years of experience within the semiconductor industry, and we are happy to have him on board. Dave will now provide details on our second quarter results and third quarter outlook. Thank you, Sanjay. I'm excited to be joining Micron at a time when the company is accelerating its focus on execution, including the delivery of more high-value solutions and the ongoing improvement of cost competitiveness. During my first few weeks at the company, I've been diving into the details of the business and operations, and I'm more convinced than ever that there's a fantastic opportunity to build an even stronger company while continuing to enhance shareholder value. For the second fiscal quarter, revenues were $7.35 billion, up 8% from the prior quarter and 58% from the prior year. The overall strength reflects a positive business environment and broad-based demand for our memory and storage solutions, particularly for cloud, enterprise and mobile markets. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were 58.4%, up 300 basis points from the prior quarter and up from 38.5% in the prior year. Our ability to drive a richer mix of high-value products, strong execution on our cost goals and favorable market conditions contributed to the gross margin expansion. Non-GAAP operating margin was 49%, up from 46% in the prior quarter and 25% in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $666 million, up approximately 9% from both the prior quarter and prior-year periods. The sequential increase is primarily attributed to expenses associated with shifting our portfolio to high-value solutions and accelerating our technology and product development. These expenses tend to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We're also beginning to incur the impact of solely funding the development of our fourth generation 3D NAND technology. We continue to manage operating expenses tightly and are generally only increasing operating expenses for developing and qualifying new products and technologies. Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit grew revenue to $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 15% from the prior quarter and 93% year-over-year. Cloud server revenues were up nearly 30% quarter-over-quarter as hyperscale customers continue to invest in data center infrastructure and broaden their service offerings. We also benefited from strong demand for graphics memory with cryptocurrency mining augmenting sales for gaming applications. Operating income increased to $2.3 billion or 63% of revenue, and reflects higher sales of our 1X nanometer DRAM solutions, along with tight supply conditions. The Mobile Business Unit achieved its highest ever revenue and operating income in the second quarter of $1.6 billion and $680 million, respectively. These results compare to $1.1 billion of revenue and $170 million of operating income for the same period last year. Our performance underscores our laser focus to meet customer's needs. The Embedded Business Unit reported revenue of $829 million in the second quarter, in line with last quarter, and up 41% year-over-year. The automotive business had a record quarter, driven by strong sales of ADAS and in-vehicle experience applications. We also saw an increase on our industrial business, driven by the growing industrial IoT markets, expanding factory automation, transportation and surveillance applications. Operating margins were 44% in the fiscal second quarter, expanding by 260 basis points compared with the first quarter. And finally, turning to the Storage Business Unit, revenue was $1.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year, supported by record revenue in SSDs. On a sequential basis, SD revenue declined by 9% with the strong growth in SSDs offset by a reduction in components revenue. The sequential revenue comparison was impacted by a mix shift within our NAND component sales, which I'll elaborate on momentarily. We're continuing to penetrate the SSD market and expand sales across each end-market: consumer, compliant -- client, enterprise and cloud. The growth is most pronounced in the enterprise and cloud SSD portion of the market. Our sales of these end markets were up nearly 30% quarter-over-quarter and more than 230% year-over-year. As we previously noted, product developments for 3D crosspoint solutions is now underway. During the second quarter, and over the next few quarters, we have incurred, and will likely to continue to incur, costs associated with production capacity underutilization in advance of volume ramp of these new 3D crosspoint products. These charges negatively impacted our SBU operating margins by approximately 500 basis points this quarter. Including these charges, second quarter operating margins were 20% compared with 29% in the fiscal first quarter and 7% in the prior-year period. Moving to performance by product line. DRAM represented 71% of total company revenue in the fiscal second quarter. DRAM revenue in the quarter was up 14% from the prior quarter and 76% year-over-year. Sequentially, shipment quantities increased in the mid-single-digit percentage range while ASPs increased in the low double-digit percentage range. DRAM non-GAAP gross margin was 66% in the second quarter, up 4 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 22 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Revenue from trade NAND represented 25% of overall company revenue in fiscal second quarter. Trade NAND revenue on the quarter was down 3% sequentially and up 28% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, shipment quantities increased in the low double-digit percentage range, while ASPs declined in the mid-teens percentage range. The sequential ASP decline in NAND increased in part due to a meaningful last time purchase of higher price MLC NAND in the fiscal first quarter. This is the mix shift in our SBU NAND components that I have referenced earlier. Trade NAND non-GAAP gross margins were at 47% in the second quarter, down 2 percentage points from the prior quarter but up 16 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. Gross margins for both SSDs and managed NAND solutions increased quarter-over-quarter, offsetting the declines in component margin. This change in mix illustrates the importance of shifting our sales towards high-value solutions. I'd like to take a moment to update you on the impact of U.S. tax reform on Micron. The onetime impact related to the taxation of accumulated offshore earnings and cash was largely neutral for the company. The impacts of this repatriation transition tax were largely offset by our accumulated tax losses and other tax credits. For the remainder of the year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain in the low to mid-single-digit percentage since we are not yet subject to certain provisions of the new tax code. For fiscal 2019 and beyond, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to settle in the low teens percentage range. Going forward, we'll benefit from having greater flexibility to access our worldwide cash deposits. Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.82, up 15% from the prior quarter and up over 200% from the prior year. As a result of our record performance, we generated $4.3 billion in cash from operations, which represented 59% of revenue. This compares to $1.8 billion in the year-ago period. Capital spending, net of third party contributions, was $2.1 billion, resulting in a very strong free cash flow adjusted for the third-party capital contributions of $2.2 billion or 30% of revenue. This compares to free cash flow of approximately $600 million in the year-ago period. As Sanjay mentioned earlier, we expect capital spending, net of third party contributions, to be at the upper end of our fiscal 2018 guided range of $7.5 billion, plus or minus 5%. As a result of the strong free cash flow, we ended the quarter with approximately $8.7 billion in cash, marketable investments and restricted cash. The face value of our debt increased approximately $200 million to $9.5 billion. A $300 million reduction in debt due to scheduled debt repayments was offset by a $500 million increase in debt at our MIFT -- IMFT joint venture. Since the first of our 3D crosspoint products are expected to launch in calendar 2019, we chose to defer funding for IMFT. Our partner is contractually able to make the funding on our behalf and designated a debt on IMFT's balance sheet. And that debt is then counted as part of our debt for the purpose of GAAP reporting. We still expect to be in a net cash positive position in the fourth quarter, and possibly sooner, depending on the extent and timing of any future convertible note redemptions. This net cash positive position remains a significant milestone in the ongoing strengthening of our financial foundation. We continue to evaluate additional opportunities to accelerate our deleveraging actions that will provide a high rate of return. This strong financial profile is the result of consistent execution and focus across the entire company. Now turning to the fiscal third quarter guidance. As Sanjay mentioned, we had a maintenance issue at one of our Taiwan DRAM fabs this week, which is impacting production. We expect this event to decrease our total revenue by approximately 2% in the third quarter, which we've accounted for in our guidance. Having said that, we continue to experience a strong demand environment and we, therefore, expect fiscal third quarter revenue to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, and non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 57% to 60%. We expect to see an increase in operating expenses, again, associated with product and technology qualifications, and the funding of our fourth generation 3D NAND technology, both of which primarily impact R&D. Considering these costs, non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $725 million, plus or minus $25 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Based on a share count of approximately 1.25 billion shares, these results should drive non-GAAP EPS of $2.83, plus or minus $0.07. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks. Thank you, Dave. Micron will be celebrating our 40th anniversary this fall. Innovation has always been a key cornerstone to our success, ensuring that our technologies and products quickly adapt to serve the world's growing appetite for faster data. As we look ahead, we remain focused on nurturing and fostering an accelerated pace of innovation, and I know our team is fired up and ready for the challenge. The opportunity to create a dramatic impact on the world around us is undeniable and I'm excited to be part of this team shaping that future. I'm looking forward to speaking with all of you at our analyst and investor event in May. You can expect us to provide more detail on how we see secular market trends, creating new opportunities for memory and high-performance storage, and why we believe Micron is well positioned to win. We will now open for questions.","Certainly. I think we are seeing the fastest growth through our DRAM memory at large-scale, in cloud computing and hyperscale data centers. And this is where high-performance memory is absolutely becoming essential along with fast storage is becoming essential for the trend such as AI, which are really driving new business models. Whether you go from education and training tailored toward the individual levels of coaching or training to the individuals or to millions of transactions processed realtime in the financial sector, to detect fraud or going to diagnosing and treating life-threatening diseases. Bottom line is we are barely starting with AI in cloud computing and data centers. And to realize the full impact of these solutions and to truly provide this new business model and services and applications to consumers and businesses alike, more and more data needs to be processed. It needs to be realtime analytics, and that requires more fast memory and more fast storage, that means flash as well as DRAM. So we are seeing tremendous growth. And if you look at trends, when we project that 2017, about 145 gigabytes per server going to about 350 gigabytes per server by 2021. Similarly, if you look at flash storage, 1.5 terabyte average in 2017 growing to something like 6 terabyte average with each server by 2021 timeframe. So these are massive, secular demand trends in the cloud computing and hyperscale for memory as well as for flash storage. Similarly, going to mobile, I talked about in my script that at Mobile World Congress, several new phone models were introduced that leverage 4K SDR capabilities that leverage AR and VR and even in our processors that are being introduced for mobile application that actually have the AI unit built into it. So just imagine how much data-intensive applications are now being run in order to provide users smooth experience. That then requires high performance and lot of memory. And you're starting to see now 6 gigabyte phones, 6 gigabyte of DRAM in the phone. So mobile is another large driver of DRAM memory. And of course, it is also a large driver with average capacities continuing to increase for flash as well. And then autonomous driving is barely starting. I mean, industry pundits are talking about robo taxis, intercepting the whole autonomous driving trend and maybe being introduced even in 2019-2020 kind of timeframe. And autonomous driving means, as I said in my remarks, data center on wheels. It's requiring more fast memory to again make all realtime decisions providing for the safe and comfortable and efficient driving experience. So these are really massive trends and these are secular in nature and I believe will continue to drive strong demand for DRAM in the years ahead. And of course, there are other ones, continuing average capacity increases in PCs for DRAM, with more gaming features and VR features. And of course, industrial 4.0 initiatives. I mean, these are all multiple mega markets for DRAM. And we are very well positioned with our product portfolio focusing on cost competitiveness, with our technology advancements as well as what I indicated, low-power DRAM solutions which are becoming increasingly important across a multitude of these applications. I mean, last year's flash was severely constrained and that did somewhat slow down the cash rate of SSD in client computing as well as slow down the march towards higher capacities of SSDs in notebook computers. And attach rates for SSDs in client computing, around 35% to 40% and maybe 40% in 2018, maybe going towards 50%. Over the next few years, this is expected to continue to go toward by 2020-2021 timeframe to 85%-plus attach rate for SSD. So again, this is a large growth driver for SSDs in client computing applications. And we are focused on, of course, expanding our portfolio of SSDs. We talked about significant progress of our SSDs across-the-board in client, enterprise as well as in the consumer market. And we look at opportunities to gain further share in all of these SSD markets in the future as we continue to execute on our product roadmap. We're not going to speculate on M&A matters here but we are very pleased with the portfolio of technologies and the initiatives we have with respect to continuing to advance our product solution. But of course, we do not rule out, in the future, leveraging M&A toward any growth initiatives. And of course, we'll always look for core capabilities to expand the market opportunities for Micron. And of course, we'll be focused on value in terms of any acquisition that we may entertain in the future, again, not speculating on anything at this point. And of course, always looking for ROI kind of opportunities. So we don't provide specifics on cost reductions but what I can tell you is that we are making very good progress on our technology. As we indicated, I mean, in our 1X DRAM technology, we have achieved the fastest ramp to mature yield in the history of the company. And similarly, our 64-layer technology, it has ramped to mature yields, rather well and we are continuing, of course, to do very well on our 20-nanometer DRAM technology that we use as well. So we are very pleased with our continuing progress on cost at the technology level, and continuing to focus on advancing our next-generation technology nodes and products. And of course, also very much focused nonmemory costs in our products such as SSD nonmemory costs. So making good progress and all of that is baked into our gross margin guidance that we have provided. So this nitrogen maintenance issue has not caused trapping of vapors. It has idled or slowed down production. As we said, it's impacting 2% to 3% of our this quarter's DRAM production output. And with respect to our expectation of our output growth for calendar year 2018, that remains in line with the industry estimate of 20%, and this effect is already included in that as well. Yes, that is correct that our production output is expected to grow in line with the industry and that is, of course, as a result of our excellent yield on 1X nanometer node as well as the 20-nanometer node. I think if you look at last few years and you look at Micron's revenue and you look at Micron's CapEx, you will see that Micron's CapEx, over the course of last few years, is in the low 30% range of the revenue over those last few years as well. So what we have said here today is fairly consistent with what actually has been the case at Micron over the course of the last few years. And in fact, if you look at the industry itself and you look at the revenue of the industry players and you look at the CapEx, over the course of last few years, you will see actually that, that average for the industry as well is in that same range also. So in terms of our own strategy for CapEx spend is absolutely focused on accelerating our technology transitions. So our CapEx is geared toward realizing DRAM and NAND technology transition toward more cost-effective advance technology nodes for our products. And it is not about capacity, wafer capacity production increase for us. So can you clarify the question to me? I didn't totally get the question. I'm sorry. So I think what we have to realize is that DRAM absolutely is essential to the experience in the business models that it enables. Whether it is the experience in mobile phones, I talked about all these experiences, AR, VR, 3D gaming, multitude of applications and users absolutely expecting seamless experience that requires -- such data-intensive applications require more DRAM. So it is essential. I mean, it's not like you can offer a model with a less DRAM in it, a high-end model with a less DRAM in it and expect that users will still have the same good experience. So DRAM capacity has really become a key enabler and essential element of mobile. And same, as I talked about earlier, for hyperscale data centers. When they look at what models that they can enable for their end customers, those are all being built on very data-intensive applications. I mean, imagine retailers, and a consumer goes into a retail store and the retailer already knows about what are the needs of their consumer. All of that requires realtime -- for retail, realtime AI applications, which means lot of data that has been processed fast, which means, again, it needs more DRAM memory. So it is actually, when you look at hyperscale data centers, it's not about the cost of DRAM anymore. I think the value that it enables to these cloud applications and hyperscalers is far in excess of any aspect of DRAM price per bit. So DRAM really has become an essential part. This is very different from any time in the past. And the best indicator of this is that DRAM pricing is strong and DRAM demand is strong right now. So let me go back to kind of the commentary and make sure it's clear. So in the second quarter, most of the increase we experienced was around qualifications of various technologies that kind of all came together, all in kind of the second quarter. And it kind of continues on into the third quarter. Those expenses kind of vary over time. And so this just happens to be kind of a couple of quarters in which that activity is pretty heavy. And so we're kind of experiencing kind of a lift in expenses, and I would expect that portion of it to kind of settle down. And when the next set of qualifications are required, it will come back up again. The other piece of the expenses really relate to our fourth-generation 3D NAND where, as we announced earlier, we're taking that on ourselves. We had -- about half of that hit us in the second quarter. We'll have the full quarter's effect in the third quarter, and that was about $20 million on a full quarter. So about $10 million lift in the second quarter and $20 million lift in the third quarter. So we are not going to comment on pricing trends in the industry but what I can tell you is that NAND industry does have certain aspect of its end market such as USB flash drive or imaging cards or retail. That tends to be more somewhat seasonal in the first calendar quarter. And as we go forward, that part changes. The most important thing to look at is that as more supply becomes available, it drives deeper penetration of SSDs in client devices as well as in -- gives an even stronger value proposition in enterprise and data center applications. So this is what we expect during the course of the year. And of course, average capacities of NAND in mobile phones, smartphones, continue to increase as well. And we are expanding our portfolio of multichip packages with DRAM and NAND, which is where Micron is uniquely well positioned to expand our opportunities and increase our shares with NAND flash and DRAM-based solutions in multichip packages as well as discrete NAND solutions such as the UFS that I talked about that are in the stages of qualification with our customers. So we look ahead at the year with strong demand drivers for NAND in the industry and growing opportunities for our NAND business for the remainder of the year, calendar year here. And very focused on execution of all our new product introductions and qualifications with our customers because those will ultimately drive our success toward high-value solutions as part of mix of NAND revenue. Yes, for this calendar year, for data center, absolutely, NAND bit consumption in data center is expected to be 50%, in the range of 50% or higher. Basically, a data center is where demand will grow faster than the average of the industry. Keep in mind, same thing for client SSDs as well. So let me be clear that we are very excited about the market opportunities for DRAM and NAND. All the things that we have been talking about so far over the course of the last 45 minutes here. And of course, our strategy is to continue to strengthen our competitive -- cost competitiveness as well as increase the mix of high-value solutions in our revenue. And by high-value solutions in our revenue, we mean products such as SSDs as well as managed NAND solution because we have both DRAM and NAND and that gives us a unique opportunity to provide management solutions for today's smartphones that are needing more and more of such solutions. So we are absolutely focused on leveraging our core capabilities to drive cost reductions, catch up on the DRAM cost with the rest of the competition and in the NAND, strengthen our portfolio of these high-value solutions. And I have no doubt that there is -- nobody is taking their eye off the ball and we have relentless focus on strengthening the execution engine of the company and tremendous opportunity ahead in that regards for us. It's already implied through the strong results we have demonstrated so far but there is even greater opportunity ahead of us. So what we introduced recently is a 64-layer bit TLC SATA SSD. And as we have said before, QLC is certainly an exciting opportunity for Micron in the years ahead, and QLC is in the development stages. And it is not a 2018 phenomena. I mean, that is something that's more like 2019 opportunity, starting in 2019 timeframe. We don't get into cost discussions. And our focus, of course, is to develop QLC solutions that will be, in the future, going toward applications that are very read intensive and somewhat balanced in terms of more write applications. And of course, our goal would be to drive these -- build value in these solutions, especially going toward high-capacity aspects of the storage market, build value in these solutions so that we can be selling them in a profitable fashion and bringing strong value to our customers as well. I'm not going to get into pricing or speculate of the pricing for QLC. We're not seeing any despeccing. If anything, again, given the nature of the application, the average capacity requirements continue to go up in all end markets arena. We have talked about our 1Z technology node in DRAM and our engineers are working on that. And engineers, of course, always continue to look at opportunities for further scaling. And concurrently, we are working on other advanced technologies of the future as well. There is no letter in the alphabet after Z. Thank you. We'll take you up on your suggestion. We don't give that breakdown. So 3D crosspoint products are expected to come out in -- sometime in calendar year 2019. We will have -- sometimes we'll have underloading charges. It's possible that our partner might take some of the -- of those wafers so that would obviously help on the underutilization. Of course, as we start to release those products, about late 2018, we'll start to build some of those wafers and that will help out on the underutilizations as well. And I just want to comment on your earlier question regarding SSD. Of course, we don't provide the specifics but clearly, SSD is growing fast and it's increasingly large portion of our revenue. And very pleased with the progress that we have made in increasing the mix of SSD in our portfolio.","I was wondering, Sanjay, if you could talk a little bit about the changes in the DRAM industry that you've seen over the past year or so. I think in the past, you had mentioned that memory is becoming a strategic differentiator for high-performance computing. I was wondering if you can maybe elaborate on what specific end markets or behavior patterns that have been changing with some of your main customers in terms of how they consume memory. That's very helpful, Sanjay. As my follow-up, your SSD revenue was up 80% year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about the attach rate for client SSD specifically? Last year, they were put on a temporary pause because of tightness of supply. I was wondering if you could talk a little about that now that we're about a quarter into this year? This is [Wayne Loeb] on the line for Chris Danely. My question is when you talk about your plans for acquisitions, what would be the criteria that would make you buy something? And how does M&A fit into your plan in the context of Micron wanting to be a NAND solution provider? As a follow-up question, can you talk about what Micron's projected cost reductions are for NAND and DRAM this year? First question, I hope you can detail a little bit more about that nitrogen issue you mentioned. Did you have to scrap wafers or just idle production? And can you help us reconcile the comment about a little bit less DRAM output for next quarter with the now full year guidance about growing in line with the industry compared to last quarter. I think, Micron was going to grow slightly before -- definitely below, excuse me. Is it fair to assume a better 1X nanometer yield? Is that how Micron is now growing in line with the industry for the full year despite this nitrogen issue? Okay. And then one other question for me, if I could. Sanjay, you commented about having a CapEx-to-sales target in the low 30% range. I don't want to parse words too closely, I think it was about 30% as of the last Analyst Day. But the strategy for Micron, as I understood it, had been that the company is trying to keep its net DRAM wafer starts flat and there's a lot of costs associated with getting to these new nodes because of all the extra factory space that you need and need for new clean rooms. Just given your comments about CapEx coming in toward the higher end of the range this year and the comments about that ratio, is there any change about the strategy of Micron, how it's thinking about CapEx? And really just enabling -- getting to those next nodes which are getting more expensive? Or is there a change we need to be thinking about in terms of how Micron is thinking about managing its net wafer starts in DRAM? Dave, welcome to the team. I have 2 questions, please. My first question is on DRAM demand. We all know that DRAM is more inelastic than NAND but I was curious, what are some signs that you look for to assess if you are beginning to see demand destruction in DRAM demand from higher ASPs, particularly in mobile and PC environments that are more sensitive to price than hyperscale environments? I have a follow-up, please. Yes, I'm just curious how should we assess the potential demand destruction in DRAM demand from higher ASPs in mobile and PC environments over the next few quarters, if there were to be an issue? That's helpful. As my follow-up, I was hoping you could elaborate on your comments for OpEx as we think about the trajectory of spending for the next few quarters. Specifically, do you plan on reinvesting the savings you expect to achieve from Micron and Elpida coming together for the first time on 1X development? And how should we think about the timing of any planned prequalification expenses for maybe 1X DRAM or QLC 3D NAND deployment when we make assumptions for OpEx for the balance of 2018? Given the continued strong demand that you see in data center, how should we look at the initial supply/demand outlook in NAND flash for the second half of calendar '18? Should we expect the pricing to stabilize? Any commentary based on trends that you see currently continuing for the rest of the year? Okay. That's useful. And then as a quick follow-up, is it fair to assume that the high double-digit growth rate in better demand for NAND in data center is something that is possible again for this calendar year? Sanjay, I have a follow-up. You and others in the memory industry have been discussing opportunities in moving up the stack. At the same time, some of your enterprise customers are also trying to navigate their way and move up the stack. And I'm just wondering, what's wrong with keeping the business as is? Your NAND gross margin is in the 45% to 50%; DRAM gross margin is in the 65% to 70%, and assuming that the industry is rational and we can't avoid excess capacity, why not just focus on making the most cost-effective DRAM and bit and capitalize on the margin profile? And I have a follow-up. In terms of costs, you recently introduced a QLC 64-layer 3D NAND SATA SSD. Is there any way you can either quantify or qualitatively discuss the cost per gigabyte that this particular product offers you? And how we should think about its ability, due to lowest cost, to penetrate and displace existing technologies? But should we assume that this offers you, perhaps, I'm just going to give you a number, could it still offer a customer less than $0.20 per gigabyte of cost? Sanjay, if you can just clarify, I think somebody asked the question before but I'll just make it more concise. Are you seeing any despeccing in DRAM or NAND market? And I have a follow-up. Okay. And then a follow-up, more of a longer-term or midterm question. After 1Y in the DRAM world, how many more node transitions or half transitions do you expect you and the industry to have before you hit a wall, if you will? Okay. But there's no letter after 1Z at this point? You can go to 1Zb or you can add a plus, plus or plus, plus, plus. Just on the NAND side, I was wondering what percent of your NAND was SSDs? I know you mentioned it grew 80% year-on-year and seeing good traction enterprise. Got it. And I know you talked about 3D crosspoint. There's a bit drag on the margins. When do you start to see the drag go away? And I was just wondering, as you look at that ramp by the end of -- by year-end, what proportion do you think that would be of your NAND? Thanks, Jonathan. As always, we appreciate your interest and support for Micron. I'd remind you that a copy of the prepared remarks as well as a webcast replay can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website later this afternoon. Thank you.

Good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter results contributed to a year of unprecedented success for the company. With record profitability and revenue over $30 billion, Micron ended fiscal 2018 as the second largest semiconductor company in the U.S. The new Micron is undergoing a fundamental transformation, driven by our 34,000-plus employees around the world, whom I would like to thank for their intense focus on our key priorities. Our markets are propelled by diversified secular growth trends, our industry is more rational and the Micron team is executing well against the company's strategy. Over the last 12 months, we have sharpened our focus on improving our cost structure and on increasing the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio, all of which position us well for the future. Our technology road map and manufacturing execution is driving strong cost reductions for the company. Over the last year, we have increased production DRAM bits per wafer at a higher rate than the industry, reducing the cost gap with competitors. We are on track to achieve total bit output crossover on 1X nanometer DRAM in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and have already achieved bit shipment crossover for 1X nanometer in the client and graphics markets in the fourth quarter. We expect 1Y nanometer sales to commence before the end of calendar 2019, with meaningful production increases beginning in the fiscal third quarter as we recently announced new cleanroom space comes online at our Hiroshima facility. We are also making good progress on our 1Z nanometer technology development. In NAND, cost reductions and mix improvements have helped us deliver sequential gross margin expansion even as pricing declined in the industry. At this time last year, our bit output share was meaningfully below our wafer market share. Over the last 12 months, through the strong execution of our 64-layer ramp and a higher mix of TLC, we have reversed this trend and now have our bit share ahead of our wafer share. We remain on track to move 96-layer NAND into production this calendar year and will continue to ramp it next year, which should provide us with solid cost reductions in fiscal 2019. We have already commercialized CMOS Under the Array, QLC and array stacking on 3D NAND, while most competitors still have these challenges ahead of them. Our technology leadership positions us well for the year ahead, and we are pleased with the headway we are making on our fourth-generation 3D NAND technology, which uses a replacement gate architecture. We also made excellent progress increasing our mix of higher value-added solutions, delivering record revenue in our SSD and multichip package products this quarter. Our enterprise and cloud SSD quarterly revenues more than doubled year-over-year as we strengthened our position in SATA SSDs. A third-party research firm recently recognized Micron as the #1 market share leader in enterprise SATA. We achieved well over $2 billion in annual SSD revenue in fiscal 2018. Our first-generation NVMe SSD is in the final stages of product development. Looking ahead, we are focused on introducing new NVMe SSDs over the course of the next several quarters. Consumer and client NVMe SSDs will come first, and then late in calendar 2019, cloud and enterprise NVMe drives. As the market rapidly shifts to NVMe, 2019 will be a year of transition for us, following solid SSD share gains in 2018, and we expect to start growing SSD share again in 2020 with a fuller product portfolio. We also look forward to leveraging our market advantage with QLC SSDs in 2019 and beyond. Fiscal Q4 saw a continuation of our stellar performance in managed NAND growth, with MCP revenues growing 21% sequentially. MCPs are used in the vast majority of smartphones, and we have robust demand from customers for these products. We are focused on growing MCP revenues and are introducing new differentiated products to enhance our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our new 128-gigabyte NAND plus 4-gigabyte DRAM MCP ramped revenue faster than any other managed NAND product in our history, demonstrating our strong execution as well as the market demand for high-capacity, high-value MCPs for flagship smartphones. We are pleased with our progress and believe we still have a lot of room to grow in this market over the coming year. Now turning to highlights by market. More than 1/3 of our total revenues in fiscal 2018 were from data center and graphics. Our annual revenues in these markets have more than doubled year-over-year. We are confident about the long-term demand growth in this market as AI and big data analytics continue to create new value for end customers. Our collaboration with customers in these markets is deep, and we work closely with them to bring new technologies to market. For example, in Q4, we started shipping a new custom persistent memory solution to a large hyperscale company. In graphics, NVIDIA chose us the lead GDDR6 partner for their GeForce RTX products, and we expect to see strong growth in our GDDR6 shipments in fiscal 2019. We are also collaborating with customers on 3D XPoint solutions and expect to start sampling products in late calendar 2019. Markets requiring our long life cycle products make up more than 15% of our revenues. We win in these markets on high-quality, deep partnerships, committed long-term support and the breadth of our DRAM, NAND and NOR product portfolio. These businesses in our portfolio typically show higher stability in revenues, profitability and cash flows and are supported by secular growth drivers such as autonomous driving, networking, IoT and industrial automation. Our automotive business had record revenues in the quarter. We have a strong design win pipeline for automotive products, with a lifetime value of several billion dollars. To support our long-term growth in these markets, we recently announced a multiyear $3 billion investment to expand our fab in Manassas, Virginia over the next decade. This site will be a world-class center of excellence for developing and manufacturing these long life cycle solutions. Turning to mobile. The market continues to grow, driven by content increases for DRAM and NAND across all frontiers. We shipped our first high-performance UFS-managed NAND products in the fourth quarter and expect this to be a growth area for us in fiscal 2019. We delivered record results in mobile, with revenues up 8% sequentially, driven by strength in NAND as we grew NAND bits 80% quarter-on-quarter. DRAM and NAND content will continue to grow in mobile devices in fiscal 2019, driven by customer preferences and the need to support new camera and video features utilizing machine learning. Looking at the industry broadly, calendar 2018 has been a phenomenal year so far, with a total DRAM and NAND TAM on track to reach record highs and total industry revenues forecasted to grow 29% year-over-year to $168 billion. As we discussed at our Investor Day event, we expect industry cyclicality to be more dampened than in the past as industry supply growth from nodes transitions slows structurally and supply growth requires higher levels of CapEx. In addition, we continue to see robust diversified demand drivers and are confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Turning to bit growth. In DRAM, we see the calendar 2018 industry bit output growth tracking slightly above 20%, with Micron growing in line with the industry. NAND industry bit output growth is tracking close to 45% in calendar 2018, and we expect to grow roughly in line with the industry. Looking ahead to calendar 2019, we plan to grow DRAM bits in line with estimated industry growth of approximately 20% and plan to grow NAND bits somewhat above our expectation of industry growth of 35% to 40%. In fiscal 2019, we expect that DRAM profitability will remain strong as the market continues to benefit from long-term structural growth drivers and from structurally slowing supply growth. Turning to NAND. We have seen an acceleration in supply growth in calendar 2018, driven by the ramp of highly efficient 64-layer 3D NAND across the industry. Looking ahead, we expect a moderation in supply growth beginning in the first half of calendar 2019 as the industry transitions to more challenging 96-layer designs, which provide less benefit node over node. We also expect higher demand due to elasticity, resulting in higher SSD adoption and increasing average capacities across multiple end markets. In our fiscal first quarter, we see some impact to our client compute customers due to a shortage of CPUs. In addition, there is some limited inventory adjustment underway at a few customers, but their end customer demand remains solid. Turning to CapEx. Dave will provide more details, but I want to emphasize that our fiscal 2019 CapEx plans are consistent with our strategy to focus on technology transitions while maintaining existing wafer capacity. As we have highlighted previously, future technology transitions in NAND and DRAM require substantially more cleanroom space than prior nodes. As a result, our fiscal 2019 CapEx related to manufacturing facility construction and facility upgrades is increasing by nearly $2 billion year-over-year, primarily due to our previously announced NAND and DRAM cleanroom expansions. This investment will provide us the flexibility to better manage our manufacturing operations and drive the manufacturing ramp of new technologies in a timely manner. As I reflect on the tremendous progress we have made improving our competitive position this year and the amazing opportunities that drive our industry, I'm very excited about Micron's future. Against this backdrop, we certainly view our stock as being undervalued at current prices and are aggressively implementing our stock buyback program. We will continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet and use strong free cash flow to support over $10 billion buyback and assess opportunities to accelerate the time line for its completion. With that, I will pass this over to Dave. Thank you, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. Micron continues to perform exceptionally well and delivered strong financial results in the fourth quarter. We set new records for revenue, gross margin, free cash flow and earnings per share. In addition, we continue to strengthen our financial foundation, achieving our highest-ever net cash position. Total fiscal fourth quarter revenue was $8.4 billion, up 8% from fiscal third quarter and 38% from the prior year. For fiscal 2018, total revenue was $30.4 billion, up 50% from fiscal 2017. Gross margins for the quarter expanded to a record 61%, up approximately 50 basis points from the prior quarter and up from 51% in the prior year. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we saw the benefit of strong execution on technology transitions for both DRAM and NAND. This strong execution resulted in a significant sequential cost decline, which drove expanded gross margins in both DRAM and NAND. For fiscal 2018, gross margins were 59%, up from 43% in fiscal 2017. Operating expenses came in at $740 million, approximately flat from fiscal third quarter 2018. As previously communicated, moving forward, we expect to increase our investments in R&D for fiscal 2019 as we add resources to expand our portfolio of new high-value solutions and phase out partner contributions for technology development. Our record revenue and gross margin performance drove strong profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter, and operating income grew to $4.4 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This compares with operating margins of 52% in fiscal third quarter and 41% in the year-ago period. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. We achieved record revenue for the compute and networking business unit of $4.4 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, up 9% from the prior quarter and 53% year-over-year. Growth trends were strong in cloud and graphics, which almost doubled year-on-year. Fiscal fourth quarter operating income in CNBU was up 11% sequentially to $2.9 billion or 67% of revenue. Revenues for the Mobile Business Unit increased to a record $1.9 billion, up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 60% year-over-year. Sequential growth was primarily led by multichip packages and discrete/managed NAND. Fiscal fourth quarter operating income increased 14% quarter-over-quarter to a record $979 million or 52% of revenue. The Embedded Business Unit continues to deliver solid results, with record revenue of $923 million, up 3% versus fiscal third quarter and up 12% year-over-year. Sequential growth was driven by the automotive and industrial markets. Fiscal fourth quarter operating income in EBU was $382 million or 41% of revenue. And finally, turning to the Storage Business Unit. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year. We set a record for overall SSD revenues, driven by our continued success in the SATA SSD market. Fiscal fourth quarter operating income in SBU was $157 million or 13% of revenue, which included the impact from the underutilization charges related to 3D XPoint. And now, moving to performance by product line. DRAM represented 70% of total company revenue in fiscal fourth quarter. DRAM revenue was up 7% from the prior quarter and 47% year-over-year as Micron executed well in a robust market environment. On a blended basis, ASPs were flat to the prior quarter, while shipment quantities were up mid to upper single digits percent. Gross margins for DRAM were 71%, up from 69% in the prior quarter as cost benefited from the ramp of our 1X nanometer technology. Trade NAND revenue represented 26% of total company revenue in fiscal fourth quarter. Trade NAND revenue was up 15% quarter-over-quarter and 21% year-over-year, driven by strong sequential growth in managed NAND products. Our overall NAND ASP decreased in the mid-teens percentage range, and shipment quantities increased in the mid-30 percentage range compared to the prior quarter. Trade NAND gross margins were 48%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter and up 720 basis points from the year-ago quarter, driven by robust cost reductions and product mix improvements. Our solid execution and healthy industry environment led to a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.53, up 12% from the prior quarter and 75% from the prior year. For the full fiscal 2018, we achieved net income of $14.7 billion or $11.95 per share compared with $5.6 billion or $4.96 per share for fiscal 2017. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we generated a record $5.2 billion in cash from operations, representing 61% of revenue. Micron has historically shown strong cash flows from operations, even in our most difficult years, and our current cash flow levels are now structurally higher as we have made significant improvements on our underlying cost competitiveness and enhanced our product mix. Capital spending net of third-party contributions was $2.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter and $8.2 billion for the fiscal year. While our annual capital spending was well below our CapEx model of low 30s as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2018, we do plan to increase our CapEx as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2019. We currently expect our fiscal 2019 CapEx, net of partner contributions, to be in the range of $10.5 billion, plus or minus 5%. Our investments will continue to be focused on technology transitions for DRAM and NAND while maintaining flat wafer capacity. We expect that about 25% of our capital spending will be associated with facilities expansions and facilities upgrades needed for successful technology transitions. These expansion and upgrade projects are underway, and as a result, CapEx will be more weighted towards the first half of the fiscal year. Our strategy is to be flexible and disciplined regarding our CapEx, and we will be responsive to market conditions. As an example, we cut back our fab equipment CapEx for NAND in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 levels. In the fourth quarter, our free cash flow was $3.1 billion, up $900 million from the third quarter and up nearly $1.4 billion from the prior year period. Free cash flow for the full fiscal year was $9.2 billion compared to $3.3 billion last fiscal year. We ended the fiscal year in a record net cash position of $2.7 billion, with approximately $7.4 billion in cash, marketable investments and restricted cash, and $4.6 billion in debt. During the fiscal year, we used $9.4 billion for the repurchase or prepayment of debt and redemptions of converts and reduced our debt position by $6.5 billion. In the fiscal fourth quarter alone, we reduced our debt position by approximately $2.7 billion, including the repayment of $2 billion of Taiwan secured debt. Combining the debt and equity components, we spent about $1.3 billion for redeemed convertible notes during the fiscal fourth quarter. Our convert redemption in fiscal third and fourth quarter have lowered the share count in the first quarter by approximately 31 million or 2.5% from what it would have been had the converts not been redeemed. Prior to turning to our outlook, I wanted to provide some context for our fiscal first quarter guidance. As Sanjay indicated, our markets remain healthy and demand from our customers is strong, but we are seeing some impact of CPU shortages in the client compute market and limited inventory adjustments at select customers. We expect gross margins to remain very healthy in the fiscal first quarter, although lower than fourth quarter levels, and our gross margins will also be impacted in the near term by the announced 10% tariff on $200 billion of imports from China, which will go into effect on September 24. We are working to gradually mitigate most of the impact from these tariffs over the next 3 to 4 quarters. Our fiscal 2019 tax rate should increase to approximately 12% versus 2.8% in fiscal 2018, with the new U.S. corporate tax rules enacted this year. With the revenue, gross margin and tax factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the first fiscal quarter is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion; gross margins to be in the range of 57% to 60%; operating expenses are expected to be $750 million, plus or minus $25 million; and based on share count of approximately 1.2 billion fully diluted shares, we expect earnings per share to be $2.95, plus or minus $0.07. Now let me take a moment to provide an update on our share repurchase program. I'm pleased to report that our buyback has been in effect since the beginning of September. And for the fiscal first quarter, we are committed to spend at least $1.5 billion in programmatic repurchases, with an additional amount allocated for opportunistic repurchases. Beyond the first fiscal quarter, we expect to be active buyers of our stock by repurchasing Micron shares regularly. We are committed to deploying at least 50% of our ongoing free cash flow towards our $10 billion buyback program, and as Sanjay mentioned, we are assessing an accelerated rate of completion of this program. The total buyback program of $10 billion represents approximately 19% of the current equity value. Before I turn the call back over to Sanjay, I'd like to discuss an update to our disclosures. As we typically do this time of year, we review the financial information we disclose to make sure that we are appropriately balancing the needs of investors to make an informed investment decision with a desire to keep confidential as much proprietary information as possible. In doing so, we also review information disclosed by competitors. As a result, beginning in the fiscal first quarter, we will no longer be disclosing gross margins by our DRAM and NAND product categories. We view this information as sensitive and proprietary. To help investors understand the drivers of our corporate gross margins, we will provide color on factors affecting gross margins. We will continue to provide revenue and operating margin information by segment in our quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Sanjay for concluding remarks. Thank you, Dave. I'm proud of the Micron's teams' execution in fiscal 2018. In October, we will celebrate the 40th anniversary of Micron's founding. Our proven track record in delivering technology and design innovation and building close partnerships with a broad range of customers has laid a solid foundation. We are now driving a culture of agility, efficiency and speed and executing on product level innovations in high-value solutions. This transformation to the new Micron continues to build strong momentum. I'm really excited about our future, and the best is yet to come. We will now open for questions.","Okay, yes, sure. So let me get -- take the first one. Let's start with -- so on the magnitude side, we're not going to go into necessarily the details, all the details in a granular fashion. Suffice it to say that they both had an impact in terms of the guidance of $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion They're a big driver of obviously why we guided in that direction. I don't know exactly how long the CPU shortage will last. I think on the inventory correction side, it will be a couple of quarters before inventory gets reduced. And I will just add that [with the CPU] shortages, we expect it to be short term. It's possible that it goes beyond Q1 as well. As we said, we have gained substantial shares in SSDs, primarily based on SATA SSDs over the course of 2018, our fiscal 2018. And we are very pleased with the progress we have made there. And, of course, market is shifting towards NVMe SSDs, and that's where the future growth opportunity lies. And we have been working on our NVMe SSD solution. We plan to introduce our first NVMe solutions later this year, and then we will be ramping, as we said, in the client and consumer space, bringing new products into the market in calendar year 2019 and bringing, later on, enterprise and cloud, NVMe SSDs later in the year, in the 2019 year. So our NVMe SSDs will be ramping up gradually over the course of 2019. Of course, we will continue to maintain a solid share position with SATA SSDs. Overall, I expect that our total share in SSDs will continue to be flattish in 2019 time frame, and we expect to resume share growth from [a] 2020 time frame as we complete our NVMe SSD portfolio. And by completing NVMe SSD portfolio, I mean, complete the development of SSDs, get them qualified with our customers and ramp them into production. So we are very confident about the long-term opportunity for us in SSDs, leveraging our low-cost 64 layers NAND as well as our 96-layer NAND solutions over the course of next few quarters. I think most important to understand is the end market demand trends for DRAM as well as NAND continue to be strong. I mean, when you look at data center and cloud applications, AI is in the very, very early innings. And the whole cloud growth is in the very early innings as well. We see the DRAM requirements in enterprise and cloud data center application to be growing much faster than the total average DRAM industry demand growth, CAGR over course of few years of about 30%. Similarly, in mobile applications, DRAM is growing nicely as well, as machine learning kind of features, as facial recognition, et cetera, get implemented in these forms. We are already starting to see 6 to 8 gigabyte, even 10 gigabyte, coming in smart -- high-end smartphones now, and these are not too far -- and then you even see 12 gigabyte in smartphones. And similarly, on the NAND front, when you look at average capacities increasing in smartphones, you are seeing now 512-gigabyte smartphones being offered, and again, days of terabyte smartphones are not far away. And certainly, with elasticity in NAND, average capacities in client computing applications as well as mobile devices will increase as well as attach rate of SSDs will increase. So this is important. When you look at these demand trends, we feel very confident about the long-term trajectory. In 1 or 2 quarters here or there, there can certainly be ebb and flow in terms of demand or supply in the industry, but the long-term trend is positive. And specific to our CapEx, I'll just point out here that we are being very prudent, very disciplined in managing our CapEx, absolutely focused on profitability and ROI. We had mentioned that our CapEx on cleanroom construction and facility upgrades is increasing by $2 billion compared to last year. And Dave mentioned that it represents about 25% of our total CapEx guidance that we provided. And just as an example of our discipline on CapEx management in NAND, in terms of equipment CapEx for 2019, our fiscal year 2019 versus 2018, we have -- we are actually reducing the CapEx fiscal year 2019 versus 2018. So we are extremely focused on technology conversions, technology transitions because they are the best way for us to achieve cost competitiveness as well as ROI on our investments. We are not adding the wafer starts, where some other competitors may have thought about those in the industry. So I think with respect to the inventory question that you have, it's very important to understand that we are not talking about debt inventory adjustment in any particular segment. This is with few customers. It is a customer-specific inventory adjustment that we discuss here. And, of course, we cannot call out those customers on this call. And with respect to pricing, of course, we do not forecast pricing. But you look at our F Q4 results, our DRAM pricing was flat, and 71% gross margin, record gross margin, extremely healthy. Industry environment, we see going forward as well for DRAM. As I talked about, the demand drivers are vibrant for DRAM, they are diversified and they are secular in nature, and DRAM solutions are really bringing great value to the AI-driven kind of applications where they're really essential to that trend. And you have to keep in mind that the supply growth is slowing down as well, given the increased technology complexities and greater CapEx that is required to implement the technology transition. So overall, we continue to see healthy DRAM industry fundamentals. On the NAND side, as I mentioned, this year, calendar 2018, we see NAND supply output growth at approximately 45%, and this, as you know, has been there because the industry, over the course of last several months, has gone through a major transition from 2D NAND to 3D NAND with a 64 layer. And the industry at this point is already on 3D transition in terms of total bits on a calendar year basis at about 75% level. So going forward on NAND as well, as you look at transition in the future to 96 layer, that will have the same kind of [consideration] that increase technology complexity and reduced bit gain per wafer from 64- to 96-layer transition. So we see moderation in the industry supply aspect in the first half of 2019. Yes. So, first of all, the gross margin guidance was 57% to 60%. So, of course, if we hit the higher end of that range, we will be 140 basis points down. Clearly, tariffs are impacting us, probably to the tune of 50 to 100 basis points. And as we talked about, we're working on steps to mitigate that. That obviously takes some time. We have to do some things operationally to get ourselves in a place where it isn't as impactful. And so it will be a quarter or 2 probably before we start to see some benefit from the improvement there. So that was certainly a factor on the gross margin side. I would say, in general, the market for DRAM is healthy. The market for NAND is well supplied. So we built in various expectations, depending on kind of how things play out from a revenue perspective, and that certainly drives some of the gross margin adjustments as well. But suffice it to say, if we look at this from a year-over-year comparison, gross margins, I think, in the first quarter of 2018 were 55.4%, if I'm not mistaken. So we'll be above, on a year-over-year basis, if we hit within the range of what we expect, anywhere from 160 to 460 basis points. So let me take that. In terms of demand elasticity, we are certainly seeing that. I think in smartphones, you do see a move to higher capacities. I referred to that in my previous comment in response to the previous question. In SSDs, which is currently [limited] to consumer and channels-related SSDs, with the benefit of lower-priced NAND, certainly, you see -- you are starting to see -- there's always some lag. Average capacity increases in those channels as well. So overall, NAND should definitely continue to benefit from price elasticity. So we are not going to provide full year guidance on the cost side for fiscal year 2019, but I will tell you that we believe we are in very good position with respect to continuing to execute on our technology and manufacturing road map and realizing cost reduction. Of course, as we have said before, when you go from 1 technology node to the other technology node, you achieve less bits per wafer gain, and that impacts, of course, the cost reduction capability from 1 node to the next node. And again, the laws of physics are the same everywhere, and this is common across the industry, as we discussed at our Investor Day. So 1Y technology in mature years will provide less cost reduction than 1X technology provided over the 20-nanometer. Nonetheless, our position will be good in terms of cost reduction. Things that we discussed at Investor Day, we feel very good about our ongoing march toward strengthening our cost competitiveness. And, of course, in NAND, we are in very good position with the lowest-cost technology in the industry. So let me just point out that in 2018, we were well below the industry in terms of overall CapEx. And overall, we definitely are absolutely focused on technology transitions with respect to our CapEx, and we believe we have, really, a prudent disciplined focus, as I said before, in terms of addressing our CapEx toward equipments, targeting it toward technology transition and bit growth coming from the technology transition. We have mentioned that calendar year '19, we see our supply bit growth in line with the industry on DRAM side, which we expect to be approximately 20%. And in NAND, we have said that we expect our fiscal year 2019 supply output bit growth to be -- industry to be in the range of 35% to 40% and for us to be somewhat higher. And I would say, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we do react to changes in our view, and we did reduce our CapEx plans for NAND in fiscal 2019. So we are able to make adjustments as we see changes. Yes. And, of course, we retain some flexibility in terms of managing this on an ongoing basis as well. So at this point, we are not providing specifics on 96-layer and how much you gain per wafer, but I think some of it can be obvious as well. You are going from 64-layer to 96 layers. And future generation beyond 96-layer will tend to have, again, reduced bit gain per wafer. All of that is obviously -- along with the assumptions of industry ramp of 96-layer, is baked into our overall guidance of fiscal year -- calendar year '19 NAND bit growth of 35% to 40%. It's slowing down because, again, 64-layer to 96-layer will give you less gain. So in 2018, you saw a onetime increase in NAND bit growth, given that the industry went from 2D to 3D transition with 64-layer. Going forward, it will revert back to the same curve of less and less bit gain and, of course, more CapEx requirements with each successive technology transition. So in my prepared remarks, I did mention about QLC, and we have -- we are the first ones to introduce QLC SSDs in the industry, very proud of Micron's ability and execution in that area and very proud of our team to be able to do that. And we have just begun with certain set of limited customers taking that QLC SATA SSD product to the market. This will be a growing revenue for us within SSD next year. Although it will remain relatively small, it will initially be, of course, in the SATA QLC solutions. As in the past, when you went through MLC transitions in the NAND industry or you went through the TLC transitions in the NAND industry, those transitions occurred over the course of few years, and we similarly expect the QLC transition to be happening gradually over the course of next few years, although we will start realizing revenue from QLC SSDs starting now, but -- then continuing to increase it modestly in calendar 2019 as well. And, of course, focusing on it in the SSD space. So as I said before, this is not limited to any particular segment. It is more specific customer consideration. And given the kind of pricing that had existed in the DRAM market, certain customers have certain inventory levels that -- in a certain inventory strategy that they were pursuing. And those customers have decided to adjust their inventory levels. So that's what we refer to in our remarks. In terms of the end market demand for those customers and end market demand for DRAM application, that continues to be solid. It's just an inventory adjustment approach of some of our customers. I mean, absolutely, we will continue to increase our high-value solutions mix, which means SSDs as well as managed NAND solutions for mobile application, including discrete managed NAND solutions as well as multichip packages, where, of course, we have a significant benefit because we have both DRAM and NAND. So absolutely, this is part of our strategy. We will absolutely continue to increase our mix of SSD and managed NAND solutions, high-value solutions. Just want to remind you that we had shared at the Investor Day that in fiscal year '17, we had about 40% of NAND revenue coming from our high-value solution, that means SSDs and managed NAND solutions. And in fiscal year '18, we increased that to a little over 60%. In fact, in fiscal Q4, our managed NAND and SSD mix, the high-value solutions mix in NAND is over 2/3. So this just goes to show you that we are absolutely working toward our goal that we had shared with you at the Investor Day, that by 2021, we will have 80% of our NAND revenue in terms of -- actually, in terms of managed NAND solutions. So this is going really well for us, and it, of course, provides us the benefits in terms of profitability as well. So, certainly, I think when you look at the data center, the total CapEx increases particularly in the hyperscale application, a lot of that CapEx, (inaudible) go toward server and memory and storage application. But that certainly is an indication of the continuing year-over-year growth (inaudible) certainly an indication of [keeping] opportunity. But again, I will point out that we are in very early innings there. And this is going to be a multi-year growth opportunity for us. And we are actually focused on working closely with the customers in this space. And through those discussions, we had good visibility from them in terms of our opportunity for the future. So we feel very good about our growth opportunities in this part of the segment here. So I think one of the things I will share with you is that if you look at the DRAM demand growth projections in the cloud and enterprise data center space, you will see that, that CAGR over a few years is 30%, and that is higher than the expected DRAM overall industry supply bit growth of 20%. So this is one of the fastest growth areas where DRAM, along with NAND, really bring a lot of value to those customers. I think at our Investor Day, we had taken you through the details of how AI-driven applications are requiring 6x more DRAM per server and 2x more SSDs per server. So I think you have to look at all of these trends. There is no one particular trend that I can point to. You -- in this regard, of course, you have to look at the cloud CapEx. You have to look at the average capacity increases that are taking place on the DRAM side as well as for the NAND side in cloud applications, the server attach rates. The CPUs that are going into the servers have more memory channels that's enabling more DRAM growth per server content in the data center application. So there are many of these things that all absolutely are pointing to strong demand drivers. And just to end the comment here, I would point out that our end market applications are well diversified in DRAM. Of course, cloud and data center is 1 strong growth area for us, but mobile, automotive, industrial, IoT, all of these are also growth applications. For example, in automotive and industrial, we have #1 market share, and that's a very stable kind of market opportunity. And we are doing very well. Graphics is another example, right? We are very strong positioned in graphics as well and another growth opportunity. So multiple growth drivers and we are well positioned. The message is the industry is structurally different, and Micron -- the new Micron is also structurally different. And we are well positioned to drive the business going forward. Well, inventory in total is probably all we are breaking out, which inventory on a days basis right now is in kind of the high 90s. It's been that way for some time now. I would say we're comfortable with our inventory position. Having said that, if you remember in the Analyst Day, Manish, that runs operations talked about some of the things he was doing to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing group and, on top of that, improve, in particular, the back-end and try to make that more streamlined. And there's a whole bunch of things we're doing in terms of system improvement and process improvement that I think will actually have a pretty good effect on inventory going forward. So over time, I think you'll see us carry a lower days of inventory and improved working capital in the process. So as we mentioned, we see DRAM to be healthy in Q1, and we definitely see healthy demand supply chain for DRAM beyond that as well, given the well-diversified growth drivers for DRAM. So overall, we see DRAM in balance. And regarding the inventory adjustment, I just want to be clear that, that comment is related to DRAM. Good question, C.J. And I do want to thank investors for being patient with us a little bit. We announced this in May at the Analyst Day, and we needed a few more months to get the balance sheet to where we wanted. As you mentioned, now we have a great net cash position, we have debt now below $5 billion, that is 0.3x EBITDA, and we have great liquidity. We're now over $9 billion of liquidity, and we said we wanted to be 30% of sales in liquidity. So we're in a very strong position entering fiscal 2019, which I think is great. Our intention is to be fairly programmatic about the buyback, and so that $1.5 billion does represent more of a programmatic-type approach. Having said that, we did mention that we have layered, on top of that, some opportunistic repurchases, and so that will be somewhat timing-based, based on when the opportunities arise to take advantage of buying back a little bit more. In both Sanjay and my prepared remarks, we did talk about acceleration. And if you look at the $1.5 billion and kind of make some estimations around our free cash flow for the first quarter, you'll probably get a figure that is above the 50% free cash flow number we said we are committed to. So I think it is in the cards for us to be a little bit more aggressive over time, and we obviously think that this is a fantastic price to be buying the stock at.","Dave, I'm wondering if you could just help us understand the magnitude of the impact in the fiscal first quarter to the CPU shortages and just sort of the modest inventory correction we're seeing with some of your customers. And specifically, on the CPU shortages, do you feel like that's something that's limited to the fiscal first quarter? Or are you -- or should we think about that persisting into the fiscal second quarter? That's helpful. And, Sanjay, maybe as a follow-up. In your prepared comments, you talked about 2019 being a year of transition for your SSD business as you bring out NVMe product. I'm wondering if you could help us understand what that means from a financial perspective for your SSD business. Do still expect growth in that business in fiscal year '19? And kind of how do we think about profitability as you transition from SATA to NVMe? [Just in like] your commentary, and certainly, the CapEx paints a fairly positive view of the environment and certainly more positive, Sanjay, than what we've heard from your largest competitor, who appears to be reducing investment and preparing for a protracted downturn. So, I guess, my first question is, how confident are you that the adjustments you're seeing is really just a 1 or 2 quarter issue? I think a lot of us certainly believe in the strong secular trends that are driving your business. What's been a little surprising though is just the rate of change in pricing both in NAND and, it seems more recently, DRAM. Can you talk a little bit about that? And you mentioned some customer inventory. I'm curious, which segments do you see that elevated? I guess, 2 from me as well. First off, could you just maybe help me understand, when I think about the gross margin guide for fiscal Q1, it's down 300 basis points, I think, sequentially. How much of that is due to the tariff issue versus what's going on in memory broadly? And then as you go through fiscal '19, do you think these margins that you can improve throughout the year, especially as you [resolve] some of the tariff issue -- challenges? That's really helpful, Dave. And, I guess, if I could just follow up. On the NAND side very specifically, pricing has degraded for a couple of months, and your data, obviously, [that you put] showed that has declined as well in the quarter. Again, I'm somewhat surprised that you haven't seen demand elasticity kick in with output or your demand, I guess, improving much more dramatically. So I'm curious, what do you attribute perhaps to the fact that demand hasn't stepped up more attractively as pricing has come down? And do you think there's just a time lag for it to get there? Or is there some other reason why we aren't seeing it? I had two. So, Sanjay, first, I wanted to see if you can provide some color sort of in terms of your reduction in cost for DRAM in fiscal 2019 and whether you think it'd be similar to what you reduced cost in DRAM in fiscal 2018? Awesome, awesome. And then I had a question on the fiscal 2019 CapEx. So Samsung is pretty significantly -- well, not just them, but both of your peers are pretty significantly reducing DRAM CapEx next year. And it sounds like if I strip out the infrastructure and the building portion, that your equipment spending on DRAM is going to go up next year. So I'm asking about the juxtaposition of you increasing your DRAM CapEx when your peers are pretty heavily cutting DRAM CapEx next year. So I wanted you to talk about that dynamic and, specifically, what it would take for you to cut DRAM CapEx next year. Two, if I can, as well. Kind of building on that last question. As we think about what you've said about 96-layer and less of an incremental capacity increase when compared to that of 64-layer, I'm wondering if you could provide us some framework of how we should think about the next phase of transition to NAND in terms of bit output increases on a per wafer perspective. And then I have a quick follow-up. Okay. Fair enough. As a quick follow-up, I'm curious, you talked a little bit earlier about your NVMe positioning and then the portfolio expansion. You didn't talk much about quad level cell or QLC. So maybe if you can update us of where you see that positioned and when we should expect to see that kind of impacting the SSD business as we look through calendar '19 or into 2020. On inventory adjustments, is this primarily client side or data center side? And is this a statement more about just kind of higher accumulated inventories in the first half? Or is this a statement around the overall demand environment coming in less than expected or a combination of both? Great. And you guys have done a great job of improving the NAND mix. I mean, your margins actually went up in the quarter. Given the strong cloud spending trends, you obviously have a great mix of enterprise and cloud SATA products. The transition to NVMe is going to be slower than expected, so I would anticipate your SATA products continue to do well. So on a go-forward basis, and given your customer spending trends, do you guys anticipate continued mix-based improvements and benefits in your NAND business from a gross margin perspective? 2 questions. Sanjay, you have been referencing visibility onto data center. I think it's something that, I think, investment community would really appreciate if you could give us the thought process that gives you the confidence. And what are the key metrics that gives you the visibility? Anything here that could be specific would be really great. And I have a follow-up. Sure. I completely agree with you. And I think your Analyst Day provided a lot of detail and informative information on how the opportunities could be. I think what we are struggling with is how to model this, even if it's not on a quarterly basis, maybe on a 6-month basis, because perhaps, opportunities by 2020, 2021 are enormous. But what happens in 2019? And how should we think about cloud CapEx? In the past, we had PC units and we had content. We had smartphone units and the content. But now the cloud -- either an Internet company or a software company providing cloud services, it's very difficult to model this. And we have to think about how '19 will look like before all of these opportunities would materialize. And I was just wondering if there's anything you can share with us to help us with the thought process. Okay. And if I may just have a quickie one for David. How should we think about your NAND and DRAM aggregate inventory? Are there number of days? Or how has it changed sequentially? If I could ask two. First one, on the call, you talked about moderating NAND supply in the first half of '19. Curious, with the construct of inventory adjustment at a few of your customers, could you kind of walk through how you're seeing DRAM supply/demand, particularly as you also layer in some of the cuts that we've seen from your 2 other competitors in terms of equipment add over the last 6 to 9 months? Very helpful. And then as my follow-up, on the buybacks, you talked about a $1.5 billion or roughly 3% of the company. I'm curious, given you had the 10b5 program in place September 1, should that be front-end-loaded, thus more material benefit as we go through this quarter and next? And then also, considering you're now, I think, $2.5 billion, plus or minus, net cash position, at these prices, would you consider being even more aggressive?

Good afternoon. Micron is off to a solid start in our fiscal 2020. Despite a challenging industry environment, we delivered good profitability, maintained positive free cash flow and strengthened our product portfolio. Industry supply-demand balance continues to improve in both DRAM and NAND. Recent trends in our business give us optimism that our fiscal second quarter will mark the bottom for our financial performance, which we expect to start improving in our fiscal third quarter with continued recovery in the second half of calendar 2020. Our strategy to increase high-value solutions, enhance customer engagement and improve our cost structure is producing results. We have materially improved our competitive position, structurally strengthened our profitability and are poised to drive long-term shareholder value as industry conditions improve. High-value solutions in fiscal 2019 accounted for approximately 50% of NAND bits. We expect this figure to grow to over 2/3 of our NAND bits sold for fiscal 2020, and we remain on track to drive 80% of our NAND bits into high-value solutions in fiscal 2021. This mix improvement is an important tailwind for us as it improves our profitability and reduces the volatility in our margins. At our Micron Insight event in October, we articulated a vision for Micron's transformation through greater vertical integration and differentiated products for the new data economy. I will highlight 2 of these and encourage you to view Sumit Sadana's Insight Keynote available on our website for more detail. First, we announced the acquisition of a small company called FWDNXT. The FWDNXT Deep Learning Accelerator hardware and software technology, when combined with advanced Micron memory, makes it possible to deploy neural network models from any framework into edge devices for inference. FWDNXT's unique technology is an important capability in our portfolio that will help us learn and better address customers' needs in the evolving AI ecosystem. At Insight, we also launched our first 3D XPoint product, the X100, which is the world's fastest storage device. The Micron X100 SSD is dramatically faster than any other SSD, including those built with NAND or 3D XPoint technology, and we are proud that it was showcased at Microsoft's Ignite conference by their Azure team. In October, we closed our acquisition of Intel's stake in the IMFT joint venture. We plan on relocating equipment and certain manufacturing employees to other Micron sites as we rightsize the Lehi Fab. Redeploying equipment will also help us optimize Micron's front-end equipment CapEx. As with any innovative technology, it will take time to scale up our 3D XPoint product portfolio, ramp revenues and achieve healthy margins, and we are excited about the long-term potential of 3D XPoint for both memory and storage applications. As the only company in the world with a portfolio of DRAM, NAND and 3D XPoint technologies, we are in a unique position to develop differentiated products for our customers. I will now turn to technology and manufacturing operations. In DRAM, our industry-leading 1Z LP4 DRAM-based uMCP had the fastest revenue ramp of any product in the history of our mobile business. Our production mix on 1Z will increase throughout 2020, and DRAM cost reductions will be skewed toward the second half of fiscal 2020. Our previously announced cleanroom expansion in Taiwan is on track, and we expect output in calendar 2021. This cleanroom expansion is EUV-capable. While we continue to evaluate EUV technology for deployment in DRAM production, our current assessment shows superior economics through 1-gamma node, utilizing advanced immersion technology along with Micron's proprietary multi-patterning technologies. We are encouraged by recent industry progress on EUV productivity and will be prepared to deploy EUV when it becomes cost-effective to do so. In NAND, we are continuing to make progress on our replacement gate transition and expect to begin production on our 128-layer, first-generation RG node in the second half of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this node will be deployed for the limited set of products, and we expect minimal NAND cost reduction in fiscal 2020. It will be followed by an introduction of a higher-layer-count, second-generation RG node in fiscal 2021 targeted for a broader implementation, which will begin to provide more robust cost reduction as it ramps. This second-generation RG node will leverage our NAND technology leadership in CMOS under the array as well as QLC. Now turning to highlights by products and markets. In SSDs, demand from data center customers was strong in fiscal first quarter. Attach rates and capacities for client and consumer SSDs have continued to increase across our customers. There are supply shortages for SSDs across the industry, and pricing trends are improving. We are making strong progress on our transition to NVMe. As of fiscal second quarter, we will have NVMe SSDs for all market segments, which positions us to gain share in fiscal 2020. NVMe client SSD bit shipments represented almost 3/4 of our client SSD bits in fiscal Q1 versus virtually none a year ago. In the data center market, sales of our previously announced high-performance NVMe SSD nearly tripled quarter-over-quarter, and we announced a 96-layer mainstream data center NVMe SSD. While growing our presence in NVMe, we continue to maximize our value propositions for the SATA market by ramping 96-layer NAND products. We achieved qualifications with multiple OEMs on our 96-layer SATA data center SSD. Our QLC technology continues to gain traction. We have QLC SSDs in volume production for SATA SSDs in the data center and consumer markets as well as the NVMe SSDs for the consumer market. We became the first company to ship a 96-layer, second-generation QLC SATA consumer SSD. In mobile, fiscal first quarter MCP DRAM and NAND bits grew approximately 50% quarter-over-quarter, and our MCP market share increased approximately 50% year-over-year. In fiscal Q1, our leading-edge 1Z LP4 DRAM-based uMCP achieved qualification at multiple OEMs, driving the fastest mobile product revenue ramp I mentioned earlier. We are confident that 5G will be positive for both memory and storage content growth as well as smartphone unit sales and are encouraged to see the launch of affordable 5G phones with price points as low as $300 that feature a minimum of 6 gigabyte of DRAM. The 5G phones launched to date average 8 gigabyte of DRAM and 200 gigabyte of NAND, significantly higher than the average content in smartphones today. Our leadership on DRAM power efficiency continues to drive customer preference for our products, and we remain well positioned in this market. We have the lowest power and the highest bandwidth LP5 product that begins volume production this quarter, which we expect will become more important in 2021 as 5G adoption accelerates. In data center, strong server DRAM demand in the second half of calendar 2019 is creating an industry-wide shortage of high-quality, high-density modules, for which we are seeing incremental demand from our customers. New CPU architectures supporting higher-density chips and increased number of channels are driving strong DRAM content growth in servers. In fiscal Q1, we saw strong demand growth from enterprise and cloud customers. In graphics, bit shipments remained stable, with GDDR6 PC graphics cards showing strong growth offset by seasonal weakness in gaming consoles. In fiscal Q1, we began shipments of our new 14-gigabit per second GDDR6 and are well positioned to benefit from the launch of next-generation gaming consoles in calendar 2020. The launch of these new gaming consoles will drive robust multiyear demand in graphics memory, and these consoles will deploy SSDs in place of hard drives for the first time. This continues a trend of SSDs replacing hard drives across more high-volume applications. In the PC market, bit shipments in the fiscal first quarter continued the growth trend from last quarter. Nevertheless, we are cautious on our near-term outlook for the PC segment due to reported CPU shortages, which seem likely to continue at least into early calendar 2020. In automotive, despite sluggish worldwide auto sales, we saw quarter-over-quarter revenue growth driven by secular memory and storage content growth. Our leadership in low-power DRAM is also driving growth for us in this market. In the fiscal first quarter, we qualified and shipped the industry's first BGA NVMe SSD for automotive applications, which offers industry-leading performance and capacity in a small form factor and is well suited to service the storage needs of increasing autonomous features. Now turning to our market outlook. Our base-case assumption on which all our projections are based assumes that there are no perturbations to the demand environment due to macroeconomic conditions or trade-related developments. In DRAM, there has been a strong recovery in the second half of calendar 2019, and our view of calendar 2019 industry bit demand growth has increased to approximately 20%. This stronger-than-expected demand has resulted in pockets of shortages for us. We continue to exercise price discipline and walk away from price requests that do not meet our objectives. While these actions may impact short-term revenue, improving our business mix will enhance our long-term profitability. We are encouraged by recent DRAM pricing trends and are optimistic about improving supply-demand balance throughout calendar 2020. As we discussed on our last call, a portion of the strength in demand in the second half of calendar 2019 may be attributable to inventory builds in China, and we expect some of this customer inventory to normalize sometime in calendar 2020. As a result, we expect calendar 2020 industry DRAM bit demand growth to be in the mid-teens percent range year-over-year, which is somewhat lower than our prior outlook due to stronger demand in calendar 2019. We expect industry bit supply growth for calendar 2020 to be somewhat less than the demand as industry bit supply growth decelerates due to industry CapEx reductions. We continue to target our long-term bit supply growth CAGR to be close to the industry's long-term bit demand growth CAGR of mid- to high teens. In calendar 2019, our bit supply growth will be less than the industry supply growth of mid-teens, and in 2020, our bit supply growth is expected to be slightly above industry bit supply growth. Turning to NAND. Our industry bit demand growth expectation is in the mid-40s percent range in calendar 2019 and high 20s to low 30s percent range in calendar 2020. We expect calendar 2020 industry bit supply to be lower than industry bit demand as a result of industry CapEx reductions, and consequently, we expect the industry environment to improve through calendar 2020. Micron's NAND bit supply growth in calendar 2019 is likely to be slightly below industry bit demand growth, and in calendar 2020, will be meaningfully below that of the industry. However, we expect our NAND bit shipments growth in calendar 2020 to be close to industry bit demand growth as we ship our inventory during the first generation of our RG transition. As we go through the transition to replacement gate, we expect our multi-year supply growth CAGR to be in line with the industry's demand CAGR of approximately 30%. Before I turn it over to Dave, I wanted to provide an update on our business with Huawei. As previously disclosed, we are continuing to ship some products to Huawei that are not subject to Export Administration Regulations and Entity List restrictions. We applied for, and recently received, all requested licenses that enable us to provide support for these products as well as qualify new products for Huawei's mobile and server businesses. Additionally, these licenses allow us to ship previously restricted products that we manufacture in the United States, which represent a very small portion of our sales. However, there are still some products outside of the mobile and server markets that we are unable to sell to Huawei. Receiving the licenses is a positive development, and we are thankful to the U.S. administration for approving these licenses. Prior to receiving these licenses, Entity List restrictions severely limited our ability to qualify new products at Huawei. Although we are now able to qualify new products with Huawei's mobile and server businesses, it will take some time before the qualifications are completed and contribute to revenue. Consequently, we do not expect these licenses to have a material impact on our revenue in the next couple of quarters. I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance. Thanks, Sanjay. Micron's FQ1 results were largely consistent with our expectations as market conditions continue to stabilize. During the quarter, DRAM price declines decelerated from recent quarters, and we saw pricing improvements in NAND. Total company revenues grew sequentially, and our total inventory declined in absolute terms. We generated positive free cash flow during the quarter, made progress on our share repurchase program and further strengthened our balance sheet. The results on today's call reflect our previously announced changes in NAND depreciable life to 7 years from 5 years and the change in reporting from our previous disclosures, which classified all MCP and SSD revenues as NAND revenue to a view now that disaggregates these revenues into DRAM and NAND. The following DRAM and NAND growth figures use restated historical revenues for an apples-to-apples comparison. Total FQ1 revenue was approximately $5.1 billion. Revenue was up 6% sequentially and down 35% year-over-year. FQ1 DRAM revenue was $3.5 billion, representing 67% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 2% sequentially and declined 41% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew approximately 10% sequentially, and on a year-on-year basis, were up in the mid-20% range. ASP declined in the upper single-digit percent range sequentially. DRAM revenues included $435 million of revenues from MCPs and SSDs. FQ1 NAND revenue was approximately $1.4 billion or 28% of total revenue. Revenue was up 18% sequentially and declined 14% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew in the mid-teen percent range sequentially and in the mid-30% range year-on-year, and ASPs increased in the low single digits sequentially. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking business Unit was approximately $2 billion, an increase of 4% sequentially and down 45% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by higher volumes and moderating ASP declines. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.5 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 34% year-over-year. MCP revenues grew strongly during the quarter driven by approximately 50% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND bits. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit in FQ1 was $968 million, an increase of 14% from FQ4 and down 15% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth was driven by SSD volume growth and ASP increases. Finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $734 million, up 4% from FQ4 and down 21% from the prior year. Sequential revenue growth was mostly driven by the automotive market due to content growth. The consolidated gross margin for FQ1 was 27.3%, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. FQ1 gross margins included approximately a 240 basis point negative impact or approximately $125 million due to underutilization charges at the Lehi Fab. This came in slightly better than we guided to on last quarter's call, but underutilization charges are expected to ramp higher in FQ2 as production volumes decline. We still expect the underutilization charges to average $150 million per quarter in the first half of fiscal 2020. We have taken action to reduce our spending in the Lehi Fab, which should begin to reduce underutilization charges in fiscal 2021 as these actions are implemented. Ultimately, these charges will be mitigated as our own 3D XPoint products ramp into production over the coming years. Operating expenses were $811 million as we incurred higher-than-usual R&D expenses to qualify new products. We expect to operate at higher levels of qualification expenses for the remainder of fiscal 2020 as we continue to expand our product portfolio. As a result, we now expect operating expenses to be approximately $3.3 billion for the fiscal year. We continue to prudently control all other operating expenses and remain flexible should business conditions warrant. FQ1 operating income was $594 million representing 12% of revenue. Operating margin was down 38 percentage points year-over-year and down 3 percentage points from FQ4. Our FQ1 effective tax rate was 6.9%. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 5% for the remainder of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ1 were $0.48, down from $0.56 in FQ4 and $2.97 in the year-ago quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $2 billion in cash from operations in FQ1, representing 40% of revenue. During the quarter, net capital spending was approximately $1.9 billion, down from approximately $2 billion in the prior quarter. We are continuing to target FY '20 CapEx in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion. We generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $80 million in FQ1 compared to $260 million last quarter and approximately $2.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. In FQ1, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $50 million. In addition, we deployed approximately $200 million of cash to settle convertible note redemptions in the quarter, removing approximately 3 million shares from our fully diluted share count. We will continue to target deploying at least 50% of our annual free cash flow towards repurchases. Days of inventory was 121, down from 131 days in FQ4. Inventory ended the quarter at $4.9 billion, down slightly from $5.1 billion at the end of FQ4. Over the last 2 quarters, our inventory days have declined by approximately 15%. We expect inventory days to increase in fiscal Q2 due to seasonality and then begin to reduce again for the remainder of the year. We ended the quarter with total cash of $8.3 billion and total liquidity of nearly $11 billion. We deployed approximately $1.3 billion of liquidity in FQ1 to fund the closing of our acquisition of Intel's stake in the IMFT joint venture. FQ1 ending total debt was $5.7 billion, down slightly from the prior quarter. In addition to the retirement of IMFT's member debt, we used cash on hand to retire approximately $520 million in principal of high-yield debt. This was partially offset by the drawdown of our term-loan facility to fund the IMFT acquisition. Our balance sheet is very strong, with net cash of $2.7 billion, and we remain committed to maintaining a net cash position. Last month, S&P upgraded Micron's credit rating to investment grade, and now all 3 rating agencies rate Micron's credit as investment grade. Now turning to our financial outlook. As Sanjay mentioned, our outlook throughout our earnings commentary assumes that the macroeconomic environment and trade-related issues will not impact demand. Micron's fiscal second quarter is the seasonally weakest quarter for the industry. We continue to exercise pricing discipline and reduce business at customers where pricing does not meet our objectives, and this limits our business opportunity within the quarter. Additionally, in FQ2, pockets of supply tightness are limiting our bit shipments, Lehi underutilization costs are going to step up, and our cost reductions are likely to remain modest. However, we are encouraged by recent market trends and expect that FQ2 will be the bottom for our gross margins as pricing, increasing mix of high-value solutions and cost reductions drive better gross margins throughout the rest of fiscal and calendar 2020. We expect a gradual recovery to start in FQ3 and to continue into the seasonally stronger second half of calendar year. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q2 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion; gross margin to be in the range of 27%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $825 million, plus or minus $25 million. Interest and other income is expected to be approximately 0. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.35, plus or minus $0.06. As we approach the trough in this cycle, at the midpoint of our guidance, fiscal Q2 revenue will be 60% higher and gross margins 9 percentage points higher than in the prior trough, which occurred in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Micron's solid financial performance and investment-grade balance sheet demonstrate that the new Micron is indeed structurally stronger with higher lows and better cross-cycle revenue growth and profitability. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks. Thank you, Dave. Micron is entering 2020 as a fundamentally stronger company in an industry that is structurally transformed. Supply growth is moderating due to rising capital intensity and the slowing down of Moore's Law. Demand drivers are more diversified than ever before, both in end markets and in variety of memory and storage solutions. This change in industry dynamics creates new opportunities for Micron to innovate and provide differentiated value to customers. Nascent applications promise to further accelerate this diversification. Cloud growth continues at a brisk pace driven by new use cases, and 5G networks are just beginning to proliferate and will usher in an age of true machine-to-machine communication with billions of connected devices. And just a little further over the horizon, AI, machine learning and autonomous technologies will expand this potential even more. These trends are transforming every aspect of human life and driving secular growth in memory and storage. Micron's enhanced product portfolio, improved cost structure and talented team put us in an outstanding position to capitalize on the wealth of opportunities ahead and create long-term shareholder value. We will now open for questions.","So as we said last time as well as in this earnings call that we have certain shortages in DRAM on the leading-edge nodes, and we have brought down our inventory here, overall inventory down fairly fast, as Dave pointed out. And we have seen strong growth in demand in DRAM on high-quality, high-density modules for servers as well as demand trends have continued to be pretty solid. So shortages on the leading-edge nodes on DRAM. And on the NAND side, we have SSD demand going up substantially. And our 96-layer products, as we expand the portfolio, are being qualified by customers. We are seeing strong demand on our 64-layer node, where we are actually seeing some shortages. And of course, as we mentioned, we experience some back-end constraints as well. We have invested in back-end capacity, assembly and test capacity expansion, and that's -- will -- assembly and test issues impacting some of our multi-die stack on the mobile solutions as well as SSD solutions. The assembly and test constraints will be eliminated largely by the end of fiscal second quarter. So these are some of the things that are impacting some of the shortages both in DRAM and on the NAND side. And again, the demand trends continue to be solid. Of course, in CQ1, we see seasonality. And yes, some of our inventory may go up at the end of fiscal Q2. But overall, our normal inventory days is around, as we look ahead, is around 110 days and that's really a function of increasing complexity coming from the technology nodes as well as, as we shift toward high-value solutions, more SSDs, more multi-chip packages, they take longer assembly and test times as well. So those are the ones that are contributing to some of the aspects of days of inventory that when we foresee in the future, we look at it as approximately 110 days. So industry environment, in terms of demand, continues to be solid, pockets of shortages building all across the industry, certainly, we are experiencing that. And pricing trends overall in the industry. As you look ahead at 2020, we are yet optimistic about the improving pricing trends in the industry as well. Certainly, as we move our DRAM production to leading-edge node, for example, through 1Z that we mentioned that we did very well with ramping 1Z DRAM node in our mobile products during the quarter, so of course, those give us bit growth. It comes with the shrink capability, and technology transitions are the best way to achieve ROI as well. What's important is that we are being extremely disciplined and prudent in terms of managing our supply bit growth, and we want to make sure that it's aligned with our bit demand growth as well, as our long-term objective is to have our supply bit growth CAGR to be aligned with the industry demand growth CAGR. We mentioned that in 2019, our DRAM supply growth somewhat below the industry supply growth. And in fiscal year 2020, we -- in calendar year 2020, we see our supply growth to be somewhat above the industry supply growth. But all in all, our strategy is to have our supply growth CAGR to be aligned with the industry demand growth CAGR. We feel very good about -- when we look ahead at 2020, our supply overall position, and yes, I mean, we are experiencing certain shortages on leading nodes. And we believe that some of these shortages in the industry as well as, for us, will continue in calendar year 2020 time frame. And frankly, that's a good place to be at in terms of running the business because it helps you manage the best mix of the business as well in terms of revenue and profitability. So certainly, 5G will be a growth driver. We expect 5G handsets, smartphones to be more weighted toward the second half of the calendar year. Cloud CapEx, as you have seen the reports from various major cloud providers, cloud CapEx continues to be healthy. A meaningful portion of that cloud CapEx goes into memory and storage and that continues to drive above-average industry -- above-average demand as a percentage versus the average of the total DRAM industry. And 5G phones, I think it's important to note that content continues to grow as we mentioned in our script. I mean, of course, 4G phones content continues to grow, but 5G phones are driving a step-level function increase in the average content of both DRAM as well as NAND. And our estimation is that in calendar year 2020, approximately $200 million of 5G smartphones to be sold on a global basis. So overall, when we look at the demand -- industry demand of mid-teens that we have projected for calendar year 2020, keep in mind that it's building upon calendar year 2019, where industry demand in the second half came in quite strong. And in fact, we upped our estimate of industry demand growth to approximately 20% for 2019. So you are working off a large demand, larger than previously expected total bit shipments in 2019. And obviously, that has an impact on the percentage that we look at for 2020. But in terms of aggregate of bit demand, that continues to be pretty solid in 2020 as well. And as we said, 2019 was a headwind in terms of demand and supply for the industry. In 2020, we look at demand and supply balance as a tailwind for the industry. So at this point, we are not providing guidance for any time frame beyond our fiscal year 2020 in terms of CapEx. But as we have always said, we have been evaluating EUV technology. We have carefully evaluated EUV technology in terms of determining our road map for DRAM. And as you noted, through -- we have said that through 1-gamma node, today, we are in production with now 1Z node, starting production with 1Z, and of course, volume production also of 1Y node. So from 1Y to 1Z, as we look ahead at the next few generations through 1-alpha, 1-beta and 1-gamma generations, we see that multi-patterning techniques, along with immersion technology, will serve us well in terms of achieving our cost objective and having a highly cost-competitive road map for us. So we have also said that we continue to evaluate EUV. And when we see it appropriate for deployment in our DRAM production in terms of cost and efficiency of production, we will certainly be deploying it at a future time in that. But at this point, we see our technology road map through 1-gamma node to be in strong position, while we remain encouraged seeing the improvement in EUV productivity tool as well. But regarding CapEx for future years, we'll obviously always manage it as a function of our supply growth expectations as well as, as a function of technology and cost competitiveness and keeping our supply growth, as I said previously, aligned with demand CAGR. That's how we will manage it, and we'll share those details with you at appropriate time in the future. Yes. That's a good question. Why don't I try to take a crack at that first? So yes, the comment around 110 days is kind of an optimal level of inventory when we have worked off all of the excess inventory associated with the replacement gate transition and as inventories normalize. Obviously, in the 121 days of inventory that we have today, DRAM is a bit below that. Really what pulls it up to 121 is that NAND is quite a bit higher than that by virtue of the fact that we are executing on this strategy to hold a lot of inventory as we go into our replacement gate transition to augment what won't be a robust bit growth from that first node. As Sanjay mentioned, we do expect days of inventory to go up a bit based on mix and so forth in the second quarter because of seasonality, but we would expect it then to start trending down over the next few quarters, partly as we start to utilize this excess NAND inventory for the replacement gate transition and also as we start to digest and manage through this -- the mix challenges that have created a little bit of excess spill on the DRAM front. So it's just we should be in a pretty healthy place on DRAM within a couple of quarters. So I'll take a crack at that one, too. I would say, maybe to start with, that the first priority of the company is to make the appropriate level investments, both in terms of R&D, and which is why we have had a little bit of an increase in operating expenses because we do want to put the right level of investment in new products, particularly high-value solution products that will ultimately be the big factor in terms of our performance over the coming years. And in addition, we obviously want to make the appropriate level in terms of CapEx investments to make sure that we are, as Sanjay mentioned, investing the right level to manage supply growth and to make these node transitions. Secondarily, of course, our goal is to generate good free cash flow. And ideally, it would be to generate pretty consistent free cash flow over multiple -- or over every quarter. I would say, in the second quarter, what we feel really confident about is that cash flow from operations is going to be very strong. And we will, again, make appropriate level of CapEx investment that could drive the free cash flow to be slightly negative or roughly around 0 or potentially even a little bit more positive, but we're going to make the capital investment be what's appropriate and let free cash flow go where it goes. I would say though, just to put this in perspective, the trough quarter of 2016, in terms of free cash flow, was negative $1.3 billion, I believe. And so if you compare that to whatever we end up doing for the second quarter, this will be massively better in terms of cash flow generation, and of course, that's an indication of -- or an example of how we have structurally improved the business from a cost-competitive perspective and from a cash flow perspective. And indeed, if this does turn out to be the bottom, as Sanjay indicated, it is our expectation, barring any sort of macro event or trade event, we would expect free cash flow to track more positively through the remainder of the fiscal year and into the next fiscal year. So this year will be actually a pretty good year in terms of free cash flow. That will be 4 consecutive years of positive, significantly positive free cash flow for the company, which, of course, has never been done in Micron's history. So again, ideally, we'd like to have every quarter be positive. That may or may not happen this quarter, but clearly, we're on the right track in terms of generating positive free cash flow for the company. Yes. As we look ahead, we do see server and data center demand, particularly within cloud, to be strong. We have had, as we mentioned, in our FQ1, strong growth from cloud, and we certainly see that happening through 2020 as well. As we mentioned, high densities are actually in shortage in the industry. And it really is about all the trend of more AI workloads, more need for memory and storage, as EUVs get introduced, that can work with higher-density memory as well as have more channels, which is increasing the attach rate of DRAM content per server and increasing it. So these are all the trends that actually point to continuing higher-than-industry-average level of growth for DRAMs in the cloud and server. And same thing on the NAND, on the SSD front, average density as well as the average usage of flash in cloud and data center applications continues to increase. And we have always said that this is a long-term demand driver for memory and storage industry. And memory and storage is critical in terms of driving greater value in these cloud applications and in these enterprise applications, and hence, you are seeing continuing strong growth in these end market segments. And I would just like to point it out that even in 2019, while the demand to the suppliers was weaker in the first half of the year because the customers, particularly in this space, were using up the inventory that they had to meet end consumption, but it's important to understand that the end consumption of DRAM and NAND, even in challenging 2019 periods, continued to be healthy. And as we look ahead, this will be a strong driver of growth in the industry. But I just want to point out that as we previously discussed, smartphones, content growth there; automotive applications, continuing to drive greater content; graphics, gaming consoles, new gaming consoles are also driving HDD replacement with SSDs as well as greater DRAM content in those applications. So I think the demand drivers and our thesis that has always been there that the industry has strong demand drivers has very much been intact. And we look forward to good environment for our industry in 2020. So we don't provide cost details with respect to 1Z versus 1Y or from one node to the other node. But as we have said before that we expect our 1Y plus 1Z combined bit production to cross over our total bit production by summer 2020. That means bit crossover with 1Y and 1Z combined by summer 2020. And as we mentioned, we are doing well with our 1Z. And in fact, in mobile products, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw the fastest ramp of 1Z node in the history of our mobile presence. As we have mentioned before, we saw some China buying pattern that was above normal compared to the past that we have seen, and we attribute that to some of the U.S.-China trade tensions and perhaps some of the customers in China procuring and shifting to perhaps a longer-term strategy of carrying more inventory because in terms of the U.S.-China trade aspects, while Phase 1 deal is definitely encouraging to see that it's happening, but lack -- there is still ongoing for longer-term lack of clarity. So perhaps some of the China customers have shifted their strategy toward carrying higher levels of inventory. I would say that, that perhaps is an important reason. There's, of course, Chinese New Year as well that can play a role in the China demand. Chinese New Year is earlier this year compared to the typical years. But there is no question that most important thing is that the underlying demand drivers are strong. And when you look at smartphone content growth that's happening in all smartphones across the globe, including the ones sold by the China manufacturers, the content, both on DRAM and NAND side, continues to increase. And certainly, as we have talked about, 5G is the significant driver. And certainly, 5G phones are planned to be sold, perhaps in the largest quantities, in China first. So all of these underlying demand trends, I think, are the most important thing here as well. I'm sorry. I didn't quite get the last part of the question. Expecting... The -- what we said is that in terms of our estimation of the industry demand growth in calendar year 2020, we have baked in that some of the inventory that we may have seen China customers build, we have baked in that some of that will be consumed, and inventory levels will be lower than what we may be thinking at this point with those customers over the course of calendar year 2020. And with respect to your first piece of the question on Huawei, we mentioned that now that we have received the licenses, we are able to work with them on new product qualifications. And as you know well, new product qualifications do take a few months, a couple of quarters, before they get qualified into new platforms, and then we can potentially look at additional opportunities. But at this point, I mean, our focus is to resume that product qualification work, both for server as well as mobile applications. I'll have Dave comment on the margin piece of it. But certainly, as we expand our portfolio of NVMe solutions for -- from clients to data center and, of course, certainly on the consumer side as well, we have done well, as we reported for our FQ1, in terms of expanding the portfolio and capitalizing on increased sales of SSDs, and we certainly look at gaining share throughout calendar 2020 as we expand our portfolio there. I think what's important to note is that our share there is today underrepresented. So as we shift toward these higher-value solutions with expanded portfolio, I mean we are basically trying to bring our share in line with what it should be given our share of the total NAND bits, and this is the part of the strategy that we talked about in terms of shifting the mix of our high-value solutions, which now are at about 50% in terms of bits toward higher number in the future. And of course, part of that ongoing shift is toward multi-chip packages as well as discrete, managed NAND solutions for mobile applications, where we pointed out that on a year-over-year basis, we have increased our share by 50%. Yet we remain underrepresented, and therein lies further opportunity for us to be increasing our share in these markets. So high-value solutions is a very important part of our strategy. It enables us to gain greater stability, greater margin opportunity through the cycles as well as brings us closer to understanding the application landscape with the customer, and I'm very pleased that Micron is executing quite well with respect to achieving our objective in this area. So obviously, high-value solutions, the reason -- one of the major reasons we're shifting the strategy to high-value solutions is because they carry higher margins. And I'll just give you a data point. If you look back at fiscal '19 and look at these high-value solutions relative to consumer components, you'll find the margins were about 30 points -- 30 percentage points higher. So significantly higher opportunity to get higher margins. And of course, that obviously helps the overall margins of the company. Yes. In cloud servers as well as enterprise server, average density is around 3 giga -- 300 gigabyte per server average consumption of DRAM, and this trend is expected. When you look at the CAGR over the next few years, expect it to continue to go -- grow in double digit range anywhere, when you look at '19 to '22 kind of CAGR, around 20% CAGR for average content growth in servers, in cloud and enterprise applications. So this is definitely a high-growth area for the market. And when you look at the new CPUs, like Cascade Lake and other new CPUs starting in 2019, as I mentioned earlier, they support the usage of higher-density chips. That means they support usage of 16-gigabyte chips as well as more channels in the new CPUs, and that is definitely driving greater ability to use more content per server for DRAM. And of course, at the end of the day, it's about the workloads that applications are running and those workloads are requiring -- increasing requirement for speed and that's translating into increasing requirement for memory as more and more real-time data analytics kind of applications and AI applications are being run in enterprise and data center and cloud applications. So 3D XPoint, certainly, as we said, exciting opportunity for us longer term. It definitely gives us differentiated opportunity with -- as the only company in the world having NAND, DRAM and 3D XPoint. We have just introduced our first storage product with 3D XPoint, the world's fastest SSD. And as you noted, I mean 3D XPoint certainly has opportunities on the memory side of the business as well. And as we look at engaging with the ecosystem, as we look at developing our products, these are the kind of opportunities, both on the memory semantic applications as well as storage side of the applications we'll be addressing over the course of next few years, as we expand our product portfolio in this area. But certainly, 3D XPoint -- again, these kind of things, breakthrough technologies, take multiple years and require a lot of ecosystem work to get the full use of the technology. And we are well on our way, as we discussed, at Micron Insight. And let me put the plug here again that if you have not watched it, please do watch Sumit's presentation. I think it gives you a pretty good perspective on the capabilities of 3D XPoint technology and our vision of the future with it.","Sanjay, just a couple of questions. I guess, first on the supply shortages that you talked about. Could you please elaborate? Because on one hand, you're talking about some shortages. On the other hand, the inventories are going up as we head into the next quarter. And then I have a follow-up. Congratulations on the solid results. Sanjay, I wanted to talk a little bit about the CapEx guidance for this fiscal year. I think I understand the strategy around NAND to, kind of, constrain spending on the first generation of replacement gate where cost downs are de minimis and, kind of, weighed to Version 2.0. But I'm kind of curious, as you think about the DRAM strategy, especially given that demand came in much stronger than expected, this year, 20%, and there were some of us that thought at the beginning of the year, we'd be lucky to get to low double-digit growth. How do we think about DRAM CapEx from here and your ability to, kind of, keep up with industry bit growth? And I guess, specifically, my question is, how much circular leeway do you have in moving more of your mix of DRAM towards the leading-edge node as a way to grow bits rather than just shrinking? I guess a question on the DRAM demand side. You're outlining an outlook for 15 -- or sorry, mid-teens growth in 2020. I'm curious, as you think about that number, how much of that, I guess, relates to potential pulling of China demand, potential conservatism on your part? And within that, what kind of assumptions are you making around 5G handsets and continued cloud spending through 2020? I guess, just on the capital expenditure front. Obviously, you guys have talked about reiterating the CapEx, but you're also, on the Taiwan fab, you're noting that, that fab is capable of EUV. I know you've talked about that you don't need that through the 1-gamma node, but it kind of suggests that you are looking at EUV as potentially something that you're evaluating. Have you pulled in all your thoughts on EUV? And how do we think about that in the context of CapEx, not necessarily this year, but looking out into the subsequent years? I was hoping to better understand the company's commentary on its own inventory, which -- nice to see that come down in dollars and days in the just-completed quarter. As you think about your inventory, as you move through the year, I understood some of the aggregate commentary, but can you be a bit more specific? Because I think the company had been carrying extra inventory of some of these older DRAM nodes. When do you think that gets used up? And when you talk about 110 days, Sanjay, is that being on a more normal level of inventory, just given because the company is going to be carrying the extra NAND inventory for the replacement gate node? Should we be thinking about inventory running above 110 to allow for that this year? Or is the 110 really a this-year comment as you carry some of that extra replacement gate inventory? And longer term, it's something lower than that? Good to see you power through this downturn with positive free cash flow. I just wanted to get back to the comment that, Sanjay, you were making about the fiscal second quarter marking the bottom for fundamentals. And CapEx seems to be a little bit front-end loaded. So is free cash flow going to be positive in the fiscal second quarter as well? We've seen a strong reacceleration in cloud and hyperscale spending. Also seeing some near-term strong server builds by the Asia ODMs. And it appears that the excess DRAM channel inventories in this segment have been worked on. But wanted to get your views here. And typically, the cloud spending up-cycle duration is about 3 to 4 quarters. So even in a seasonally weaker period for PCs and smartphones in the first part of next year, do you see the server and data center demand remaining fairly strong? Could you tell us what proportion of DRAM bits are currently on 1Z technology? And what do you expect will be on 1Z technology by the end of calendar 2020? And what's the differences between cost per bit on 1Z compared to 1Y? I wanted to ask a bit more about the China inventory build that you talked about. Can you, kind of, talk about the reasons? Is it concern about ability to procure? Is it tariff related? What's the reason for the pull in? And any way you can help us, kind of, understand the magnitude would be helpful. Maybe, Sanjay, just to follow on Joe's question. Just kind of curious, you said it'd take a couple of quarters for Huawei to get back in the numbers. Are you embedding anything in the calendar '20 outlook you have? And I'm just kind of curious, following on that point, in terms of you're expecting some moderation from China. Have you seen any signs of that yet? Following on Joe's question, you're expecting some moderation after an inventory build. Have you seen it yet? Or is that just something you expect will happen at some point? Yes. And congrats as well as you weather through this cycle. Question on mix shift for NAND specifically. Sanjay, you had mentioned that next year, you will be ramping at a higher rate NVMe, SSDs as well as UFS controllers in the China handset market. Could you talk a little bit about the trajectory of those products and how that positive mix shift in NAND will potentially affect overall margins? Congratulations to the team for the execution. Sanjay, on the server and data center module dynamic where you're seeing a higher mix of quality or higher density, what was the density on average a year ago just to get a reference on how that has improved? And what exactly is driving this move? Is it a new process or architecture? Is it market share gains? That would be helpful. Great. And as a quick follow-up, can you give us a commentary regarding 3D XPoint used in main memory? If there is a road map for that this year -- this coming year?

We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today's date to conform these statements to actual results. I will now turn the call over to Sanjay. Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered solid fiscal third quarter results despite headwinds from industry oversupply and steeper-than-expected price declines. This financial performance reflects our continued strong execution on technology advancement, further cost reduction and pricing discipline. Our healthy balance sheet structurally improved profitability, and winning team set the foundation for us to emerge even stronger when the industry environment recovers. We are confident that the long-term demand outlook for memory and storage is compelling, driven by broad secular trends such as AI, autonomous vehicles, 5G and IoT. The new Micron is well-positioned to take advantage of these trends with innovative products, a responsive supply chain and well-established relationships with customers worldwide. Over the last few months, customer inventory improvements have progressed largely in line with our expectations in most end markets. This reinforces our confidence that bit demand for DRAM will return to healthy year-over-year growth in the second half of calendar 2019. NAND bit demand is also increasing in most markets as elasticity kicks in, in response to price declines over the last year. Even as customer inventory levels of DRAM and NAND improve across most end markets, producer inventory levels are elevated. Although previously announced CapEx cuts will start to impact industry supply in the second half of the calendar year, our assessment is that further cuts in CapEx and bit supply will be required to return the industry to a healthy supply-demand balance. I will discuss our actions on this front shortly, but first, let me provide an overview of our fiscal third quarter results. At our 2018 Analyst Day, we discussed our priorities related to technology, cost competitiveness and high-value solutions. Solid execution on these strategies has now yielded over 2,000 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement relative to our peers since 2016. Unlike the last downturn during which Micron's relative profitability declined, in this downturn, our relative profitability has continued to improve. In DRAM, we are on track to deliver good cost declines in fiscal 2019. We continue to increase the mix of 1Y nanometer and are meeting excellent progress towards ramping 1Z next fiscal year. In April, we broke ground on our new cleanroom in Taichung, Taiwan. And earlier this month, we announced the opening of a new cleanroom in Hiroshima, Japan. These cleanroom expansions will enable future DRAM node transitions of our existing wafer capacity. In NAND, we continue to ramp our 96-layer 3D NAND and are on track to achieve healthy cost declines in fiscal 2019. We continue to make progress on our 128-layer 3D NAND, which uses replacement gate technology. As we discussed on the last call, we expect a partial transition to this node with the full portfolio transition occurring on the second generation replacement gate node. In addition to these node transitions in DRAM and NAND, we are also improving our cost structure by increasing the percentage of products produced through captive back-end packaging facilities. These facilities now account for more than half of our total assembly requirements. Our captive back-end operations are tightly integrated with our front-end systems, enabling greater product customization, tighter quality control, improved responsiveness to shifts in demand and lower costs. High-value solutions now account for over 2/3 of NAND revenues. We made further progress in strengthening our SSD portfolio with the launch of our 9300 data center NVMe SSDs for cloud and enterprise markets. We more than doubled revenue shipments of our new NVMe client SSD to large PC OEMs, and more customer qualifications are in progress. As a reminder, this new NVMe drive is built with our own controller technology. QLC SSD shipments (sic) [bit shipments] increased approximately 75% sequentially, driven by growth of our consumer NVMe SSDs. Overall, the Micron team continues to execute well on cost reductions and on high-value solutions. While we are operating in a difficult industry environment today, our progress is visible in our reported profitability and increases our confidence in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value. Now turning to highlights by end markets. Our mobile business was impacted by U.S. trade restrictions, which Dave and I will discuss later in the call. Looking ahead, innovations such as 5G, foldable phones and advanced cameras will drive growth for our products. Our portfolio of mobile DRAM products features best-in-class power consumption. On low-power DDR5, we are leading the industry and recently started sampling the highest density die in the market. We continue to make good progress on our managed NAND products as well and recently launched our second-generation UFS product with best-in-class endurance. Within the data center market, cloud customers are turning the corner on inventories and most are approaching normal inventory levels. Our cloud DRAM bit shipments grew sequentially in the fiscal third quarter, exceeding our expectations, and early trends suggest strong sequential growth for the fiscal fourth quarter. Enterprise customer inventories are taking somewhat longer to normalize than we had previously expected. We continue to sample and secure qualifications on 64-gigabyte DDR4 server modules built with our 1Y nanometer DRAM. In graphics, we saw robust sequential growth as customer inventories normalized. We expanded our customer base for our high-performance GDDR6, which positions us well for strong growth in the second half of calendar 2019. In the PC market, DRAM bit shipments returned to growth as CPU shortages started to improve. Looking ahead, we expect strong sequential DRAM bit growth in our fiscal fourth quarter as laptop sales improve. In automotive, while global auto sales are slow, content growth remains strong, driven by innovations in ADAS and infotainment systems. Micron is well-positioned to benefit from the growth opportunity in this market given our leading market share, deep customer relationships and high-quality products. We recently began ramping shipments with an industry-leading OEM for their most advanced autonomous system, which uses 16 gigabytes of our low-power DRAM. Before talking about the market outlook, I want to provide some comments related to Huawei. As you know, effective May 16, the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, added Huawei and 68 of its non-U.S. affiliates to the BIS entity list. To ensure compliance, Micron immediately suspended shipments to Huawei and began a review of Micron products sold to Huawei to determine whether they are subject to the imposed restrictions. Through this review, we determined that we could lawfully resume shipping a subset of current products because they are not subject to export administration regulations and entity list restrictions. We have started shipping some orders of those products to Huawei in the last 2 weeks. However, there is considerable ongoing uncertainties surrounding the Huawei situation, and we are unable to predict the volumes or time periods over which we will be able to ship products to Huawei. Micron will continue to comply with all government and legal requirements, just as we do in all our operations globally. Of course, we cannot predict whether additional government actions may further impact our ability to ship to Huawei. Now turning to the market outlook for DRAM. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen early signs of bit demand recovery in most DRAM end markets. Based on our assessment of customer inventory improvement, we anticipate robust bit demand growth for the industry in the second half of the calendar year compared to the weak demand in the first half. Our view of calendar 2019 industry DRAM bit demand growth is in the mid-teens, with industry supply growing mid to high-teens. Despite early signs of recovery in DRAM bit demand, the excess supply and resulting higher producer inventory levels have created a challenging pricing environment. We expect that the strengthening demand growth will begin to contribute to an improving trend in producer inventory later in calendar 2019. Turning to our supply. At Micron, our focus continues to be on taking prudent steps to help bring the DRAM market back to stabilization. We are continuing the previously announced wafer start reductions of approximately 5%, which we expect will bring our DRAM bit supply growth for calendar 2019 close to market demand growth. The overall NAND market remains oversupplied from the accelerated supply growth driven by the industry transition from 2D NAND production to 3D NAND. Our NAND industry bit demand growth expectations for calendar 2019 are unchanged at the mid-30s percent range. We continue to target our bit shipments to be close to the industry demand growth rate. Since our last earnings call, we have taken actions to further adjust wafer starts from the previously announced 5% reduction to now approximately 10%, which will result in lower supply growth in the second half of the calendar year. These reductions are the result of both capital optimizations to reuse more existing equipment for our 96-layer conversion as well as lowering some of our legacy NAND capacity, which we announced previously. While we still believe the NAND industry supply is growing above demand this year, the market is showing signs of increased elasticity stemming from recent price declines. We are optimistic that the overall NAND market will start to stabilize in the second half of calendar 2019. With the higher levels of macro uncertainty and the relatively high levels of inventory on our balance sheet, we are taking decisive action to manage our DRAM and NAND bit production. In addition to the wafer start reductions that we discussed, we are also taking action on CapEx. Earlier this year, we announced a reduction in fiscal 2019 CapEx forecast from $10.5 billion, plus or minus 5% at the start of the year, to approximately $9 billion now. For fiscal 2020, we plan for CapEx to be meaningfully lower than fiscal 2019. While our CapEx plans are still being finalized, we seek to balance our manufacturing investments with our free cash flow objectives. I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide financial results of our fiscal third quarter and guidance for the fourth quarter. Thanks, Sanjay. Micron's fiscal third quarter results were within the guided revenue range and above the guided EPS range that we provided on our last call. We also generated healthy levels of free cash flow and made further progress on our share repurchase program. Total fiscal third quarter revenue of approximately $4.8 billion was at the midpoint of our guidance range and was down 39% on a year-over-year basis and down 18% sequentially from the fiscal second quarter. Both DRAM and NAND revenue were negatively impacted by restriction on sales to Huawei, without which we would have reached the high end of our revenue guidance. DRAM revenue was approximately $3 billion, representing 64% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 45% year-over-year and 19% sequentially from the fiscal second quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the DRAM ASP decline approached 20%, while bit shipments were roughly flat. If not for the impact of Huawei, bit shipments in DRAM would have increased sequentially, as we had guided on our last earnings call. NAND revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing 31% of total revenue. NAND revenue declined 25% relative to fiscal third quarter 2018 and declined 18% sequentially from the fiscal second quarter. Overall, NAND ASPs declined in the mid-teens percent range while shipment quantities declined in the mid-single-digit percent range compared to the prior quarter. Adjusting for the Huawei impact, bit shipments came in better than our expectation due to stronger component sales. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $2.1 billion, down 48% year-over-year and 13% from the prior quarter. Lower pricing across major market segments continued to be the leading cause of lower revenue. However, normalized customer inventory levels led to shipment volume growth in the fiscal third quarter, particularly in graphics and client. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.2 billion, down 33% year-over-year and down 27% from the fiscal second quarter, due in part to lower shipments to Huawei. Lower pricing and DRAM volume drove the quarter-over-quarter decline. Our managed NAND portfolio continued to show strength in the fiscal third quarter, with bit shipments increasing by over 200% year-over-year. The Embedded Business Unit revenue of $700 million was down 22% from the prior year and down 12% from the fiscal second quarter. Revenue was adversely impacted by broad macroeconomic weakness, weaker pricing and inventory adjustments in the consumer segment. Automotive and industrial, which represented almost 75% of EBU revenue, showed strong margin resilience with gross margins down only 300 basis points from the last fiscal quarter. And finally, the Storage Business Unit third quarter revenue was $813 million, down 29% year-over-year and down 20% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was driven by competitive pricing and an unfavorable comparison on component volumes coming off a large onetime sale we completed in the prior fiscal quarter. The consolidated gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 39% compared to 61% in the prior year and 50% in the fiscal second quarter. Lower pricing in both DRAM and NAND was the primary driver of the lower margin in the fiscal quarter. Gross margins were also negatively impacted by approximately 200 basis points due to underutilization charges related to IMFT. U.S. tariffs on imports from China were less than 30 basis point impact to gross margins as we have successfully mitigated approximately 90% of the impact from tariffs. Fiscal third quarter NAND gross margins remained above 25%. Operating expenses of $774 million were well within our guided range. As we've said on prior calls, our goal with OpEx is to remain disciplined with respect to expense control while continuing to invest in future products and technologies throughout the market cycle. Operating expenses also benefited from the strong execution on qualification of our 1Z nanometer mobile DRAM product ahead of our internal schedule. We delivered solid profitability in the fiscal third quarter with operating income of $1.1 billion, representing 23% of revenue. This margin is down 28 percentage points year-over-year and down 13 percentage points from the fiscal second quarter. Non-GAAP taxes included $162 million of benefits in the fiscal third quarter due to a favorable state law -- state tax law change and a change in our annual tax rate from 10.5% to 9%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fiscal third quarter was $1.05, down from $3.15 in the year ago quarter and down from $1.71 in the prior quarter. Fiscal third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.15 higher due to the $162 million of tax benefits. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $2.7 billion in cash from operations in the fiscal third quarter, representing 57% of revenues. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions, was approximately $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion in the prior quarter. We still expect fiscal 2019 CapEx at approximately $9 billion. However, we expect meaningfully lower CapEx in fiscal 2020. In the fiscal third quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less net CapEx, was approximately $500 million compared to $2.2 billion in the year ago quarter and $1 billion in the fiscal second quarter. We bought back approximately $157 million of stock in the fiscal third quarter, representing 3.8 million shares. For the fiscal year-to-date, we've returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks, which represents approximately 70% of our year-to-date free cash flow. Combined with the redemptions of outstanding converts, we have reduced outstanding share count by over 8% since fiscal third quarter 2018. We will continue to prudently manage capital according to our philosophy of maintaining liquidity throughout the cycle, investing in capital assets to enable cost-effective node transitions and back-end cost competitiveness and returning over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. Inventory ended the quarter at $4.9 billion, increasing from $4.4 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. The fiscal third quarter ended with 151 days of inventory outstanding or 143 days using our average inventory balance for the fiscal third quarter. As we mentioned on the last call, calendar 2020 NAND bit supply will be constrained as we make the transition to replacement gate. To meet expected bit demand growth, we're carrying higher levels of NAND inventory in calendar 2019 and 2020. We also project to carry higher-than-normal levels of DRAM inventory in calendar 2019 as industry supply and demand work toward getting into balance. Total cash ended the quarter at $7.9 billion, down quarter-over-quarter largely as a result of our $1.4 billion redemption of our Series G convertible notes announced last quarter and completed in the fiscal third quarter. Total liquidity exceeded $10 billion at quarter end while we maintained a healthy balance sheet. In the quarter, we announced that the close of the IMFT joint venture acquisition will be October 31, which is during our fiscal first quarter of 2020. We expect to pay approximately $1.4 billion for Intel's share of IMFT. A portion of the payment will also be used to repay member debt financing, which at the end of the fiscal third quarter was approximately $860 million. Now turning to our financial outlook. Both the DRAM and NAND markets remain oversupplied. Having said that, we are starting to see some signs of bit demand improvement. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect strong growth in our DRAM bit shipments for the cloud, graphics and PC markets in fiscal fourth quarter, followed by more normal bit growth in fiscal first quarter. In NAND, while the industry is benefiting from elasticity kicking in, our bit shipment growth in fiscal fourth quarter will be limited due to the ongoing transition of our SSD portfolio. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 29%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $785 million, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.13 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.45, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, despite the industry and geopolitical challenges, Micron continues to execute on our key initiatives and remains on strong financial footing. We will continue to draw on our strong relationships with our customers and manage through the cycle with a focus on gross margins and free cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks. Thank you, Dave. Clearly, fiscal 2019 has been challenging for both Micron and the industry. While we continue to believe that the industry is structurally stronger, the confluence of events that impacted this year was unprecedented. Still, we have fared better due to the tremendous progress we have made on improving our product costs, advancing our technology and increasing the mix of high-value solutions. Recent industry financial results show that Micron's profitability and balance sheet are best-in-class. Having said that, we are not resting on our recent accomplishments and are continuing to raise the bar for ourselves. Our CapEx and expense controls reflect our focus on profitability and free cash flow. With the economic and trade challenges facing the industry, the near term continues to be uncertain. But looking beyond these challenges, I'm excited about Micron's future. We are in the early innings of growth in cloud computing, and the value of data in the new economy is going to drive secular growth in numerous memory and storage-intensive applications. AI, autonomous vehicles, 5G and IoT will drive significant improvements in our lives, and we look forward to bringing the value of our innovative, market-leading solutions to our customers. In April, we issued our fourth annual sustainability report, which details Micron's commitments to enhancing the world we live in through our products and business practices. We achieved perfect scores on industry-standard environmental and social audits of our facilities in 2018 and 2019. Our ongoing focus and improvements in sustainable practices is a competitive differentiator for both our customers and our employees and an important part of the transformation we are driving at Micron. I'm energized by the potential ahead of us and proud of the culture of innovation and execution that we are building. We will now open for questions.","So as I said in my prepared remarks, after the Huawei was placed on entity list, we began a review of our products against the export administration regulations. And through that analysis, we determined that certain of our products, a subset of our products that we were previously shipping to Huawei, could continue to ship because it is lawful, it is compliant to those export regulations. And of course, it had impact, as Dave noted; in our FQ3, it had an impact because we could not ship at that time any product to them, of nearly $200 million. And for FQ4, there would be impact to our revenue. What I would say is that our revenue with Huawei in FQ4 would be less than what had otherwise would have been if Huawei was not on the entity listing. And of course, as we look ahead beyond FQ4, if Huawei continues to be on the entity list, then in fiscal year '20 as well, we would have an impact compared to what our revenue with Huawei would have been if they were not on the entity listing. Of course, we are a supplier to all customers and all end markets across the globe, and we will -- and our presence with several of those other customers is growing in terms of our penetration there, in terms of our share there. And we will continue to work on addressing those, but we would not be able to make up in fiscal year '20 if this were to continue the full shortfall. And we -- although we plan to make up part of it through other parts of the business. And it affects both our DRAM as well as the NAND side of the business. So with respect to CapEx, we have said meaningful reduction in CapEx from the fiscal year 2019 levels, and we'll provide more details in the next call as we finalize our plans. Of course, our goal is to have our long-term considerations in mind with respect to technology and product cost capability, but most importantly to have our supply bit growth aligned with our expectations of demand bit growth. And when we look at supply bit growth, of course, we keep in mind the inventory that we are carrying from fiscal year '19 into fiscal year '20 for both DRAM as well as NAND, which will help us supply some of the demand requirement in fiscal year '20 and enable us to reduce our CapEx requirements in fiscal year '20. And our CapEx management, of course, applies to both NAND as well as DRAM. So with respect to Huawei, as I said before, our revenue expectation in fiscal Q4 is less than what it would have been without Huawei being on the entity list. Beyond that, we don't really get into specifics in terms of revenue as such on a customer-by-customer basis. Of course, our revenue expectation that Huawei is baked into the guidance -- revenue guidance that Dave provided for FQ4 of $4.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million. And your second question with respect to... So on DRAM bit growth, we said it would be up meaningfully in the fourth quarter. NAND will be more modest given the environment. So as you said, the industry is in oversupply right now, both in DRAM as well as in NAND. And while demand is increasing in the second half, both for NAND and DRAM, the oversupply situation does persist. And we have talked about it in DRAM, a challenging pricing environment. And therefore, it's important that CapEx cuts are made as well as supply bit growth is managed to bring the supply bit growth in line with the demand growth as well as over time to bring inventories in line with expectations as well. So we are not providing a fiscal year '20 guidance at this point, but all of the actions that we are taking here are really targeted to restore the industry demand and supply balance over the course of next few quarters. So certainly, as you noted, we have made tremendous improvement in our cost position and with respect to our peers, and that reflects in our financial performance. As was noted in the prepared remarks, our margin improvement -- relative margin improvement from previous times, has really improved by 2,000 basis points, and that's because of our execution on the cost front as well as on the execution on the high-value solutions front. And of course, we have more room to go with respect to cost competitiveness as well as strengthening our high-value solutions portfolio. So we are extremely focused on this. And as we look at driving our future opportunities, we -- of course, when we make our CapEx decisions, we make them based on cost competitiveness of our supply in the future and, of course, keeping in mind our free cash flow considerations. And most important is that our total supply available to us coming from our inventory and coming from our supply bit growth, should be matching with our demand expectations going forward over the course of next few quarters and to continue to improve our inventory position. But on the cost side, we feel very good about the 1Y and 1Z progress on DRAM as well as we feel good about our 96-layer. And overall, even with the CapEx reductions that we are talking about, we'll be in a good position with respect to costs, both in DRAM and NAND next year. Of course, we have talked about in NAND, our first-generation replacement gate node will be a small node in the sense that it will be deployed across a small set of products. And we will not have any significant cost benefit from that first-generation replacement gate node, but the second generation replacement gate node will give us a meaningful cost benefit compared to the last generations of floating gate node. So we absolutely are on top of the game in terms of managing to our cost objectives. I'd just add that Sanjay already mentioned this drive to high value solutions, another way we can improve our gross margins, but also we're -- the node transitions isn't the only way we affect the cost of the product. And so one example is, for example, the back end, we're very acutely focused on the back-end. We are bringing some of that activity that we're doing that was being outsourced internally. We think we can improve our cost structure in that regard, too. So there are many ways we can drive the cost to improve it. And one thing I would just add is in terms of our overall CapEx that you mentioned, of course, as you know, that in fiscal year '19, we had a meaningful part of our CapEx, around $2 billion that was actually tied to facilities, cleanroom expansions to enable technology transitions. And this facility spend may not be the same from one manufacturer to the other manufacturer. But for us, that was a meaningful part to again, as noted in our remarks before, to prepare us for technology transitions and not targeting any of that cleanroom space for any meaningful capacity, but really for technology transition. A 3-part question huh, John? Okay. So yes, the inventories obviously are elevated right now. As you point out, one of the big drivers of our increased inventory level is in NAND, and that is kind of by design for us. We are trying to build up some inventory going into 2020 -- fiscal 2020 for us because we are going to make this transition to replacement gate. Replacement gate doesn't drive very much bit growth for us in the first node in replacement gate, and so we'll need to draw on our inventory in order to meet demand. And that's a -- I don't know the exact number, but that's a decent chunk of the overage in terms of days. The other aspect of the elevated level of inventory is in DRAM. That was a little bit more a function of a pretty good bit growth in the first couple of quarters of the calendar year of 2019. And of course, we had customers working down their inventories. And so inventory was building up in our balance sheet. We do expect now that we're in a place -- Sanjay mentioned that we're seeing inventories get to be in a good place in the cloud space, in the graphics' space, in the PC space. And so we would expect to start to see inventories start to come down now. We think we'll be in a relatively good spot by the end of the calendar year, may not be at ""optimal levels"" but certainly in a healthier place. And then, quickly after that, I would expect DRAM to be in a good place. From a write-down perspective, we did write-down about $40 million of inventory this quarter specific to Huawei. We have finished goods inventory with Huawei that does not look like that's going to get sold, so we did reserve that. Outside of that, from a kind of an obsolescence perspective, we don't see really any risk with the inventory we're carrying. We think it's very good inventory. It's got a good cost position, very good demand with that inventory, so unlikely to have any issue as it relates to obsolescence. The other, of course, area you have to concern yourself with is the -- any sort of lower cost to market issue with the inventory. And I think you can kind of guess by the quality of our gross margins that we're not really in danger of having any write-down associated with lower costs to market. So outside of these kind of one-off issues that we deal with from time to time, like we did with Huawei this quarter, I don't really see a big issue with inventory in terms of write-downs or reserves. So before we get into the next question, I just want to make a small correction. In the prepared comments, I mentioned that QLC shipment were up approximately 75%. I meant to say that QLC bit shipments were up 75% quarter-over-quarter. So I just wanted to make that correction. And now, I think we can move on to the next question. So I think we'll be able to provide you more details related to fiscal year '20 CapEx, et cetera, in our next earnings call. I will just point out that there is obviously considerable uncertainty here. As you can all see from the rather fluid situation with respect to Huawei as well as with respect to U.S., China trade matters. And of course, we are just staying focused on optimizing what we can control and really remaining nimble in our actions. You're seeing that how, over the course of last 1 year, we have, for fiscal year '19, managed our CapEx down from $10.5 billion, plus, minus 5%, to $9 billion now. So we continue to stay vigilant, and we are making decisive actions with respect to meaningful CapEx reductions in fiscal year '20. With respect to the further details, we will be in a better position to provide you information at the next earnings call. Yes. So it got up there and we did kind of work it down this quarter. I think we got it down to about 62 days. I would say, ideally, it should be in the 50s. There was a little bit of a mix challenge this quarter that kind of drove it up a bit and there is a couple of customers that have extended terms and they kind of hit us at that point. But ideally, we'd like to be somewhere in the mid-50s. I would say that as we -- of course, we don't know for sure what the list looks like. We have a general sense. Based on what we've seen, there's minimal impact from the incremental list. Most of what affects us was contemplated in the first 2, 1A, 1B, and then the second list. So I think it is too soon to tell. And keep in mind that in certain countries, 5G has already started to be deployed such as Korea. And there are, of course, leading suppliers other than Huawei as well for 5G. So it remains to be seen how this deployment occurs over the course of next few quarters in particular here. But there is no doubt that 5G will bring about greater applications for memory and storage, not only in smartphones but also in machine-to-machine on the IoT front. And all of this will drive greater demand for memory and storage. And we remain absolutely well-prepared, of course, in a flexible fashion to meet the growing demand requirements for the business that 5G we think will provide over the course of next many years. But near term, in terms of exactly what happens with respect to Huawei aspects, I think, really, it is too soon to tell. With respect to the cost declines, of course, we are continuing to execute well with respect to our node transitions as well as continuing to drive cost declines, the 1Y and 1Z nodes that you talked about. And we are on plan in terms of ramping up these nodes as well. And as I said before, we don't break out the cost reductions on first half versus second half. Of course, our expectations of cost reductions are baked into for FQ4, the gross margin guidance as well as, of course, that takes into account our price decline assumptions as well for FQ4. So all of that is really baked into it. We don't break it down. But keep in mind that as the new technology nodes advance, the cost reduction coming from new technology nodes is less and less compared to the prior nodes just because, as we have explained several times before, they naturally give you -- given the challenges of scaling, less [pathway] for bit growth capability and less cost reduction capability. So as we have discussed in the past that we would be introducing, over the course of our fiscal year 2019, actually during calendar year 2019, our NVMe products. And we started that first with consumer NVMe and later with our OEM NVMe that we talked about today and now also for cloud and enterprise applications NVMe drive. And these will take some period of time over the course of next few months in terms of getting qualified by customers, in terms of gaining traction with customers. And that's why we had mentioned that 2019 will basically be a year of transition for us from SATA to NVMe. I just want to remind you that a couple of years ago, Micron did not actually have investments in NVMe product development. We did very well and are continuing to do very well in SATA, as you noted. And we began to significantly increase our investments in NVMe product development a couple of years ago, and it takes a while to have these products in the marketplace. So in 2020, as our NVMe solutions get adopted by our customers and as we ramp those into production, we do expect to be gaining share with NVMe all throughout the 2020 time frame. No, I'm not saying that will not have effect on cost. What I'm saying is that we will be in good position with cost because our technologies -- underlying technologies give us good cost reduction capabilities from one node to the next node. Overall, from a cost point of view, we'll be in good position. And for NAND, I'll just remind you that our CMOS under the Array technology gives us the smallest die size in the industry, and that has meaningful implications with respect to the cost competitiveness that we have. So overall, we feel good about the technology and the production mix that we will be driving through the remainder of fiscal year '19 as well as through fiscal year 2020 in terms of meeting our demand expectations as well as remaining cost competitive. So getting back to the FY '19, just to be clear, what Sanjay said was about $2 billion was kind of construction-related spend. The rest is front-end and back-end. So there is some -- and some miscellaneous capital spend for the R&D group and so forth. So there's more to it than even that. I'll be honest with you, we have not kind of completely finalized CapEx budget for next year. We have a pretty good sense of directionally where it's going, but all the pieces specifically, we're not quite there yet. And so what we'd like to do is wait and give you more granularity around that in the next quarter's call. But I would anticipate that both areas would have some reduction to them. So with respect to what we are able to ship to Huawei, as I said before that what we are able to ship is what is not under the export administration regulations, and that's what we are able to ship. And actually, export administration regulations have various complex aspects and considerations, several criteria that you have to go through. If you're interested in that, you can certainly go to the BIS site and look for those. And we assess our products versus those. And these considerations are not just limited to any 1 or 2 aspects such as what you mentioned. I mean they have several aspects. And we assess our products that we can ship to Huawei versus those and have made determination of shipments. And as we've said, we began those shipments in last 2 weeks. And with respect to your question around other components, et cetera, of course, this is a company-by-company decision, and each company has to evaluate its own situation. And obviously, Huawei has to look at its own supply chain. So with respect to the products that we can ship to them, we work closely with them to understand what is their latest demand on those products, and that is what is baked into our FQ4 guidance. What I would like to point out here is that at the end of the day, since you asked a question about mobile phones, the smartphone demand overall from consumers' point of view is really going to be the same. I mean consumers are going to be buying the phones that they're going to buy based on the features, the new models. All of that will be bought. There may be some share shift that may be occurring between the various suppliers of smartphones. And as you know, we are well-engaged with customers across the smartphone ecosystem as a supplier to them. Of course, we have -- Huawei was our #1 customer. We continue to engage with other customers as well. And we will -- we have had growing presence with those other customers and we'll continue to look for opportunities to best optimize our business while always, of course, continuing to comply with U.S. laws and regulations. And for that matter, we always comply with laws and regulations in all countries that we operate in. Pace of recovery? In cloud and data center. Oh, for cloud and data center. I mean, as we said, I think cloud customers as well as several other customers had operated with high levels of inventory in the -- starting late last year and through the course of first half of this year, those inventory levels have been largely worked to normal levels, except for in enterprise, as we noted in our prepared remarks. And we look forward to robust growth in fiscal fourth quarter in the area of cloud. And we are, of course, continuing to broaden our product portfolio as well with solutions such as NVMe solutions, and that will bring us bigger opportunities in the future as well.","I guess, first question, I was hoping you could provide a little more granularity on Huawei. You talked about the ability to sell a subset of products. Can you walk through, I guess, where you're allowed, where you're not. They are, I believe, a 13% customer at least last quarter fiscal year. What kind of impact do you expect as we proceed in the coming quarters across both DRAM and NAND? That's very helpful. And if I could just follow-up... Great. And if I could follow-up on CapEx. You talked about a meaningful cut. I guess, is meaningful meaning single-type territory? And as part of that, is it more focused on DRAM? NAND? Both? How should we think about the implications there? The first question really following on Huawei. Can you give a little bit more quantification on how much the 13-or-so percent revenue you expect you will be able to continue to export to Huawei? And it is -- can you give us some guidance also for your bit growth for this next quarter? I don't think you have mentioned that yet on the earnings -- on the guidance. If you can mention about your expectation for bit growth for the following quarter. And I have a follow-up question. Okay. My follow-up question is really taking a step back and looking at the industry. Clearly, it's been a quite challenging year this year with the oversupply. But just looking forward to 2020 with the pretty severe cuts you guys are making on utilization, the CapEx, and we're hearing similar cuts from some of your competitors in Asia, I'm just curious what you think for next year. I guess it very much depends on the economic outlook, which is a little bit unpredictable at the moment. But looking forward to 2020, do you not think that there could be a danger of potential undersupply at some point next year? I'm just curious how you're thinking about that because, to me, at this level of utilization and CapEx, it seems like, inevitably, there will be a period of undersupply coming, just a matter of time. Sanjay, congratulations on the solid execution given the industry conditions. Just going back to the CapEx questions. I would argue, Sanjay, that one of the biggest strategic initiatives you've had has been to try to close a cost gap with your peers. And clearly, CapEx is a pretty important tool in which to do that. You guys are sort of bucking the trend this fiscal year with CapEx actually up slightly versus peers that have actually taken it down. I'm just kind of curious. Help us to get some comfort level that despite the cuts you're talking about for the fiscal year '20, you're still very much on plan relative to closing those cost gaps with your peers. And then, David, just on inventory, it's clearly a key metric that investors are looking at. I'm kind of curious as how we should think about inventory levels exiting the fiscal fourth quarter. And as you answer the question, can you -- clearly, the inventory is somewhat a reflection of where we are in the cycle, but you've got sort of the added burden of wanting to build some NAND inventory as you make this transition to replacement gate. So how do we -- how would inventories look if you sort of normalize for that? And then, lastly, as part of the question, I apologize, utilization coming down, CapEx coming down is a good way of controlling inventory, so is the potential for write-downs. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the value of the inventory in this sort of environment? Sanjay, good to see the discipline here on the CapEx and also with Dave's focus on free cash flow. I was just a little confused and I want to make sure I understood this. If we go -- and I appreciate that you don't want to talk about any specific customer, but if we go back to the reported last 2 quarters and if you triangulate that, if you exclude Huawei, that would mean that bit shipments would be at best up single digit. So the question is, in your CapEx thinking for fiscal '20, how are you handicapping the Huawei impact? Are you expecting this to continue to be on that list, and hence, your CapEx -- lower CapEx includes a certain amount of capacity being taken off-line because of that? What's the right way to think about it? And then I had a quick follow-up. Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up, and it's not a multipart day for you, what's the AR or DSO target that we should be thinking about as we go through the next couple of quarters? You said you've mitigated I think 90% of the tariff so far. Now we're looking at another $300 billion in tariffs. Can you estimate the approximate impact to your business if that goes through? Got it. And then for my follow-up. Sanjay talked about 5G being a big driver. With the Huawei issue, is that impacting the development of 5G? Have you seen any change in -- like the ongoing development of the standards out there? In DRAM, given the transition to 1Y and early 1Z move, can you guys just help us understand, qualitatively, your cost reduction profile as you move to the second half of this calendar year? Maybe compare that versus the cost downs in the first half of this year. Yes. And then back in April, the team announced its 9300 series NVMe. This is your new cloud and enterprise SSD family. I think you guys have had solid momentum in cloud and enterprise with your SATA family, and that's helped to sustain a better margin profile for the NAND business. So what's the design win momentum been like on the 9300 series? And when do you anticipate your cloud customers to start ramping these new NVMe products? (technical difficulty) that's been asked a couple of times, and I'm just trying to figure out how lower CapEx -- you're going to cut CapEx by a couple of billion and you're certainly cutting wafer starts quite a bit. How that doesn't ultimately have some negative impact on your costs? I think you've been costing down in DRAM maybe low- to mid-teens, and the expectation was that you'd be down somewhere -- that 2020 would be kind of another good year for DRAM cost downs, and you've been down kind of like mid-20s in NAND. So -- yet, it sounds like you're saying that it is not having much of an effect on your costs, so I'm just trying to fit those 2 things. And then, I guess, just related to that, maybe Dave, can you maybe break down CapEx, sort of how much is building versus equipment? It sounds like there's roughly $2 billion that was buildings this year in fiscal '19. Is the cut next year going to be almost all in infrastructure so that WFE is kind of flat to down a smidge year-over-year. Is that kind of how to think about it? I just want to follow up on the Huawei point, just want to make sure I understood what you're saying. Are you able to ship because the IP resides in another country? Just trying to understand how exactly are you able to continue to ship? And then just kind of curious, as you look out, I'm sure there's going to be some components that go into these phones from other vendors that don't have an ability to ship. So I'm kind of just curious to your thoughts on kind of the downstream impact and whether you've encapsulated all that? And then I just want to ask you on the cloud and data center, obviously an important segment and you did have some encouraging comments. Just kind of curious on that pace of recovery maybe versus what you had thought a quarter ago, just kind of the health of the channel and the pace of recovery there.

Good afternoon, everyone. Micron executed well in the second quarter, delivering solid results and healthy levels of profitability and free cash flow despite a challenging industry environment. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet in the quarter by increasing our cash position and total liquidity. Although we expect industry headwinds in the near term, we continue to grow and diversify our product portfolio, improve our cost competitiveness and lay the foundation to emerge stronger, both financially and operationally from this environment. I would like to start with the review of 2 important pillars of Micron's strategy, improving cost competitiveness and increasing high-value solutions in our portfolio. Our strategy positions us for the tremendous opportunities ahead, while also enabling us to better navigate near-term headwinds. Strong execution against this strategy has improved our annualized profitability by over $6 billion from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018. This has improved our EBITDA margin by more than 15 percentage points relative to our competitors over the same period. We expect further progress on cost reduction this fiscal year, including healthy year-over-year cost declines in both DRAM and NAND. In DRAM, our 1Y nanometer is yielding well, and we expect to increase conversion to 1Y nanometer in the second half of fiscal 2019. We are also making excellent progress on 1Z nanometer and have started sampling products utilizing this technology. As we have said in the past, future DRAM node transitions required additional process steps and more fab cleanroom space. Consequently, in addition to the previously announced expansion of our Hiroshima facility, we are starting site preparation for the cleanroom expansion at our Taichung facility to enable the transition of existing DRAM wafer capacity to future nodes. We are still finalizing the timing but expect production output some time in calendar 2021. In NAND, we achieved meaningful production on 96-layer 3D NAND in fiscal Q2 with the fastest yield ramp of any NAND product in our history. We are also making good progress on development of our fourth generation 3D NAND, which uses our replacement gate technology. Given the high initial capital requirements of floating gate to replacement gate conversion, we expect that our first replacement gate node will provide limited cost reduction, and hence, we are planning to deploy this node across select NAND products, with the rest of the portfolio converting later to the second node of replacement gate. This approach will optimize the ROI of our NAND capital investments as we convert our capacity. As a reminder, our replacement gate architecture will allow us to deliver performance improvements and provide us an efficient path towards scaling multiple future generations of 3D NAND. Given the limited initial deployment at the first node of replacement gate, we expect that our NAND bit supply growth in calendar 2020 will be below industry demand levels, and we plan to utilize our cost-effective floating gate inventory positioned to meet customer requirements. Turning to high-value solutions. More than 2/3 of NAND revenues in the first half of fiscal 2019 were from high-value solutions, up from 55% in the first half of 2018. This increased mix of high-value solutions, combined with our competitive cost structure, enabled us to deliver fiscal Q2 NAND gross margin in the high 30s despite steep price declines in the industry. In SSDs, we are making progress on transitioning to NVMe while continuing to improve our cost profile in SATA. In fiscal Q2, we began revenue shipments to a large PC OEM for our first NVMe client SSD, which features our internally designed controller and are in active qualifications with other customers. We intend to introduce cloud and enterprise NVMe SSDs later this calendar year. In SATA, we introduced consumer and client SSDs based on 96-layer 3D NAND in fiscal Q2. In the cloud market, our custom persistent memory solution, which combines DRAM and NAND, is now fully ramped and contributed meaningfully to our cloud revenues. 3D XPoint development remains on track with customers' samples planned before calendar year-end. We believe 3D XPoint technology will be a key enabler for numerous new applications, particularly artificial intelligence and data analytics. As announced previously, in January of this year, we exercised our option to acquire Intel's interest in the IMFT facility in Lehi, Utah. This acquisition provides us with the manufacturing capability and highly skilled talent to drive 3D XPoint to development and innovation. Now turning to end markets. I'll start with mobile. During fiscal Q2, we grew revenues and expanded gross margins year-over-year despite adverse memory and storage pricing and weakness in high-end smartphone unit sales. Our performance in mobile was propelled by growth in our managed NAND portfolio, where NAND bit shipments grew more than 5x year-over-year. We are also seeing strong demand for our 1Y nanometer LPDRAM due to its industry-leading capacity and best-in-class power consumption. Memory and storage content growth in smartphones continues, driven by features such as multiple cameras, machine learning, computational photography and 4K video. Last month, Samsung announced its premium Galaxy S10 Plus smartphone, featuring 12 gigabytes of DRAM and 1 terabyte of NAND. At Mobile World Congress, several companies announced exciting new forms featuring 5G connectivity and foldable screens. These next-generation premium smartphones will typically feature 8 to 12 gigabytes of DRAM and 256 to 512 gigabytes of NAND versus 4 to 6 gigabytes of DRAM and 64 to 128 gigabytes of NAND in current-generation premium smartphones. These trends will likely cascade to lower-tier phones as well. We believe that 5G foldable phones and upcoming innovations in augmented and virtual reality will drive sustained content growth for years to come and should reignite smartphone unit sales beginning in calendar 2020. We are also excited by the opportunity that 5G is likely to create beyond mobile as it will enable true machine-to-machine communication and accelerate data creation and analysis, which are fundamental drivers for our business. We expect 5G adoption to create increased demand for memory and storage in IoT devices, wireless infrastructure and data centers. Our embedded and networking businesses are already starting to see benefit from early 5G infrastructure investments. In the data center markets, the demand for memory has moderated this year, following exceptional growth in the last 2 years. The slowdown in demand is a result of ongoing customer inventory adjustments as well as software optimizations at some cloud customers. We expect growth to resume in the second half of calendar 2019 as we see improvement in our customers' inventory position. The new server processors that support higher memory densities are expected to be introduced in a few months, which should drive additional demand growth in the second half of calendar 2019. In fiscal Q2, we shipped high-density 1Y nanometer DDR4 server module samples to customers ahead of plan, which will position us well to benefit from this new CPU platform ramp. In graphics, we grew sales of our high-performance GDDR6 DRAM and expanded our customer base, which positions us for stronger growth in the second half of calendar 2019. We are seeing steep customer inventory adjustments in GDDR5 and expect them to be largely completed by the middle of this calendar year. We had delivered strong quarter in automotive, with year-over-year revenue growth driven by increasing demand for ADAS and advanced in-vehicle infotainment systems. In fiscal Q2, we announced several new automotive products, including a collaboration with Qualcomm for next-generation in-vehicle infotainment and 5G communications modules. We also announced a new strategic collaboration with a leading supplier of ADAS platforms using our full portfolio of memory and storage products. Like last year, automobile unit sales are a short-term challenge; however, we see the auto market generating robust growth for Micron over the next decade as memory and storage content continues to increase in autos, driven by advanced infotainment systems and the adoption of autonomous vehicles. In the industrial and consumer markets, we saw a decline in sales due to seasonal, macroeconomic and pricing weaknesses as well as inventory adjustments. We had important design wins in video surveillance, point-of-sales and factory automation applications. At Mobile World Congress, we announced the industry's first 1 terabyte microSD card using QLC NAND. In the PC market, sales declined more than 25% sequentially, driven by weaker pricing and the inventory drawdowns seen in other segments as well as client CPU shortages. We remain focused on our cost competitiveness in this market, and over 2/3 of our PC DRAM bit shipments are now coming from our advanced 1X and 1Y nanometer technology nodes. Now turning to our DRAM industry outlook. Since our last earnings call, DRAM pricing weakened more than expected. Our demand outlook for calendar 2019 has moderated, led by somewhat greater levels of customer inventory, weakening server demand at several enterprise OEM customers and worse-than-expected CPU shortages. We believe macroeconomic uncertainty is also contributing to hesitation in buying behavior at some customers. However, as we discussed on our last earnings call, we still expect DRAM bit shipments to begin infusing in our fiscal Q3, with demand growth strengthening in the second half of calendar 2019, as most customer inventories are likely to normalize by midyear. Based on our current view, we now estimate calendar 2019 DRAM bit demand growth from our customers to be in the low- to mid-teens, with their end demand a few points above that. Further, we estimate the industry supply bit growth is tracking to mid- to high teens. Given the lower DRAM demand outlook from our customers, we have decided to idle approximately 5% of our DRAM wafer starts. This action will bring our production levels close to our view of DRAM industry bit demand growth for calendar 2019. We will continue to monitor the market and take appropriate actions to ensure that our bit supply growth in calendar 2019 remains closely aligned with demand. Looking beyond our fiscal 2019, we expect bit demand growth to accelerate as mobile and server demand improves. In particular, we expect robust DRAM bit demand growth in fiscal 2020 bouncing back from a weak fiscal 2019. NAND markets remain oversupplied from the acceleration in bit growth, driven by the industry transition to 64-layered 3D NAND. Although fiscal Q2 pricing came in below our expectations, we are optimistic that demand elasticity and seasonal trends will support improving demand growth in the second half of the calendar year. We expect that calendar 2019 NAND bit demand growth is likely to be in the mid-30s percent range, with industry supply growing in the high 30s, and we are targeting our bit shipments to grow close to the growth rate of industry bit demand. We have been managing our NAND bit supply growth prudently, including adjusting our capital planning and wafer volumes. We are reducing our total NAND wafer starts by approximately 5%, mostly through reductions on our legacy nodes. Given these changes in DRAM and NAND industry conditions, we have reduced our CapEx for fiscal year '19 and are evaluating our CapEx for fiscal year '20. We are taking prudent actions to address the current market conditions while executing well on our long-term strategic objectives. I will now turn it over to Dave to provide financial results of our fiscal second quarter and guidance for the third quarter. Thanks, Sanjay. Micron's fiscal second quarter results were within our guidance as we executed well in a period of somewhat weaker-than-expected market conditions. In the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders, continued to improve our cost structure and strengthened our balance sheet through our first issuance of investment-grade debt. Most of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem a large portion of our outstanding convertible notes, reducing our fully diluted share count. Total fiscal second quarter revenue was $5.8 billion, down 21% from the prior year and down 26% from the fiscal first quarter. Revenue reflected worse-than-expected pricing trends in DRAM and NAND. DRAM revenue was down 28% year-over-year and 30% sequentially from the fiscal first quarter and represented 64% of total company revenue in the fiscal second quarter. DRAM ASPs declined in the low-20% range compared to the prior quarter while shipment quantities were down in the low double digits. Year-over-year, DRAM bit shipments were down mid-single digits. NAND revenue declined 2% year-over-year and 18% from the prior quarter. NAND revenue represented 30% of total company revenue in the fiscal second quarter. Our overall NAND ASP declined in the mid-20% range, while shipment quantities increased in the upper single-digit percentage range compared to the prior quarter. NAND bit shipments came in stronger than our expectation due to timing of demand from a large customer. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $2.4 billion, down 35% year-over-year and 34% from the prior quarter. The sequential decline was driven by pricing across major market segments as well as volume reductions, particularly in graphics, cloud and PCs. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit, or MBU, was $1.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year and down 27% from the record fiscal first quarter. Lower volume due to weak seasonality and pricing contributed to the quarter-over-quarter revenue decline. Despite the current market conditions, MBU revenue grew year-over-year due to strong growth in our managed NAND products. The Embedded Business Unit revenue of $800 million was down 4% compared to the prior year and down 14% from the record fiscal first quarter. The automotive business was only down slightly from record fiscal first quarter despite weakness in automobile sales. Other embedded revenue declined quarter-over-quarter due to weaker pricing and lower DRAM volumes. Finally, the Storage Business Unit fiscal second quarter revenue was $1 billion, down 19% year-over-year and down 11% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential decline was driven by lower SSD revenue, partially offset by increased component revenue. The consolidated gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 50% compared to 58% in the prior year and 59% in the fiscal first quarter. Fiscal second quarter results included ongoing impact from 3D XPoint underutilization cost, which approximated 160 basis points. Pricing came in weaker than expected in both DRAM and NAND, but strong execution on cost reductions resulted in gross margins within our guidance range. Fiscal second quarter operating expenses of $818 million came in at the high end of our guided range. OpEx included $37 million in onetime tool impairment costs that were not anticipated in our guidance. Excluding this impairment, OpEx would have come in at the low end of our guidance. We remain focused on controlling our expenses while investing in future products and technologies. We delivered solid profitability in the fiscal second quarter with operating income of $2.1 billion, representing 36% of revenue. This margin is down 13 percentage points year-over-year and also down 13 percentage points from the fiscal first quarter. The tax rate for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 8.3%, and we now expect our fiscal 2019 tax rate to be approximately 10.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the fiscal second quarter was $1.71, down from $2.82 in the year-ago quarter and down from $2.97 in the prior quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. In the fiscal second quarter, we generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations, representing 59% of revenue. Capital spending, net of third-party contributions, was approximately $2.4 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior quarter. We have lowered our CapEx targets for fiscal 2019 to approximately $9 billion from our prior guidance range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion as we manage through the current environment while maintaining investment in our strategic priorities. As we mentioned before, a significant portion of our CapEx this year is going towards cleanroom construction and assembly and test operations, which do not contribute to our bit supply growth. Fab equipment spend in fiscal 2019 is down from last year and is mostly targeted towards migrating 20-nanometer DRAM and 32-layer 3D NAND to more advanced nodes, with no new wafer capacity additions. The investment in these technology transitions provides compelling cost reduction and a very attractive ROI. As we have demonstrated over the past 2 quarters, we remain nimble on CapEx based on business conditions. In the fiscal second quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less net CapEx, was approximately $1 billion compared to $2.2 billion in the year-ago quarter and $2.3 billion in the fiscal first quarter. We deployed approximately 70% of the quarter's free cash flow towards our share repurchase program. We bought back approximately $700 million of stock in the fiscal second quarter, representing 21 million shares. Through the first half of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 63 million shares for $2.5 billion, utilizing 76% of our free cash flow in fiscal first half. We continue to do share repurchases as an attractive use of capital and remain committed to deploying at least 50% of our free cash flow on an annual basis towards repurchases under our current $10 billion authorization. In addition to the buybacks, we also eliminated our 2043 converts subsequent to the quarter close, which at current share prices, effectively lowered our fully diluted share count by approximately 9 million shares. Note that the underlying share count for these converts was 35 million shares, which could have resulted in greater dilution with increases in our share price. Inventory ended the quarter at $4.4 billion, increasing from $3.9 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Our fiscal second quarter days of inventory were 134 days compared to 107 days in the fiscal first quarter. The actions that we have announced today regarding supply reductions, combined with improving customer demand, will begin to address our higher inventory levels. We ended the fiscal second quarter in a strong liquidity position with net cash of $3 billion and total liquidity of nearly $12 billion. Total cash increased to $9.2 billion, largely as a result of our $1.8 billion debt issuance. Our debt position increased by $2.1 billion to $6.2 billion in the quarter, primarily due do the debt offering and recognition of premium associated with the Series G convertible note redemption. Subsequent to quarter-end, we used $1.4 billion of cash to complete the convertible note redemption, which reduced our outstanding GAAP debt balance by approximately $1.1 billion. On January 14, we exercised our call option to acquire IMFT, our joint venture with Intel. We expect to close the transaction in either late fiscal 2019 or in the first half of fiscal 2020. This near-$1.5 billion transaction will also retire the $1 billion of joint venture-related debt on Micron's balance sheet. Since we already consolidate IMFT's results in our financial statements, we do not expect a material impact to our near-term results. Now turning to our market outlook. DRAM and NAND markets are working through supply and demand imbalances. Our visibility remains low, and the near-term environment remains challenging. While there have been CapEx reductions across the industry, they haven't yet impacted output growth due to lead times. We expect our DRAM bit shipments to grow sequentially during the fiscal third quarter and at much higher rates in the fiscal fourth quarter. In NAND, we expect a modest sequential decline in our bit shipments in the fiscal third quarter due to timing of shipments and expect growth to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter. The output reductions that we announced today for DRAM and NAND, plus the $1.5 billion of CapEx reductions that we have announced year-to-date, will also help reduce our supply of DRAM and NAND in the second half of this calendar year. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal third quarter is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.8 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 37% to 40%; and operating expenses at approximately $785 million, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.85, plus or minus $0.10. In closing, Micron continues to execute on our key initiatives, increasing our mix of high-value solutions, improving our cost profile and investing in new and innovative products. Our solid financial footing, strong liquidity and substantially reduced leverage means that we are well positioned to invest in our future despite near-term market conditions. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for some concluding remarks. Thank you, Dave. In response to near-term industry conditions, we are taking decisive action to reduce our supply growth to be consistent with industry demand. At the same time, we continue to invest and execute against our strategic priorities to reduce costs and increase the mix of high-value solutions in our portfolio. The long-term demand trends for Micron remain very healthy, with tremendous growth opportunities across multiple markets. We continue to believe that the memory industry is structurally stronger with more diversified demand drivers and moderating supply growth capability. With our strong balance sheet and improved product portfolio and operating model, Micron is better positioned than ever before to win and deliver long-term value for shareholders. We will now open for questions.","Okay. So I'll take -- first, let me talk about our inventories. So as we noted, our inventories are now at 134 days. A couple of dynamics going on. So in DRAM, as we talked about last quarter, we expected to carry a higher level of inventory in the first half of the calendar year as our customers that have built up inventory start to digest through that. And then on top of that, what we did was we reduced our CapEx. And so the outcome of that reduction in CapEx should start to have an effect in the back half of our calendar year in terms of bit growth, so that will start to help manage inventory as well. And then on top of that, this quarter, we talked about further reductions in CapEx down to the approximately $9 billion, and we talked about taking some underutilization, about 5% of underutilization to kind of further reduce the output. So that should help bring DRAM inventories back more in line. So we would expect that back half of the calendar year, we'd start to see DRAM be in a better place. On the NAND front, obviously, we're at elevated levels of inventory as well. Now that is somewhat by design. As Sanjay noted in his remarks, we do have the transition from floating gate to replacement gate in NAND going on in calendar 2020, and so the bid output is not going to be very robust. And so the idea was to carry higher levels of inventory into 2020 such that, that would help support the end -- the demand from our customers. Having said that, we also -- part of the CapEx reduction does impact NAND as well. And also, we did adjust our wafer output by 5% in NAND as well to also try to manage inventory. So I think the inventory, we'll start to see improve in the back half of the calendar year and then into 2020 as we start to work through the NAND portion of the inventory. As far as CapEx goes, really, the way we're managing this is what we said when we talked about it at the Analyst Day. We're committed to our model of low 30s as a percent of sales for CapEx. Obviously, there will be years where that is above the average, and there'll be years that, that will be below the average. I think the last 2 years, fiscal 2017 and 2018, we were below that low-30s model. So it's not surprising to be a bit above that low-30s level for these couple of years. Plus on top of that, we had a bit of pent-up demand to get some of the cleanroom space staged to be able to manage these node transitions, and so we have a number of different cleanroom build-out initiatives going on this year, which is maybe elevating a little bit from kind of our normal run rate. But over the long term, you would see us be in this low-30s percent level. And as I think Sanjay mentioned in his remarks, I think I mentioned in my remarks, we're flexible on CapEx. We modulate it based on the economic circumstances. With respect to hyperscale, as I said in my remarks that we do expect that inventory will work through the system at our customers during the first half of the year. And we certainly are seeing evidence of inventory consumption by our customers. And we do expect that, that will largely be completed by mid this year. And we do expect in DRAM that growth will accelerate both sequentially and year-over-year for the rest of the calendar year. And second half of the calendar year, with respect to demand improvement, we'll be -- demand will improve in the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half of the calendar year. And of course, effect of CPU shortages, those will continue to improve in situation over the course of the year, and we expect that also to contribute toward improvement in demand in the second half of the calendar year compared to first year. So I think as Dave had previously mentioned in one of the earnings calls, that about 150 days of inventory is something that we are comfortable with. And when we really look at our demand at this time and look at our production output, we think it is important for us to bring our supply to be in line with the expected demand for the year. And it provides us obvious benefits in terms of managing our inventories more effectively, managing our cash flow effectively as well and really managing our business in a healthy fashion. Of course, our inventory is at good cost. There is no obsolescence issue with this inventory at all, but we really considered it prudent management of our business to bring our supply growth in line with our demand expectations. And I'd just add that the underutilization costs that we'll incur are not going to kind of layer into our cost per units. They would -- they will be taken as period costs within the quarter, and it's implied in our 37% to 40% gross margin guidance for the third fiscal quarter. Sorry, didn't meant to interrupt you, John. Our cost position will be good in fiscal year 2020 because today with our both 64-layer as well as 96-layer technologies, we absolutely have been outperforming the industry in terms of our -- at the die level, the cost on a per gigabyte basis. And that -- and obviously, as you know, we have discussed this many times in the past, those benefits come from CMOS Under the Array architecture, which Micron has pioneered, and we currently are in our third-generation using that. So that gives us a very significant cost advantage, and that will carry over well, giving us competitive mix of NAND production in 2020 in our fiscal year 2020 to meet the market demand. And keep in mind, the fourth generation of our 3D NAND, which will be the first node in replacement gate technology, even with greater number of layers, will actually have greater capital intensity associated with it because of transition from floating gate to replacement gate that requires more tools, more specific unique tools to implement replacement gate. And that's why we are really converting portion of our portfolio to that first-generation replacement gate technology. And remainder of the portfolio will convert from the third-generation floating gate to the second node of replacement gate later on. And obviously, that will provide us a bigger benefit when we do that. The second node of replacement gate will get higher layers later compared to the first node. So that will give us a benefit of cost as well as ROI and it will really be the best way to manage this transition for us. So in summary, even with increasing the number of layers in the current and first generation of replacement gate, we feel very good about the cost competitiveness with the mix of floating gate and replacement gate technologies that we'll be achieving next year. So bottom line is, we are reducing our output of DRAM and NAND. In DRAM, the reduction in supply growth is a result of this idling capacity, idling wafer starts is bigger impact. And in NAND, as we reduce our wafer starts, particularly related to the legacy nodes, the impact on the supply bit growth is smaller because that wafer start reduction that you mentioned is primarily targeted toward legacy nodes. So again, the objective of these is to bring out or to bring down our supply growth towards our estimations of demand, both in DRAM and NAND from the point of view of 2019 as well as 2020 time frame. And with respect to cost, as I said before, we have continued to outperform in terms of cost reduction -- year-over-year cost reduction capability in DRAM, and we feel very good about our ability to manage with this slowdown in DRAM managed in a competitive fashion with our costs over the course of the next few quarters. And in NAND, I just commented on our cost position there. And I'll just add to the previous comments on the cost position that, of course, next year, we will also continue to get the benefit of our 96-layer transition from 64-layer to 96-layer, the ongoing transition during the course of next year, which will also be helping us with cost. So I believe our cost in DRAM as well as NAND will be competitive. And I just want to point out that the benefits of reduction -- an output reduction go beyond just aspects of cost. They, of course include -- those benefits include inventory management and cash flow management. Yes, I think inventory might be a little bit elevated in the May quarter relative to where we are today. Obviously, as you point out, it does take some time. I mean, most of the CapEx reductions, we took in the first fiscal quarter, so those take a couple of quarters, but we should start experiencing that in the back half of the calendar year. And the underutilization, you get probably a quarter before it starts impacting you. So I think we'll be in pretty good shape on DRAM, as I said as we kind of exit the calendar year. NAND will take a little bit longer because of the reasons we cited about keeping elevated levels of inventory into 2020. We are not providing fiscal Q4 guidance here. But as we have said, that second half of this calendar year, we do expect that bit growth in DRAM to continue on a quarter-over-quarter basis, both sequentially as well as on a year-over-year basis. And that is already -- we are guiding to bit growth in DRAM for our F Q3, and that should continue in F Q4 and for the rest of the year as well. And in NAND, there is, of course, seasonality in the second half of the calendar year. And of course, we expect the effect of elasticity also to help improve the demand. And the trends of increasing average capacities in smartphones, both for DRAM and NAND, continues to be intact. When you look at the results that some of the cloud service providers have reported, those results continue to be solid, pointing to the demand and the growth in cloud services. And of course, memory and storage is an essential part of all the computing paradigms of the future that are increasingly being based on the [INML] as well. All of that bodes well for the long-term demand trends as well. But yes, I mean, we do -- in all of our end markets, we do see generally improvement in demand in the second half versus the first half. And of course, all of this is barring macroeconomic uncertainty. In case there is any further deterioration in the macroeconomic climate, then we can have different impact in this outlook. But that's what based on what we know today, that's our assessment of demand expectations. So demand has been weak so far this year, and we expect demand environment to be weak in the first half as well. So when we talk about our total DRAM demand growth expectation, we are talking about the full year basis, right? So we need to be -- and when we look at our supply growth, of course, we are looking at that, too, on a full year basis. So we want to bring our supply in line with our demand expectations. And we believe that this improving demand environment, second half versus first half that I referred to earlier, we will be able to capture the benefit of that with our supply cutbacks that we have mentioned and also help bring our -- over time continue to drive improvement in our inventory position as well. Yes, good question. We do expect healthy cost declines in both DRAM and NAND this year. We are still making technology transitions next year. And so we would obviously expect, particularly in DRAM, that cost will be good. As we said, replacement gate might not be where we want it to be, in the very first generation. But one of the advantages of carrying the inventory we're carrying, 64-layer and 96-layer inventory in the next year is that it has a very good cost structure, and so we should have a good cost structure in 2020 on NAND as well. The other thing, on utilization, just -- I just want to make sure it's clear what period cost means is we will take that expense kind of as it comes in the quarters in which we take the underutilization. It won't roll up into inventory. It won't be counted as part of the cost. So obviously, it will have an impact on margins. And as I said, it's implied in the guidance of the margins we gave for the fiscal third quarter. And on NAND, I just want to point out again that 96-layer is still early in our production ramp, and it will continue to ramp during the course of next year as we bring out our first node of replacement gate. So 96-layer will also continue to be a strong driver of our cost reduction capability in 2020. So obviously, we pay a lot of attention to this in terms of managing the mix of our production. We do that on an ongoing basis anyhow in production. And when we implement this output cut, both in NAND as well as DRAM, obviously, we make sure that we are not able -- we are not impacting any aspect of our ability to fulfill our demand. So as we said -- I mean, we have high levels of inventory currently, both in NAND and DRAM, and it gives us an opportunity to bring our production to be in line with demand. And when we say that, we mean that we will be able to address the demand in all of our end markets. We are not going to compromise our production cuts so that we run low in terms of meeting our customers' requirements in any of the end market segments. So we believe this is a very prudent way for us to manage our business. With respect to NAND elasticity, I mean, certainly the average capacities in notebook PCs as well as the attach rates of SSDs to notebooks does continue to go [out],  so that is, of course, a price-elastic market as well. And the price -- attractive price points of NAND, of course, provide benefits of greater HDD replacement, both in the data center market as well as in the client market. Mobile definitely continues to be pointing to elasticity with respect to NAND. At Mobile World Congress, you saw smartphones, foldable phones and 5G phones being announced with 512 gigabyte and terabyte of storage capacities in them. And again, applications are also advancing toward features that require more and more storage. For example, 5G will have greater connectivity as well as low latency, will of course, be driving applications that will need more DRAM as well as more NAND. So applications -- end-market applications continue to do very well, and Micron itself, with respect to our product portfolio, we are very much focused on continuing to expand our product offerings. And we have also on the SSD side, we are expanding our portfolio with NVMe solutions. We have just brought our first NVMe client drive into the market, and later this year, we will have NVMe for enterprise and cloud applications as well. So this is -- and we announced that we got a qualification win and just began shipment to a customer with our NVMe -- first-generation NVMe client driver as well. So these are all the things that we are absolutely focused on in terms of a road map toward expanding our opportunities. And of course, we have made a lot of improvement with respect to some of these solutions over the course of last couple of years. And there's a lot of execution that is remaining ahead of us with respect to expanding our SSD opportunities, for example, as well as growing our mobile opportunities on the NAND side, where we have gained meaningful share over the course of last few quarters, but there is a lot more opportunity and a lot more road map execution that is required for us here. So with respect to the timing of demand in the second quarter, that was, as we mentioned, it was a large customer's timing of specific fulfillment of their demand, and that's what -- and that was related to NAND. And with respect to the second part of your question, as I said before, that we do see evidence of inventory consumption by our customers, and that gives us confidence that this inventory will largely work itself through the system in the first half with improvements in demand in the second half. And we have also, certainly in recent weeks, seen some new orders from certain customers that previously had high inventories. Of course, too soon to use this as any kind of a slope in terms of demand buildup from here on. But bottom line is that ultimately, the end-market demand drivers continue to be strong. The consumption of DRAM by our customers in the end markets, particularly cloud markets, continues to be healthy. It's just that those customers are using up their inventory to meet that demand. And over the course of next few months, by mid this year, that inventory will be returning to normalized levels to a large extent. Then that will provide for opportunities for greater demand in the second half of the year compared to the first half. We got a little -- most of that. Okay, let me see if I can take a crack at it, Joe. There's some background noise. So yes, as you cite, inventories were up. We do expect DRAM to grow sequentially in the third fiscal quarter. That combined with -- are starting to see some benefit. You might want to put it on mute. So those should be the combination of the reduction utilization and the CapEx activities, our CapEx reductions that we've already put in place, will start to adjust the bit output growth. So we will start to see some benefit from that in the fiscal third quarter. As I've said we do expect inventories to be up again next quarter. But then, as Sanjay cited, a lot of the customers that have built up inventory will start to be back to normal and they'll start to place heavy orders on us again in the third and fourth calendar year. We'll start to see these reductions in the DRAM inventory levels.","I just wanted to focus on the inventory situation. Sanjay, you talked about hyperscale inventories a couple of times and that they are tying up also, trying to see what the balance sheet inventory would do. So a, just update on where are we on the -- in terms of weeks of inventory. And then my sort of quick follow-up, Dave, what's the flex CapEx now left that you could moderate down if the conditions were to get worse? And the hyperscale? Sanjay, I guess, I just wanted a little bit more detail behind the decision to actually shutter some DRAM capacity in the current quarter. Last quarter, you talked about how a flattening cost curve actually increased the useful life of holding inventory, which seemed to make sense to me. There seems to be a little bit of a reversion from that. And just given that you're not a big enough piece of the DRAM market to, I think, impact overall supply and demand, it really kind of depends upon what the guys in Korea are doing. I'm just kind of curious as to why you came to this decision to shutter some capacity. That's okay. So Sanjay, you explained why in fiscal 2020, you will undergrow the industry in NAND bit as you move to fourth generation. I'm wondering if you can help us understand what the cost implication of that is. Will your cost curve in NAND be negatively impacted? Or should you be able to benefit in 2020 from continued mix towards 96-layer on the technology side and just product mix to more manage NAND? How do we think about costs in fiscal year 2020? I guess, a 2-part question. You used the word idling regarding the 5% for DRAM and then reducing your NAND wafer starts by 5%. I guess, 2 questions to that. Are you trying to send us a different signal in terms of what you're doing for both? And then could you provide a little clarity on how we should think about the impact to your cost structure as you slow down wafers? And then when you start to turn back on, how should we think about the impact? So back to a question on inventory. So when you first started seeing your customer demand inventory-related weakness, it always takes time for the actual supply growth output of your manufacturing infrastructure to kind of trend towards your target. So initially, you augment that manufacturing ramp-down with some inventory accumulation. It appears that you executed to that in fiscal Q2. But now that you're moderating output lower again, again, that's going to -- it appears that it's going to take some more time. So do you anticipate inventories actually moving higher here in the mid-quarter before it starts to downshift in the back half of the calendar year? Great. And then my follow-up question, much of -- Sanjay, much of your industry outlook is based off of a view of second half improvements in virtually all of your target markets, PC client, cloud, mobile, et cetera. Given the value chain and lead time, should we anticipate that your customer second half recovery should start to drive an inflection in your NAND and DRAM business in fiscal Q4? Sanjay, I wanted to go back just to a question that got asked before. So in DRAM, you're still well above cash cost, yet you're idling capacity. So obviously, demand is a lot worse than you expected. But you sound pretty optimistic that it's going to come back in the back half of the year. So why would you reduce starts now if you're so optimistic about demand coming back in the back of the year? I get that it has to do with inventory, but I'm just trying to reconcile those 2 comments because it seems like you're leaving money on the table. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, Dave. I just wanted to go back to the question on costs. You've been bringing DRAM cost down kind of like low to mid-teens year-over-year and NAND has been kind of in the mid-20s year-over-year. So it seems like some of these actions have to ultimately impact your ability to cost-down vis-à-vis that level. Am I missing something there? Because it sounds like you're saying that there's no impact, so can you just again reconcile those for me? I wanted just kind of go back to bit growth. I understand that idling your wafer starts slows your bit supply, but do you expect any shifts in your portfolio mix towards certain end markets or shift toward new technology nodes that should impact your second half bit supply? I appreciate that. I guess, perhaps a clarification on that question then. The cynic would say that NAND demand elasticity has not yet kicked in. So could you just perhaps shed some light on design wins, maybe not just in NAND but also in DRAM that you've seen across your product portfolio that would anchor your view of a second half recovery? I was curious on the customer timing, if you can elaborate. Was that just timing between quarters or was that more of a strategic buy that was multi-quarters in nature? And then I was just curious if you can elaborate on the data center you said back in the second half. It seems like, are you not seeing a pickup in orders yet? And kind of what gives you confidence that you're going to see that start in Q3? Just curious on the inventory side for the May quarter, and sort of Harlan's question, to the extent that you built 27 days of inventory, this last quarter, it seemed like a fair amount of the production went on to the balance sheet. Wouldn't you need to have bits (inaudible) in order to only have inventories be up a little bit? And I guess, I just wanted some confirmation around that.

Good afternoon. Fiscal 2019 was another solid year of execution as we continue to transform the New Micron. Despite the challenging industry environment, we achieved the second-best year in our history of revenue, free cash flow and earnings, which underscores the strength of the New Micron. We improved structural profitability by further reducing the technology gap with competitors and by strengthening our product portfolio. We also made progress on our $10 billion share repurchase program by returning $2.7 billion to our shareholders. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the Micron team's strong execution resulted in financial performance exceeding our guidance ranges. Market trends were broadly consistent with our expectations discussed on the last earnings call. DRAM demand bounced back as the factors that impacted calendar first half demand largely dissipated. NAND elasticity is driving robust demand growth, causing industry inventories to improve rapidly. While the demand recovery in DRAM and NAND is encouraging, we remain mindful of ongoing macroeconomic and trade uncertainties. I will provide more color on our view of the market after the review of progress on our key strategic objectives. Since 2016, the actions we have taken to reduce our cost structure, increase our mix of high-value solutions and enhance our customer engagement and go-to-market strategy have significantly improved our profitability relative to our peers. In fiscal 2019, our DRAM cost per bit declines led the industry and exceeded our internal plans despite the headwinds from our announced reduction in wafer starts. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we began mass production and volume shipments of the industry's first 1Z products, giving Micron feature size leadership for DRAM. We are also making good progress migrating more of our production to leading-edge nodes. While we enter fiscal 2019 with more than half of our bit production on 20-nanometer or older nodes, we ended the fiscal year with approximately 3/4 on 1X and beyond, with a meaningful portion on 1Y. As previously announced, we are expanding cleanroom space in our Taichung, Taiwan site to support future node transitions of our existing wafer capacity, and we expect output from this facility in calendar 2021. In NAND, we continued to outpace industry cost declines during fiscal 2019. 96-layer 3D NAND is continuing to increase as a portion of our mix. Meanwhile, we achieved our first yielding dies using replacement gate or RG for short. This milestone further reduces the risk for our RG transition. As a reminder, our first RG node will be 128 layers and will be used for a select set of products. We don't expect RG to deliver meaningful cost reductions until fiscal 2021 when our second-generation RG node is broadly deployed. Consequently, we are expecting minimal cost reductions in NAND in fiscal 2020. Our RG production deployment approach will optimize the ROI of our NAND capital investments. In addition, we announced the grand opening of our Singapore cleanroom expansion in August. This will enable the transition of our existing NAND wafer capacity to future generations of 3D NAND technology. We are continuing to make solid progress with our 3D XPoint product development and remain on track to launch our initial products in calendar 2019. Now turning to highlights by markets. In SSDs, the industry transition from SATA to NVMe in fiscal 2019 continued at a rapid rate. While we have been late to the NVMe market, our progress positions us to gain share starting in fiscal 2020. For OEMs, building on strong growth last quarter, we more than tripled revenue shipments of our NVMe client SSD sequentially with sales penetration in multiple Tier 1 PC OEMs. Our QLC-based NVMe consumer SSD was a best-selling SSD on Amazon Prime Day in North America. Our consumer SSD segment achieved record revenue and unit shipments with bits posting triple digit percentage growth year-over-year driven by our strategy to pursue channel expansion that extends our geographical and customer reach. Price elasticity is driving an increase in attach rates and capacities, leading to solid demand growth across client and consumer SSDs. We are also making solid progress on advancing our road map of NVMe SSDs for the enterprise and cloud markets. In fiscal 2019, we introduced the high-performance 9300 line of NVMe products targeting high-end data center applications and are looking forward to increasing adoption of this product. In mobile, our portfolio featuring the industry's lowest-power and highest-density products is enabling our customers to bring differentiated capabilities to the market and helping us deliver outstanding financial performance in a challenging industry environment. In fiscal 2019, we delivered mobile revenue that was down only 3% from 2018's record performance despite a significant drop in market pricing and the impact from the addition of Huawei to the Entity List. Our mobile margins were resilient and our managed NAND bit shipments in fiscal 2019 more than tripled year-on-year driven by growth of MCP and discrete NAND eMMC and UFS products. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we started volume shipments of a new leading-edge UFS-based MCP that uses our 1Z LPDRAM. This new UFS MCP will bring flagship-like performance and densities to mid- and high-end smartphones. We are also leading the industry in power efficient, high-bandwidth LP5 DRAM, which positions us well as 5G begins to accelerate in 2020. In data center, customer inventories for DRAM have reduced significantly, driving solid sequential demand growth for server solutions in both cloud and enterprise markets. New processor platforms are also creating an uptick in demand for higher-density and higher-performance DRAM modules. In graphics, we saw strong sequential bit growth with increases for graphics cards and gaming consoles as normal buying resumed following inventory reductions in DRAM. In the PC market, DRAM module and SSD shipments continued the growth trend from last quarter as CPU shortages further subsided. In automotive, we continued to increase revenue year-over-year despite weak auto industry unit sales and a challenging DRAM industry environment. Our growth was supported by secular content increases, our superior quality and well-established customer relationships. LP4 shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter were over 5x higher year-over-year as lower-power DRAM becomes increasingly important for new infotainment and ADAS systems. We continue to have leading industry share in automotive. Before talking about the market outlook, I want to provide an update on our business with Huawei and the ongoing impact of trade uncertainties. As we noted last quarter, we started shipping some products to Huawei that are not subject to Export Administration Regulations and Entity List restrictions. In the fiscal fourth quarter, sales to Huawei declined sequentially and were down meaningfully from the levels we anticipated prior to the addition of Huawei to the Entity List. We have applied for licenses with the Department of Commerce that would allow us to ship additional products, but there have been no decisions on licenses to date. We see ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade negotiations. If the Entity List restrictions against Huawei continue and we are unable to get licenses, we could see a worsening decline in our sales to Huawei over the coming quarters. Now turning to our market outlook, which assumes that the macroeconomic environment doesn't materially deteriorate from current levels. I'll begin with our industry outlook and then turn to Micron's outlook for DRAM and NAND. The DRAM and NAND industry demand growth in the second half of calendar 2019 compared to the first half is primarily being driven by a normalization of inventories at most customers and secular growth trends in various end markets. In recent months, we have seen increased demand from customers headquartered in Mainland China, some of whom could be making strategic decisions to build higher levels of inventory in the face of increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well as Japan and Korea. Our view of calendar 2019 DRAM industry bit demand growth remains unchanged at mid-teens, with supply exceeding demand due to previously discussed factors that impacted first half calendar 2019 demand. Based on our early view of calendar 2020, we expect the industry to see bit demand growth of high teens to 20%, above supply growth of only mid-teens, which should help normalize supplier inventories and enable a healthy industry environment. We expect the long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR to be mid to high teens. Turning to NAND industry outlook, demand elasticity and industry supply reductions are resulting in improving market conditions and declining industry inventory. On the supply side, CapEx and wafer start cuts across the industry are leading to supply reductions. A power outage at a competitor's fab also reduced industry supply and inventory. We now expect calendar 2019 industry bit demand growth in the low to mid-40% range, which will exceed industry bit supply growth of approximately 30%. Based on our view of calendar 2020, we estimate industry bit demand growth of high 20s to low 30% range, with supply growing somewhat below demand. We believe that NAND industry margins, which are at the lowest levels in the last 10 years, should start increasing for the rest of the year. We expect the long-term NAND bit demand growth CAGR to be in the low 30% range. Specific to Micron's DRAM outlook, we are seeing solid demand from customers across multiple segments. This is improving our inventory, and we have started to see pockets of tight supply, particularly in leading-edge nodes. However, we still have elevated inventory levels on older nodes. As a result, we are continuing with the previously disclosed DRAM wafer start reductions of 5%. We expect Micron's calendar 2019 bit supply growth to be slightly below industry demand growth of mid-teens and expect our calendar 2020 DRAM bit supply growth to be close to the market demand growth. We also expect our DRAM cost reductions to moderate in fiscal 2020 to high single digits. As we have said before, the increasing complexity of more advanced DRAM nodes is resulting in slower pace of cost declines for the industry. As our DRAM inventory improves, we are committed to maintaining price discipline. While we are having to respond to some aggressive market pricing, we have started walking away from some transactions as we look to optimize our profitability. Turning to Micron's NAND outlook, we expect our calendar 2019 bit growth to be slightly above industry supply growth, and in calendar 2020, we expect Micron's bit supply growth to be significantly below the industry demand growth as we transition a limited portion of our wafer starts to our first-generation replacement gate node and use inventory to support customer demand. Supply growth will also be impacted by our previously announced wafer start reductions of approximately 10%. We are seeing some capacity tightness in our back-end manufacturing operations due to significant increases in demand for high-capacity NAND products. This is another data point of elasticity kicking in on high-value NAND solutions. While NAND and DRAM market conditions are showing some promising signs, in order to bring our supply in line with the market demand, we are targeting our fiscal 2020 front-end equipment CapEx to be reduced by more than 30% from fiscal 2019. Our CapEx decision is also influenced by macroeconomic uncertainty and low industry profitability. Our front-end CapEx outlook reflects our strategy for limited ramp of our first RG node. While we are reducing front-end equipment CapEx, we are spending significantly more on shell space to enable future node transitions and also investing in a new SSD packaging facility in Penang, Malaysia. As always, we will maintain flexibility and discipline while investing appropriately for Micron's long-term success. I want to emphasize that our goal is to manage our DRAM and NAND bit supply growth CAGR in line with industry demand. As we catch up on the technology and cost gaps to best-in-class competitors in DRAM and transition to RG technology in NAND, our supply growth may fluctuate, but we expect the medium to long-term growth rate of our supply to approximately equal the rate of demand growth across both NAND and DRAM markets. We are also focused on maximizing the ROI of our CapEx investments, and for this reason, we are not emphasizing wafer capacity growth, but instead focusing on bit growth driven by technology transitions. In addition, some of our CapEx is dedicated to increasing our internal capacity for assembly, packaging and test, which helps us drive cost reductions without adding any bit growth and has good ROI. I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance. Thanks, Sanjay. As Sanjay mentioned, Micron delivered resilient performance throughout a challenging year for the industry, highlighted by fiscal Q4 results that exceeded our guided ranges for revenue and earnings. As market conditions evolved during the year, we curtailed our planned operating expenses and capital expenditures, allowing us to preserve margins and generate healthy free cash flow. We achieved our first corporate investment-grade rating, strengthened our balance sheet and meaningfully reduced our share count. All in all, fiscal 2019 was a year of stellar progress that sets Micron up for attractive growth as industry conditions recover. Turning to our recent financial results. Total fiscal Q4 revenue was approximately $4.9 billion. Revenue was up 2% sequentially and down 42% year-over-year. Revenue exceeded our guidance range largely due to better-than-expected demand. Full fiscal 2019 revenue totaled $23.4 billion, down 23% year-over-year. Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $3.1 billion, representing 63% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 1% sequentially and declined 48% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew approximately 30% sequentially and in the mid-teens percent range year-on-year as customer inventories improved significantly. ASP declined approximately 20% sequentially. For full fiscal 2019, DRAM revenue was $15.2 billion, down 28% from fiscal 2018 as bits grew in the low single digit percent range and ASP declined approximately 30%. Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was approximately $1.5 billion or 31% of total revenue. Revenue was up 5% sequentially, but declined 32% year-on-year. Bit shipments grew in the low to mid-teens percent range sequentially. ASP declined in the upper single digit percent range. We're starting to see supply tightness in portions of the NAND market and prices are beginning to increase. Full fiscal 2019 NAND revenue was $6.9 billion, down 12% from fiscal 2018 as ASP declines of mid-40s percent range more than offset strong bit shipment growth. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $1.9 billion in fiscal Q4, a decline of 8% sequentially and down 56% year-over-year. ASP declines across most segments continue to be the leading cause of lower revenue. For the fiscal year, revenue was $10 billion, down 35% year-over-year. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit in fiscal Q4 was $1.4 billion, up 20% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Both DRAM and NAND bits had strong growth driven by seasonality and continued content growth in smartphones. Our mobile business gained share in the year driven by a stronger product portfolio. For the full fiscal year, MBU revenue was $6.4 billion, down only 3% from fiscal 2018. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit in fiscal Q4 was $848 million, an increase of 4% from fiscal Q3 and down 32% year-over-year. For the fiscal year, SBU revenue was $3.8 billion, down 24% from fiscal 2018. And finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $705 million in fiscal Q4, up 1% from fiscal Q3 and down 24% from the prior year. For the fiscal year, EBU revenue was $3.1 billion, down 10% from fiscal 2018. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q4 was 30.6%, above our guidance range due to our strong execution, improving demand and slightly better pricing. Q4 gross margins included approximately 200 basis point negative impact or approximately $100 million due to the underutilization charges at IMFT. Starting in fiscal Q1 and continuing for the foreseeable future, we expect to incur an underutilization impact of approximately $150 million per quarter, with about half the impact consisting of noncash items. Over time, as our 3D XPoint business ramps, this underutilization impact will be mitigated. But as you can expect, it takes time to commercialize a new breakthrough technology. Meanwhile, we will continue to look for ways to optimize our costs and will provide updates on material progress over time. With respect to U.S. tariffs on imports from China, with continued mitigation, we were able to contain their impact on our consolidated gross margin in fiscal Q4 to less than 20 basis points. Operating expenses were $797 million and included some onetime expenses. We continue to control our expenses tightly, and our SG&A as a percent of revenue is meaningfully lower than our competitors. Fiscal Q4 operating income was $694 million, representing 14% of revenue. Operating margin was down 38 percentage points year-over-year and down 9 percentage points from fiscal Q3. Our full fiscal 2019 operating income was $7.8 billion or 33% of our fiscal year revenue. Our fiscal Q4 effective tax rate was 8.8%. For the fiscal year, our effective tax rate was approximately 7.3%, which included the tax benefit we recorded in fiscal Q3. Going forward, we expect our tax rate to be mid to high single digits. Non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal Q4 were $0.56, down from $1.05 in fiscal Q3 and $3.53 in the year ago quarter. For full fiscal 2019, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $6.35, down from $11.95 in fiscal 2018. Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $2.2 billion in cash from operations in fiscal Q4, representing 46% of revenue. For full fiscal 2019, cash from operations was $13.2 billion, representing 56% of revenue, down from $17.4 billion or 57% of revenue in fiscal 2018. Cash flow margins remained almost flat due to effective working capital management. During the quarter, net capital spending was approximately $2 billion, down from $2.2 billion in the prior quarter. For full fiscal 2019, our net CapEx was $9.1 billion, up from $8.2 billion in fiscal 2018, but down meaningfully from the $10 billion to $11 billion plan we originally had entering fiscal 2019. We expect our fiscal 2020 net CapEx to be in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion, down meaningfully from fiscal 2019. We expect that CapEx for buildings and back-end manufacturing will increase significantly from last year, while the front-end equipment CapEx will decline more than 30% year-on-year. Looking at cash generation, we generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $260 million in fiscal Q4 compared to $500 million in fiscal Q3 and $3.1 billion in the year ago quarter. Adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2019 was $4.1 billion, down from $9.2 billion in fiscal 2018. We received notice for approximately $180 million of convertible note redemptions in the quarter, which will remove approximately 4 million shares from our ongoing share count in fiscal Q1. For full fiscal 2019, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks, representing 65% of free cash flow, at an average purchase price of $40. Including these share repurchases and our convertible note redemptions, we reduced our average diluted share count by 80 million shares in fiscal 2019, representing 7% of shares outstanding. We remain committed to returning at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases in the future. Days of inventory was 131, down from 143 days in fiscal Q3. Inventory ended the quarter at $5.1 billion, increasing from $4.9 billion at the end of fiscal Q3. We will continue to focus on reducing our days of inventory and expect to see further reduction in fiscal Q1. As mentioned before, we are seeing pockets of tight supply in certain parts of our business. Our long-term normalized inventory target has increased over time to above 100 days as a result of greater process complexity and the broadening of our product portfolio to high-value solutions, such as SSDs that require longer assembly and test cycle time. Total cash ended the quarter at $9.2 billion, up quarter-over-quarter, largely as a result of our $1.75 billion investment-grade debt issuance. Our total debt increased to $5.9 billion. Total liquidity ended fiscal Q4 at $13 billion. We are holding approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity for the acquisition of the IMFT joint venture expected in fiscal Q1 '20. This acquisition will eliminate approximately $700 million of member debt financing and will be funded by drawing down $1.25 billion from our term loan facility secured in fiscal Q4. Before moving on to guidance, I want to share some expected changes to our upcoming reporting. We continue to evaluate planned technology node transitions, capital spending and reuse rates for NAND equipment. Based on our preliminary assessment, we anticipate changing the depreciable life of our NAND equipment from 5 to 7 years beginning in fiscal Q1 '20. This change will reduce our depreciation expense included in cost of goods sold for Q1 by approximately $80 million and increasing to approximately $100 million to $150 million per quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, depreciable life for DRAM equipment is already 7 years. Also starting in Q1, we expect to change how we report MCP revenue, which we currently include within NAND revenue. We will begin disaggregating MCP revenue into DRAM and NAND, which will reduce our reported NAND revenue and margins in FQ1 while increasing our DRAM revenue. We believe that this change will help improve the transparency of our DRAM and NAND businesses. Now turning to our financial outlook. As our portfolio strengthens and we improve our share in high-value segments, we're seeing growing demand for both DRAM and NAND and this is creating pockets of supply shortages, particularly in some leading-edge nodes and back-end manufacturing. However, the market remains competitive and industry inventories continue to adjust to economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Notwithstanding these challenges, we expect bit shipments for both DRAM and NAND to grow in fiscal Q1, with NAND increasing more than DRAM. With that in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $5 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 26.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $780 million, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.13 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.46, plus or minus $0.07. Despite a variety of industry and trade-related challenges in fiscal 2019, Micron delivered strong financial results. At our 2018 Analyst Day, we laid out how we believed Micron was structurally improved and able to weather the storm in even challenging periods for the industry. While we're not out of the woods, we are proud of our execution as we have moved through the current cycle. We are exiting the fiscal year with a stronger product portfolio, deeper customer relationships and our highest liquidity and net cash position to date, and we have also made good progress on our share buyback program. We are well positioned to emerge from the current cycle ready to capitalize on the secular growth trends driving our business. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for concluding remarks. Thank you, Dave. Fiscal 2019 has been a solid year of accomplishments for the New Micron, as we continue to focus on structural improvements across a range of functions in the company, to take our performance to new heights. While we have made dramatic progress over the last couple of years, there is significant opportunity ahead of us to further improve our operations, drive product cost reductions, further improve engineering execution, build on our go-to-market strategy and initiatives, deepen customer engagements and enhance the core competitiveness of the company to best-in-class levels. As we look ahead, the long-term opportunities are exciting, and we are extremely enthusiastic about the momentum we have established at the New Micron. On October 24, we'll be hosting our second annual Micron Insight event, which will bring together leaders from across the industry to discuss how a world activated by data can transform the way we use information to enrich life and how memory and storage are vital to these efforts. We will be webcasting Micron Insight live from San Francisco, and I encourage you all to tune in. We will now open for questions.","I think certainly the pickup in business is being driven by the industry fundamentals. I would just like to remind you that in the first half of calendar 2019 because of the inventory that the customers have built or had built up the demand to the producers was low yet the end-market demand for all applications continue to be robust. And now as the customers have worked down their inventory to normal levels, the demand is coming back to the producers. And as a result, you saw in our calendar Q, I mean, fiscal Q4 results our strong growth in DRAM bit as well as NAND. And second half is the demand is back, the customer demand is back, and yes, there may be some level of inventory build in China due to the reasons that I've mentioned by certain customers, but I'll tell you that we do not think that, that inventory build is anywhere close to the kind of inventory build that had gone on in the second half of last year. So nowhere materially close to that level. So overall, the industry environment in terms of demand return is certainly solid. Certainly, in DRAM, there is still some supply, excess supply with the producers, but the inventory is improving fast. We talked about our inventory actually improving faster than what we perhaps anticipated some time ago and overall we even see some shortages in some leading-edge products, particularly on the DRAM side. So overall, we think that industry inventory at the producers is being consumed at a rapid clip. The demand trends are back to normal levels. And especially when you look at the trends of through next year, 5G, you look at smartphone average capacities continuing to increase, both for NAND and DRAM, and cloud demand drivers continuing to be solid, new platforms, new CPU architectures being used that allow greater use and higher use of DRAM capacities as well as there are applications driving more DRAM and NAND. So the demand trends, when I look at 2020, I believe that the industry demand/supply environment will be in a lot healthier place. Yes, maybe calendar Q1 may have some cyclicality, but the industry fundamentals overall from demand/supply point of view I think in 2020 will be in a much healthier place. Another way to look at this and kind of back it up mathematically is if you look at the year-over-year bit growth in the fourth quarter. It's only in the kind of 14% kind of range. So that kind of backs up the idea that this is really about industry fundamentals more so than it is about stocking inventory. Okay. So yes let me kind of walk through a little bit of the puts and takes. Obviously, pricing is a factor in the expectations around gross margins for the first fiscal quarter. And of course, we don't talk necessarily about forward pricing. But the second piece is cost. And as Sanjay mentioned, our cost declines for fiscal '20 in total will be kind of high single digits. That's lower than the cost declines we got in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. And so we are seeing a slower rate of cost declines for DRAM and that's, of course, something we've indicated was coming given the complexities that we face and as we migrate nodes. And as we talked about, obviously, on the NAND side, we're going to have very minimal cost declines as we kind of transition to replacement gate. So those are certainly factors in that. And I would tell you that the first quarter cost declines are very minimal. The third piece is mix. If you look at the mix from just a move to high-value solutions that, of course, is positive, but what is overshadowing that is the mix of NAND and DRAM. And of course, NAND has a lower gross margin than DRAM. And we will see likely a higher mix of NAND next quarter, which will affect gross margins negatively. And then as you pointed out, there's 2 kind of unusual items, I guess, in the quarter. One is the change in the useful life of NAND equipment. That will be positive, but more than half of that will be offset by underutilization expenses associated with IMFT. So those are kind of all the puts and takes of gross margins. I think it's likely that it will be a little higher from Q1 to Q2 in terms of underutilization expenses, but it was somewhat in the noise. We might be a little bit lower than $150 million of underutilization expense in fiscal Q1 and we might be a little higher than that in fiscal Q2. Well, I think clearly we're talking about NAND getting better. And we are seeing the early signs in DRAM of kind of the fundamentals getting better, demand is coming back, inventories on our balance sheet and on the industry's balance sheets are coming down. Of course, that hasn't gotten completely to where it needs to be. And also Sanjay mentioned in his prepared remarks the market continues to be a bit competitive. And so we'll have to see when that, all those things come together and supply kind of aligns with demand to drive a more healthier market for DRAM. We definitely have some underutilization expenses in DRAM. Certainly, we have that built into our expectations for the first fiscal quarter. It may last into the second fiscal quarter. And so that certainly is an impact. But I would tell you that over time, as complexity of these nodes goes up and as capital intensity goes up, the cost declines are going to become more challenging. So the high single digit will probably not be something we can routinely do year-to-year. And I'll just add that we are certainly narrowing the cost gap in terms of DRAM production cost overall. 1Z node is a good example of Micron's leadership, being the first one to introduce the 1Z node with the smallest feature size in the industry and the result of cost improvement that we are making on DRAM as well as, of course, the high-value solutions that are driving higher mix on the NAND side is a major improvement, 2,500-plus basis point improvement in our EBITDA margins versus the competition compared to the past 2016 time frame. So Dave will comment on your inventory part of the question, but let me just address your question on the 96 layers. As we have said before, 96-layer execution has gone very well with the company. In terms of yield ramp, 96-layer technology has given us the fastest yield ramp of any other NAND technologies in the past. So we are very proud of that accomplishment and 96-layer is continuing to ramp during the course of our fiscal year 2020. In fact, 96-layer will be the major driver of our NAND bit growth in fiscal year 2020. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with respect to replacement gate, we have seen now functionality and yielding dies. We are certainly quite encouraged by that and continue to work on technology and product development. In fiscal year 2020, 64-layer and 96-layer will continue to be the workhorse technologies and our replacement gate technology, of course, will have a small mix in fiscal year '20 and for us as well. Keep in mind, our first replacement gate node, which will have small production in fiscal year '20, will be a rather limited node because we'll be deploying it across select set of products. It's our second-generation node which will, of course, come in the subsequent fiscal year that will position us well and resume the year-over-year strong cost reductions for us. But basically, the 96-layer will continue to ramp during fiscal year '20 for us. Okay. So on the inventory question. So we had 143 days of inventory in the third quarter. That came down to 131 days in the fourth fiscal quarter. If you kind of break that out between DRAM and NAND, DRAM was meaningfully below that and NAND was meaningfully above that. I would say in terms of days. Obviously, in absolute dollars, DRAM has more inventory than NAND. I would say, you've got to remember there are 2 reasons why inventory was building for NAND. It was building as we kind of slowed down our supply, but customers were working down their inventory. Now the adjustments we've made to our supply, both in terms of capital spending reductions and in terms of utilization adjustments, we have brought our inventory down pretty meaningfully this quarter. We expect to bring it down again meaningfully next quarter. On the NAND side, we have elevated levels of inventory, but that's more strategic. What we're trying to do is have some built up inventory in fiscal '19 that we can use in fiscal '20 to support the RG transition because the replacement gate transition will not drive a lot of bit growth. And so in order to support the increased demand next year, we will have to utilize this inventory for that purpose. So in terms of overall bits, with respect to DRAM growth in terms of revenue, I mean, it has primarily been impacted by the customer inventories that were built up last year for the first half. And our overall DRAM shipments are in line with overall the industry in this regard. And I think what we said is that the industry demand mid-teens and our overall supply growth during the calendar '19 to be slightly below the industry, of course, as a result some of the underutilization actions that we have taken. And of course, there is an impact of Huawei in terms of our overall business. We have said before that compared to the levels that we anticipated before Huawei's placement on the entity listing, our revenue is lower. And of course, we are very much focused on continuing to diversify our revenue base. But yes, I mean, the Huawei entity listing does have an effect on some of our shipments to the customer. I mean, some of our overall shipments in the market. This is really related to some of our overall production and mix. And some of the older nodes have lower demand compared to our total supply available and therefore, that's where we are primarily running underutilization on the DRAM side. So it really is about the overall demand and this is good inventory that will overall will get consumed over time. Yes. It was a little bit lower than the $2 billion number, but certainly a meaningful part of our spend. And you could probably parse out from what Sanjay said. We expect that number to increase in fiscal '20 and the opposite is we expect the front-end equipment spend to decrease in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019. We'll obviously make another investment in the back end and we're expecting that to be roughly similar to what we're spending or what we spent in fiscal 2019. We don't tend to break that out, but I guess I would just tell you that our plan is to reduce front-end equipment spend in both DRAM and NAND next year. So with respect to the NAND demand trend in calendar year 2020, I mean, just keep in mind that in calendar 2018 the industry grew by approximately 45%, in calendar year '19 again by about 45% or so, low 40s to 45%. And that then definitely, I mean, when you look at a multiyear CAGR, I think it does lead to calendar year '20 to be approximately in low 30s or in that range, high 20s to low 30s kind of range in terms of calendar year '20. And I think what you have to realize is that with such aggressive pricing decline that had occurred in NAND over 2018 and 2019 time frame, elasticity definitely has kicked in substantially. And as we said, pricing environment actually has started improving in NAND. And some of the average capacity growth that you perhaps would have seen next year actually has been pulled in faster into this year as a result of some of these aggressive price declines that have occurred and have driven the usage of higher capacities in terms of increasing average capacities of SSDs, increasing the attach rate of SSDs as well as continuing to drive higher average capacities in the smartphone market as well. So these are some of the factors that are absolutely playing an important role in terms of our assessment that for calendar year '20, the year-over-year bit growth will be high 20s to low 30s range. Again, keep in mind that we still are a few months away from next calendar year and we, of course, will continue to assess the overall industry demand trend, but this is our latest projection on that. Your first question was around cloud and let me just point out that cloud definitely demand grew nicely for us on the DRAM side in FQ4, strong demand increase there. And yes, the cloud demand from time to time can be somewhat lumpy. However, overall, demand growth trends on the cloud side continue to be solid. In fact, we see cloud demand consumption, both for DRAM as well as for SSDs continue to be higher than the average of the respective DRAM and the NAND industries. So overall, cloud, again, new architectures, new CPU platforms that are really enabling more channels as well as usage of higher density of DRAMs as well as again, as I spoke earlier, the trend of AI applications, all of this is driving greater usage of memory and storage in cloud. So cloud, we see as absolutely strong. Cloud customers' inventories have normalized and it's back to normal levels. Other than any aspects perhaps in China, as I talked about, of maybe some element of strategic inventory build by certain customers. But overall, the cloud demand trends are solid. So I think in fiscal '20, the main focus for us on NAND will be to continue to increase the mix of high-value solutions. I think in mobile, you have seen us increase managed NAND solutions in terms of share gains substantially. And I reported in my prepared remarks on the tremendous progress that we have made with our mobile business. And most of it driven by the progress on the managed NAND side. And we plan to continue to increase that part of the business in fiscal year 2020. I also spoke about SSDs. SSD was certainly a headwind in terms of share opportunities for us in fiscal year '19. And as we now have expanded our portfolio of NVMe solutions actually have introduced our first NVMe solutions during fiscal year '19 now. We can leverage those solutions to expand our opportunities in fiscal year 2020. And we certainly look forward to resuming gaining share in SSD on fiscal year '20. So I think that those are the important pieces of our strategy of continuing to drive healthier revenue mix of NAND in fiscal year 2020. And of course, we are extremely focused on cost reductions on assembly, test and nonmemory BOM as well which are important factors particularly when it comes to products like SSDs or multichip packages, et cetera. And we are making good progress on cost reductions on nonmemory part of the BOM as well. So these are all opportunities for us in fiscal year '20, but no question that at the die level our cost reduction capabilities will be overall limited in terms of the cost reductions due to the RG transition that we talked about earlier. I think on the smartphone side, the average DRAM content if you look at it this year, it increased by nearly 25%, slightly above 3 gigabyte was the average capacity. Last year, expected to be in calendar year '19 around 4 and a pretty similar double-digit gains continuing. 5G, if you look at Mobile World Congress, phones that were introduced there were 8-gigabyte and 12-gigabyte DRAM density in those phones. So as 5G phones start selling in the marketplace, some of those phones are already introduced in the market today in some parts of the world and this will continue to build momentum during calendar year '20 and years beyond. Those phones will also require more DRAM. And again, the phones are becoming more and more feature-rich. More AI applications are being built into the smartphones today and rich video and imaging capability and a lot more intelligence behind all those applications. They require more DRAM as well. So looking at next year, we will certainly be seeing continuing average capacity increases next year as well. In fact, in calendar year 2020, if you look at industry projections, average capacity is expected to increase another 20% next year going to something closer to 5-gigabyte per smartphone. But as I said before, the DRAM is not only about smartphone. It's other applications related to server as well where the average content continues to increase as well as the average content continues to increase in PCs as well with applications such as gaming driving higher need for more DRAM.","So then to talk a little bit about your customers' inventory levels. One of the big concerns or debates in the financial community at the moment is whether the pickup in memory volumes that I think Micron has seen, is that mostly being driven by fundamentals or is this just potential inventory stocking because of some of the trade concerns? And Sanjay, I think you maybe talked about a bit of both factors in your prepared comments and some potential inventory stocking but also inventory coming down in some important markets like data center. So maybe you can just kind of level set and put those things together and do you think the pickup in your business, is it primarily being driven by fundamentals or how much of this is maybe some of that inventory stocking because of trade concerns? Congratulations on the solid results given the macro uncertainty. Sanjay, I just have several questions just around the guided gross margins for the fiscal first quarter. If you look at the incremental hit you keep getting from IMFT that, that's more than offset by kind of the change in depreciation and yet you're still kind of getting sort of a 400 basis point drop sequentially in gross margin on kind of flattish to up revenue. And I know you guys don't comment about future pricing, but can you talk about other puts and takes around mix that might be negatively impacting kind of the gross margin? And I guess given that the incremental cost of IMFT is probably driven by you taking receipt of the whole joint venture in the month of November, why wouldn't that hit get higher as you go into the fiscal second quarter and have it for the full quarter? I just wanted to have a poke again around the gross margin question that was just asked. But one of the bigger questions I have was just your commentary about pricing getting better, but then you're talking about gross margins going down on a higher revenue base. So if you offset that with depreciation as well, I mean, does that imply that November quarter should be the bottom for gross margins or are you guys implying that February can also be down sequentially? On your fiscal '20 DRAM outlook for high single digits cost reductions versus fiscal '19, is that how we should think about your longer-term annualized cost down profile given the higher complexity, capital intensity that you outlined or are there some impacts from the pullback in utilizations, drawdown of your own inventories and/or maybe a slower 1Z transition that's impacting the cost down profile as well? You talk about inventory down quite a bit Q-on-Q. You gave some numbers on that. Do you have an even more break down on how that compares DRAM versus NAND? And then looking forward to next-gen technology, you commented that it's quite difficult transition to replacement gate NAND. Can you give an update on the timing for that, where you are on the 96 layers for your current generation in terms of percentage of the output and give a little bit more detail on the timing for the ramp of replacement gate. I just wanted to hit on your commentary around DRAM and undergrowing the industry in calendar '19. Within that, is that largely driven by Huawei, perhaps more aggressive competitors in certain markets, change in mix? Would love to hear your thoughts on that. And then as we move into calendar '20, what are your expectations vis-à-vis the market for your market share? You had mentioned that you did see some elevated inventory levels in the lower process node. I was wondering if you can kind of elaborate on that particular comment. I was wondering if you could help me parse out the CapEx guidance a little bit more in detail. I know last quarter relative to the $9.1 billion you did for the full year, you talked about roughly $2 billion for kind of cleanroom and facility kind of CapEx. Was that the case? And I think on the basis of that, what is that kind of CapEx spend specifically embedded in your fiscal '20 guidance? Just wondering on the same CapEx line, I know you guys talked about equipment CapEx being down 30%. So looks like close to $5 billion for fiscal '20, just wondering what the split would be on NAND and DRAM. Two follow-ups. We talked about the demand trends are positive, but I want to get a better assessment of how do you see data centers. There has been some conversation in industry that data center demand is seasonal. Some argue that it is better than seasonal. Sanjay, I want to get your view, how do you see the data center demand for both SSDs and server DRAM is tracking? And in that context, I'm surprised with your NAND bit demand projection for next year. This is well below historical trend of near 40%. What do you attribute this NAND demand trend into 2020 which in my opinion is well below trend line. Sorry to get back to NAND for fiscal '20 and I just wanted to reconcile the comments you made and I wanted to make sure I'm walking away with the right take away, is that you have limited cost down. And  then you talked about very low gross margin. And you're also selling from already build inventory. So what's the trade-off between all these factors as I compare your profitability in NAND versus competition in fiscal '20? Great. Yes. I wonder if you could talk about if your forecasted demand will accelerate next year on the DRAM side. Can you kind of break that down between units and content and just generally what's your expectation for DRAM content for smartphones and servers next year?

Good afternoon, everyone. I hope that you, your family and your colleagues are safe and healthy. Along with Dave and Farhan, I'm doing this call from Micron’s offices. Micron’s strong execution in the fiscal third quarter drove solid sequential revenue and EPS growth. We are ramping the industry’s most advanced DRAM node and increasing our mix of high-value NAND. Our strong competitive position and diversified product portfolio put Micron in an outstanding position for the Many exciting growth opportunities in the memory and storage markets. I'll start with an update on our operations. Due to the excellent work of Micron's operations team, most of our fab and assembly sites operated at full production throughout the quarter, with our Singapore and Taiwan assembly and test facilities achieving record production. COVID-19's impact to our production early in our third quarter was limited to our back-end assembly and test sites in Muar and Penang, Malaysia, and we quickly offset this impact with production adjustments at our other facilities. All our production facilities are operating normally at this time. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of all team members and contractors and have strong COVID-19 safety measures in place at all our sites worldwide. We are taking a conservative, phased and site-specific approach to returning our team members on-site, prioritizing our manufacturing workforce and engineering teams. Now turning to the market environment. The pandemic has impacted the cyclical recovery in DRAM and NAND, causing stronger demand in some segments and weaker demand in others. Market segments driven primarily by consumer demand have seen a negative impact. Calendar 2020 analyst estimates for end-unit sales of autos, smartphones and PCs are meaningfully lower than pre-COVID-19 levels, even though estimates for enterprise laptops and Chromebooks have increased. The reduced level of global economic activity has also curtailed near-term demand. The pandemic is driving rapid change in consumer and corporate practices around the world. Consumers are significantly increasing online activity, including e-commerce, gaming and video streaming, all of which drive additional data center capacity requirements. Trends like working-from-home and online learning are likely to drive long-term changes in how we think about workforce flexibility and education. Several governments around the world are considering ways to ensure a level playing field by considering significant programs that provide Chromebooks or tablets to students who cannot afford them, as online learning becomes a necessity in these times. Additional government fiscal stimulus programs are also supportive of economic activity and will accelerate trends like electric vehicle production. Emerging technologies such as drone-based deliveries and the increased use of robotics across many applications are now being pursued with urgency. Technology solutions are rapidly helping society adapt and manage the temporary and permanent changes stemming from this pandemic. Clearly, certain trends that would have taken 2 to 4 years to develop have been accelerated into months. It is easy to see how these changes will drive higher consumption of memory and storage in the long term. The faster pace of digital transformation in the economy is here to stay. Looking ahead to the second half of calendar 2020, let me discuss certain key market trends. First, we expect the data center outlook to remain healthy. Second, we expect smartphone and consumer end-unit sales to continue to improve, accelerating inventory consumption across the supply chain. And third, new gaming consoles will drive stronger DRAM and NAND demand. Despite these trends, our short-term visibility across end markets remains limited due to COVID-19, macro and trade uncertainties, as well as customer inventory changes. The recent restrictions on Huawei are also impacting our opportunity in the near term. As these risks recede, we expect a resumption of industry growth, with a long-term bit growth CAGR of mid to high-teens for DRAM and approximately 30% for NAND. This growth will be supported by powerful secular technology trends ranging from AI and machine learning, to cloud computing, 5G and the growth in edge computing and the industrial IoT economy. Turning to industry supply, second-half 2020 supply growth may be somewhat muted compared to pre-COVID-19 expectations. Some suppliers have commented about delays in equipment deliveries, which can result in slower node transitions and lower bit growth. Specific to Micron, we are proactively aligning our bit supply to market demand. Our fiscal year '20 front-end equipment CapEx is down more than 40% from fiscal year '19 and is at its lowest level in the last 5 years. While we expect to increase fiscal year '21 CapEx to support high-ROIC node transition, this CapEx will be meaningfully lower than our pre-COVID-19 plan. We have also made changes to our DRAM utilization to align with the current lower demand in the automotive market. As end market conditions evolve, we will remain flexible to make any needed adjustments to our supply. Since 2016, Micron has made tremendous progress narrowing the competitive gap on leading-edge technology nodes. In DRAM, we are ramping 1Z technology, which is the industry's most advanced node, and achieving yield improvements that reduce our costs. We have several customer qualifications underway for this technology. Our 1Y and 1Z nodes together now make up more than 50% of our bit production. We continue to make progress on our 1-alpha node, which we expect to introduce in fiscal 2021. We have begun sampling our first high-bandwidth DRAM memory product, which is competitive with the industry's most advanced products and will expand our AI data center opportunity. We are excited about entering this new high-value segment of the DRAM market and look forward to ramping this product after it is qualified with our customers. In NAND, our 128-layer first generation RG NAND technology entered volume production in FQ3, and we are pleased to announce that we have recently initiated customer shipment. We are also making good progress on our second-generation RG node, which will be deployed broadly across our product portfolio. We remain on track for RG production to make a meaningful portion of our NAND output by the end of calendar 2020. Micron also continues to make progress with QLC. QLC bits now represents more than 10% of Micron's overall NAND production, contributing to our NAND cost improvement. Fiscal 2020 has been a year of extraordinary gains in the mix of our high-value solutions in NAND, which now make up over 75% of our quarterly NAND bit. We remain on target to increase this to 80% for fiscal 2021. The new Micron is undergoing a dramatic transformation to combine product leadership with technology, manufacturing and supply chain excellence. Across our entire portfolio of DRAM and NAND products, we will continue to focus on product differentiation and portfolio expansion to grow our share of industry profits while maintaining stable bit share. Turning to end markets. We had record quarterly revenue in solid-state drives as cloud SSD revenue more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. We continue to introduce new NVMe products in our SSD portfolio while maintaining our leadership in the enterprise SATA market. Customer qualifications are progressing well for our next-generation products for both NVMe and SATA markets. Our client NVMe SSDs have also contributed to our SSD growth. In May, we announced a TLC client SSD and our first QLC client SSD, both using next-generation 96-layer NAND technology. As the only company with a portfolio of DRAM, NAND and 3D XPoint technologies, Micron is uniquely positioned to benefit from the secular data growth that is driving the cloud, enterprise and networking market. Our cloud DRAM sales grew significantly quarter-over-quarter, with strong demand due to the work from home and e-learning economy and significant increases in e-commerce activity around the world. This quarter, we started early sampling of 1Z DDR5 for enterprise application. Additionally, we also started sampling our higher-frequency DDR4 modules for Intel's Ice Lake server platform, which we expect to drive server DRAM content growth. In networking, our DRAM bit shipments expanded significantly on a sequential basis, driven by rapid work-from-home infrastructure deployment as well as increased 5G deployments, particularly in Asia. Despite demand headwinds in the smartphone market due to COVID, our mobile business delivered healthy sequential and year-over-year growth due to continuing momentum of our DRAM and NAND solution. The outlook for calendar 2021 is promising, with 5G expected to drive a resumption in smartphone unit sales growth with the multiplier effect of higher memory and storage content. 5G phones will have greater content than 4G phone, and we can see this already in the phones being introduced in calendar 2020. We see the strongest memory and storage content growth in the low- to mid-range part of the smart home market, which is also the largest segment in terms of units. In this part of the market, 5G phones have 6 gigabyte of DRAM and 64 and 128 gigabyte of NAND versus 4G phones with 2 to 4 gigabyte of DRAM and 32 to 64 gigabytes of NAND. We are encouraged to see sub-$250 5G phones, which made 5G accessible to a broader market. This lower price point has been enabled by BOM cost reductions in semiconductor content outside of memory and storage. Micron is well positioned to help our customers win in the 5G era with an industry-leading product portfolio, including low-power DRAM and multichip packages. We continue to achieve design wins for LP4 and LP5 5G platforms, and our most advanced managed NAND products based on UFS 3.1 are now sampling at several major android OEMs. In PC, our bit shipments declined modestly as we strategically moved supply of compute data to address demand in the data center market. Demand was strong for certain PC subsegments that are supporting increased work from home and remote learning activities, and our PC DRAM revenue was up sequentially as ASPs increased. While certain parts of the PC market has strengthened, overall PC unit shipments are expected to decline this year due to weakness in desktop PCs. In graphics, we have started shipping GDDR6 DRAM for next-generation gaming consoles, and we expect strong demand in the second half of calendar 2020. In auto, revenue declined significantly from the previous quarter due to broad auto supply chain disruption. Despite auto unit weakness, secular content growth from ADAS and autonomous driving platforms resulted in record LP4 DRAM revenue for our auto business in the fiscal third quarter. As automotive production rates improve around the world, our auto business should return to a growth trajectory. I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance. Thanks, Sanjay. Despite COVID-19, we achieved strong results, thanks to resilient execution from our team members across the globe. Total FQ3 revenue was approximately $5.4 billion, up 13% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth was led by the data center and mobile markets. FQ3 DRAM revenue was $3.6 billion, representing 66% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 16% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Bit shipments were up by approximately 10% sequentially. ASPs were up sequentially in the mid-single-digit percentage range. FQ3 NAND revenue was approximately $1.7 billion, representing 31% of total revenue. NAND revenue increased 10% sequentially and was up over 50% year-over-year. Bit shipments increased in the lower single-digit percentage range sequentially. ASPs increased sequentially in the upper single-digit percentage range. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $2.2 billion, up 13% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. CNBU's sequential growth was driven by double-digit quarter-over-quarter pricing improvements and stronger demand for data center products. We were supply constrained for certain compute DRAM products, which limited our ability to meet some demand upside from customers. Revenue for the mobile business unit was $1.5 billion, up 21% sequentially and up 30% year-over-year. The sequential growth was primarily driven by strong growth in our LPDRAM bit shipments. MCP revenue remained strong and was up significantly year-over-year. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit in FQ3 was $1 billion, up 17% from FQ2 and up 25% year-over-year. SBU operating margins increased dramatically to 17%, up from a breakeven level last quarter. This significant sequential improvement in operating margins was driven by improved pricing, stronger data center SSD mix and overall record SSD revenue. And finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $675 million, down 3% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year, primarily from a reduction in automotive demand. The consolidated gross margins for FQ3 was 33.2%. Sequential gross margin improvement was driven by pricing improvements in both DRAM and NAND as well as our ongoing improvements in product mix that continue to underpin our financial performance. The impact of underutilization at our Lehi fab was approximately $155 million or 285 basis points in FQ3. We expect underutilization to be approximately $135 million in FQ4 and expect gradual declines in underutilization through fiscal 2021. Operating expenses were $823 million in FQ3. As we said on last quarter's call, we've taken several actions to control our operating expenses, given the increased uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. As a result, we continue to expect favorable underlying OpEx trends to continue into fiscal Q4. FQ3 operating income was $981 million, resulting in an operating margin of 18% compared to 11% in the prior quarter and 23% in the prior year. Net interest expense increased to $24 million compared to $6 million of net interest expense in the prior quarter. This increased expense was primarily driven by the drawdown of our revolver and subsequent $1.25 billion investment-grade note issuance in the quarter. We expect net interest expense will be approximately $30 million in FQ4 due to the decline in interest income because of lower interest rates. Our FQ3 effective tax rate was 3%, which benefited from approximately $19 million of onetime items. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 6%. Going forward into fiscal 2021, we expect our tax rate to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ3 were $0.82, up from $0.45 in FQ2 and down from $1.05 in the year ago quarter. FQ3 non-GAAP EPS was approximately $0.02 higher due to the tax benefits reported in the quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $2 billion in cash from operations in FQ3, representing 37% of revenue. During the quarter, net capital spending was approximately $1.9 billion, approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. As we enter the final quarter of FY '20, we are projecting fiscal year 2020 CapEx to be approximately $8 billion. Our FY '20 front end equipment CapEx will still be down more than 40% from last year. However, back-end CapEx and building CapEx, either of which add to bit supply growth, are up from last year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $101 million compared to $63 million in the prior quarter. This represents the 14th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, reflecting the structurally improved profitability and working capital improvements of the new Micron. We repurchased approximately 929,000 shares for $40 million in FQ3 at an average price of $43.54. In the 9 months of FY '20, we've returned $134 million of capital through repurchases and paid $266 million to settle conversion of convertible notes. Combining the convert premiums and share repurchases, we have used $338 million or 135% of FY '20 free cash flow towards reducing the share count. Ending FQ3 inventory was $5.4 billion or 131 days versus 134 days last quarter. Our overall days of inventory are above our approximately 110-day target level, partly due to elevated NAND inventory as we transition to replacement gate. We are also carrying higher raw material levels as a precaution, given the increased supply chain uncertainty due to the pandemic. We ended the quarter with total cash of $9.3 billion and total debt of $6.7 billion. Total liquidity was approximately $11.8 billion, up from $10.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of investment-grade notes. And those proceeds, together with $1.25 billion of cash on hand, was used to repay the $2.5 billion revolving credit facility we drew at the beginning of the fiscal third quarter. Prior to providing our outlook and guidance, we'd like to remind everyone that our fiscal Q4 is a 14-week quarter. Now turning to our outlook. As Sanjay mentioned, while visibility remains limited overall, data center trends are strong, and new gaming consoles will be a tailwind to demand in the second half of the calendar year. While end unit sales of consumer devices such as smartphones have started to recover, we are seeing an impact from the recent restrictions imposed on Huawei. It is also important to remember that we are a lagging indicator relative to the end demand. In addition, the risk of a second wave of COVID-19 infections is continuing to drive greater uncertainty for the economic recovery and our business. Lastly, inventory strategies of our customers are difficult to predict. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and respond to changes in the market environment in a timely and disciplined manner. With all of these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for FQ4 is as follows: We expect revenue to be $6 billion, plus or minus $250 million; gross margin to be in the range of 35.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $850 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.05, plus or minus $0.10. In closing, we're extremely proud of Micron's performance in this unprecedented period of market uncertainty and operational challenges. The tenacity, creativity and dedication of our team members around the world drove strong results that surpassed our initial expectations. Micron remains on very solid footing with an investment-grade balance sheet, ever strengthening product portfolio and secular industry trends that will continue to drive long-term demand. I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks. Thank you, Dave. The pandemic has impacted our financial performance trajectory, which was shaping up for a robust outcome this calendar year. Nevertheless, we have moved with agility to leverage the new opportunities in the marketplace and have further strengthened our product portfolio. Micron's portfolio is now dramatically better positioned from a competitive perspective, and we have driven a tremendous transformation here over the last 3 years. In the coming quarters and years, we will continue to strengthen our business foundation. And as the industry environment improves, Micron is exceptionally well positioned to take advantage of long-term trends and drive superior returns for our shareholders. Of course, preparing Micron for a bright future has to be about more than just quarterly business performance. We also have to be leaders in creating positive outcome for all of our stakeholders. In that context, there are 2 topics that I would like to touch upon before we move to Q&A. First, earlier this month, we issued our fifth annual sustainability report. This year, we set challenging new goals for energy use, emissions, water use and waste generation that aim to dramatically improve the environmental sustainability of our operations worldwide over the years ahead. We also established an aspirational future vision that will drive us to achieve even more. Reaching our goals will require investment, and we plan to devote approximately 2% of annual capital expenditures to environmental sustainability initiatives amounting to about $1 billion over the next 5 to 7 years. These initiatives underpin our commitment to achieve significantly higher standards and help create a better planet. Second, I would like to address the social unrest and racial division that have gripped our country. The senseless and tragic deaths of people in our black community in the U.S. must be addressed with real and lasting reforms. Hate, racial discrimination, violence and social injustice have no place in our society. Micron is committed to creating a welcoming and safe work environment for everyone, and we are taking concrete actions to increase technical training, career preparedness and opportunities for underserved population. We are also actively engaging and investing in community programs that aim to create a more just and fair society for everyone. There is much work to do and we look forward to being part of the solution. We will now open for questions.","So specifically with respect to data center, pre-COVID, we expected 2020 to be a year of strong growth in cloud, again, with all the trends building around AI and that needing more memory and storage. We expected healthy demand for pre-COVID in cloud applications. And of course, with COVID, as we discussed in the last earnings call, certainly, some of the trends got pulled in. Work-from-home economy as well as e-commerce, gaming, video streaming, all of these drove strong surge in demand on the cloud front. As we look ahead at the second half, of course, given the total COVID environment and uncertainties around COVID around the globe, we basically have limited visibility. Yet, we do believe that cloud demand in the second half of the calendar year will continue to be healthy for us. We work closely with our customers in terms of understanding their inventories. We understand what their demand trends are. And from what we can see, customer inventories with respect to cloud are in a healthy place. And of course, there are other parts of the market such as mobile phone, where there are other considerations such as geopolitical considerations as well as related to COVID as well, where customers may have built up some additional inventory. And in mobile, in particular, you saw in China that how in April, post-COVID within China, the demand went up, surged up for smartphones. So some of the customers may be preparing for -- as the consumer comes back, given the low point that the world experienced in March, April time frame, customers want to be prepared to supply the smartphone demand to them as well. So overall, it's a mixed picture with respect to the inventory on the customer front, cloud inventories are in decent shape. Mobile, I would say, is somewhat in anticipation of demand as well as managing to the supply chain consolidations due to COVID and some geopolitical considerations as well. So overall, I would say, when we look at fiscal first quarter, the environment is similar to what we had experienced in FQ3, FQ4. And of course, our best assessment is baked into the guidance that we have provided to you. So well, let me step back to Q3 just for a second. So gross margins obviously expanded in the third quarter as well. As I said in the prepared remarks, I'd say that, that was the pricing environment in both DRAM and NAND combined with just a richer mix of higher-value products, which obviously carry with it better gross margins. From a high-value solution perspective, I think we see that again in the fourth quarter that is helping drive an improved outlook for gross margins for the fourth fiscal quarter. You know, C.J., that we don't telegraph pricing and cost out for future quarters. But suffice it to say, we take both pricing and cost reductions into account. And obviously, the combination of those are pretty favorable. The other thing I would say is in the third fiscal quarter, we did have some expenses associated with COVID-19, both in terms of just increased spending on our part to manage through some disruptions that we had early on. And then on top of that, we did have to move around the back end production. That did increase our tariff expense in the third quarter. So those things, we wouldn't expect to happen again in the fourth quarter, which is helping also on the gross margin front in the fourth quarter. Yes. I mean the one thing to keep in mind is, so CapEx spending this year had a fair amount of construction expense. And actually, we drove the front end equipment expense down quite considerably on a year-over-year basis. Sanjay said in the prepared remarks that it was down more than 40% in both DRAM and NAND. So we cut back pretty heavily on the front end equipment side this year. Next year, we would expect some of that to come back, in particular, we're going through a full rotation into our second-generation replacement gate that certainly will drive some CapEx increases. And offsetting that, we'll have to look at construction and see what directionally we want to do there. I'd say we haven't firmed up the CapEx plans quite honestly for the year. As you know, we've maintained a lot of flexibility around CapEx. We take a hard look at the demand profile of bits over the next few years, and we kind of manage the front end CapEx accordingly to make sure that we're staying aligned with that. So over the next couple of months, we'll continue to refine our outlook over the next year or 2. And I think we'll be able to give you a better picture when we have our fourth quarter earnings announcement. I would say, when we looked at, coming in pre-COVID levels, on the CapEx front, for front-end equipment, and now that we look at it now, it certainly has been cut back. And our expectation is that will impact kind of our bit supply in the calendar fourth quarter. So we, of course, manage our mix on an ongoing basis. We assess customer demand expectations and make judgments regarding managing that mix. So yes, like you noted, we had shifted some of the supply from mobile toward the server applications. And at this point, we continue to make -- study how trends are evolving. And we think we are in a good position with respect to managing our mix. But if some changes are needed, we'll, of course, revert to making those changes in the future. So thanks for asking that question. Just to be clear, the foundry replacement on entity list, we had applied for licenses, and we secured those licenses for mobile and server shipments. And we do not supply into the networking side of the business. We never sought that license. So the entity list placement that had happened several months ago did impact some of our outlook, but we have been operating under the licenses that we have already received. The comment that I was making today is really related to last month's action by commerce department, which will go into effect sometime next month. And as a result of that action, we are already starting to see an impact in our fiscal Q4 as our customer reacts to the actions by the U.S. And quite frankly, impacts related to Huawei are still unfolding. We expect some of the impact to Huawei, yes, related to the foundries, but it affects their potentially overall considerations on managing their business, managing their supply chain. And we expect some of these impact to continue in FQ1 and beyond as well. And then this is compounded further by changing inventory strategies at customers as well as market share shifts that happened between the smartphone players. So as far as we are concerned, you know that we have improved our revenue diversity. We have significantly expanded and strengthened our product portfolio. And we have good design and activity with all key players, particularly with new products that we have introduced, such as UFS3.1, LP5, DRAM and multichip packages. So we continue to work with our customer ecosystem to mitigate the effects of this. But the particular comments that you heard us talk about on the Huawei front really relate to the actions from U.S. government that have -- last month that have impacted the customer reaction, the Huawei reaction to those actions and impacting our outlook in FQ4. In the May quarter, the FQ3 quarter, that did not -- the action announced last month did not -- action announced by the commerce department last month did not have an effect in FQ3. Now suffice it to say that we didn't list them as an over 10% customer, so you can make the assumption that it was below 10%. So what I can tell you is that Micron itself in our supply chain operations has focused on making sure, given all the considerations around the globe with all the uncertainties around COVID and COVID containment and COVID spread, Micron itself and its supply chain operations is increasing the inventory for raw materials to make sure that we are well prepared to meet our customer demand. So this trend of higher level of inventory, elevated level of inventory is -- it's been talked about, and it's common in the tech supply chain. And with respect to our specific customers for memory and storage, so as I mentioned earlier, so yes, some customers may have built some inventory given their considerations, their concerns around supply -- potential supply chain disruptions that may occur due to all the COVID-related uncertainties. As well as I pointed out, some of the customers in the mobile may have built some inventory, given U.S.-China trade tensions and the regulations. So the thing is, these are unprecedented times, uncertain times, not just for us or for the memory industry, but for our customer ecosystem as well. And customers' inventory strategies are changing. They are adapting as they themselves see how their market trends are evolving and how they want to best address their own inventory position as well. So this is the changing environment. We continue to work closely with our customers, and we make adjustments as appropriate. And key is to be adaptable and to be agile. And I think we have shown over the course of the first half of this calendar year that we have been really running our operations with tremendous amount of adaptability and agility and continuing to produce healthy results. We're not going to break it down here between China and rest of the world. But overall, when we look at in totality, we continue to see healthy demand trend in cloud in the second half of the year. And of course, cloud, when you look at long-term trends, I mean, long term, cloud is still actually in early innings, and long-term trends for cloud are strong because AI as well as 5G, 5G driving more intelligent devices at the edge, growing more data opportunities, it's really the virtuous cycle between cloud and intelligent devices at the edge. And then industrial IoT and everything around autonomous and robotics, all of these trends point to growth at the edge as well as in the cloud. So long-term trends continue to be healthy. Will it ever be a little bit lumpy here or there? Certainly, it can be. But the point is that long-term growth drivers are solid and secular in nature for cloud. So regarding the equipment piece that you asked, let me be very clear that Micron did receive its equipment in time because our equipment deliveries were rather early in fiscal Q3 toward our 1z technology ramp in DRAM and, of course, other aspects on the NAND front as well. So we did not say that equipment deliveries were delayed for us during FQ3. However, it is well-known and has been talked about in the industry that given the various challenges due to COVID, such as logistics and transportation-related challenges as well as supply chain challenges, some of the equipment deliveries have been impacted in the industry. And yes, for us, in the future, it is possible, given the challenges of COVID, that some of our deliveries in the future may get impacted. But in the past, we have been in good shape overall with respect to our receipt of equipment, again, because timing of most of that equipment delivery was such that we were able to actually escape some of the potential challenges in this regard. So from an industry point of view, if equipment deliveries get impacted, which have been talked about, there have been reports, equipment suppliers have talked about some of that as well, then obviously, that impacts technology transition capabilities, and therefore, it can impact supply, perhaps some with supply growth somewhat lower than pre COVID expectations due to the difficulty in making sure that the equipment are delivered on time as well as equipment install and equipment ramp is happening smoothly, given all the travel considerations involved as well. So yes, to the extent that affects the supply growth and lessens the supply growth, it obviously impacts the industry supply and demand environment. We have talked about that the demand also due to COVID in certain pockets certainly has been less, particularly those pockets related to COVID. So -- and we don't really comment on the pricing, but obviously, supply has an important role to play on the pricing front. Your second piece of the question regarding possible U.S. incentives for semiconductor manufacturing, let me first say that we are pleased that the U.S. administration as well as the Congress is considering incentives for U.S. semiconductor industry. This just goes to highlight that U.S. semiconductor industry is extremely important to our economy today. Semiconductor really forms the foundation of the economy of the future and also highlights the recognition of this importance by the officials in Washington, D.C. And really, it's important that U.S. maintains its global competitiveness and innovation capabilities. So from that point of view, we are pleased that there are these consolidations, the bill that is -- that has been put together. Of course, a lot of details still has to be worked out and the bills have to be approved. So we will continue to monitor this. And from the point of view of memory, I think important thing is that cost and scale in memory are extremely important considerations. Micron, in this regard, actually has a well-diversified footprint of front-end manufacturing across the globe. You know that we have fabs here in the U.S. in Manassas, Virginia, as well as in Utah, and state-of-the-art, best-in-class R&D facility in Boise, Idaho as well. And of course, we have R&D and manufacturing for memory in Asia as well. So we will continue to monitor these trends, but important considerations, our scale, cost and ROI on any investments is important. It's not just about government incentives. It's about managing the business in a healthy fashion, keeping in mind ROI considerations. And above all, it's extremely important that supply growth is managed in a cost-effective fashion but also managed in a fashion to not disrupt the industry, to certainly not disrupt Micron's supply plans and make sure that supply factor is aligned with demand CAGR. So while we welcome these incentives for growth of U.S. semiconductor industry and innovation agenda, we will continue to monitor this in a very disciplined fashion before we make any decisions in this regard. So linearity bookings was pretty -- I would call it pretty linear through the quarter. No surprises. And the mix -- of course, as we said, data centers showed good strength through the quarter, and mobile was a bit weaker than perhaps we were thinking coming into it, but just in terms of linearity. But in general, I would say, actually a fairly linear quarter for us. So Mehdi, you were breaking up a little bit. However, your question is a good question. And of course, we -- as you know, our customer base is extremely well diversified from automotive to data center to PC to smartphones and networking and industrial and consumer customers. So customer requirements with respect to discussions around supply and from us, they vary. Some of the customers are managing it on monthly basis, some manage it on quarterly basis. And with some customers, we do have supply agreements that extend for years time frame. Of course, certain pricing discussions, et cetera, I mean, are not part of these contracts. They tend to be around supply, and discussions around pricing tend to be on an ongoing basis. Auto is an example where the contracts can be multiyear contracts, long-term contracts, so it really varies from market to market. And you know that the technology and product mix continues to change as well. So I think we want to be careful in terms of the length of the contracts that we manage with the customers. And we manage, I believe, the diversity of our customers very well. And our customers value our supply. They are valuing the product portfolio that Micron is delivering. They are recognizing that we are the only company in the world that have NAND, DRAM and 3D XPoint and the ability to bring innovative products and solutions to them with a mix of technologies in them as well. And this really positions us uniquely. So our discussions really regarding longer-term nature of product road maps and supply considerations, we win all of these various aspects and are built around the road maps as well. So things do change in this business. And therefore, multiyear contracts are more in the market that are auto market where more legacy nodes are required to be in production for longer terms. But the parts of the markets where technology and products are moving fast, it's not about multiyear contracts there, but varying length of contracts depending upon the end market customers. Thank you for asking the question. We are very pleased with our execution in SSDs. As we noted, that record quarter for us in SSDs and really solid sequential growth in SSDs. And this is happening, as we had said before that during calendar year 2020, we will be expanding our portfolio of SSD solutions, introducing NVMe solutions for clients as well as data center markets. And we have said before that as we bring out those new solutions, as we qualify them with those customers, those NVMe solutions, it will give us an opportunity during the course of the year to gain share, and this is what has been happening during the course of this year. With our strong performance in SSDs, we actually have been gaining share, yet, our share is still relatively low. And as we continue to bring out new products in the future, and several are underway and several qualifications are underway as well with our customers, we will have ongoing opportunities through the course of next year as well in terms of driving for profitable share gains in the SSD market. And regarding QLC that you asked about, we are really pleased with our execution on the QLC front as well. We are shipping QLC SSDs in the consumer markets as well as we have product offerings that will be having -- drive future opportunity for us on the value side of the PC, on the OEM front as well. And QLC SSDs are also being used in read-intensive applications and replacing 10K HDDs as well. So you see there are multiple end market applications and opportunities for our SSDS. And we are already more than 10% of our total NAND consumption with respect to QLC, and this presents a good opportunity for us. And we fully expect our SSD mix to continue to increase as we bring out more new products over the course of next several quarters. So yes, I mean, QLC as a mix of SSD percentage will go up for us going forward. And let me just add that QLC is obviously an opportunity that instead of 3 bits per cell, it has 4 bits per cell. So obviously, once done right and you really have all the BOM costs taken care of on the product side, it gives you lower cost and, therefore, improved profitability opportunity as well. So we are certainly focused on increasing the mix of QLC. At the same time, TLC will remain vast majority of the market for a considerable period of time. So first of all, I would say on the inventory side, pre-COVID, data center customers as well as other customers largely had inventories that had returned to normal levels. And certainly, supplier inventories were at normal level as well pre-COVID. And the COVID environment, work-from-home environment has driven strong surge in demand on the data center front. And as we mentioned, we expect demand trends to continue to be healthy in the second half for data center as well. In terms of inventories in the data center market, yes, while certain customers may be carrying high levels of inventory, again, for the reasons that I had mentioned earlier, related to their own supply chain considerations as well as changing environment with respect to the demand. But the point is that compared to 2018 or 2019 environment, customer inventories are really at a much better, much healthier levels. This is not like a 2018, 2019 and situation, even if certain customers are carrying some higher levels of inventory, again, given the uncertainties around COVID. And the other point I would say is that while COVID does give us lower visibility and does bring about uncertainty, not just for us but for our customers as well, cloud is an area where the long-term demand trends, as I mentioned earlier, are secular in nature overall. So memory and storage, given the kind of application that customers -- our data center customers, hyperscalers are working on, those are requiring more memory and more storage. So the longer-term trend continues to be healthy. In the near term, yes, I mean, COVID does have unprecedented amount of challenges and uncertainty in the entire tech ecosystem, and we are doing our best to continue to work with our customers. Our relationships today, since you were asking about those, are certainly a lot closer than they were in the previous time frame. I would say that even hyperscale customers have become somewhat more sophisticated in terms of understanding the memory dynamics and improving their own supply chain operations. So it's really a 2-way relationship. We do work closely together with them. Having said all of that, of course, our visibility cannot be perfect in this area. We continue to focus on working closely with the customers, understanding the requirements and planning our supply chain accordingly. And what also helps is that the markets are quite diverse for us. I mean, yes, cloud is a strong driver of growth for the business, but also we are well diversified with strong mobile footprint as well as PC and between DRAM and NAND. And as we talked about, diversified into the gaming side with new gaming consoles coming in, needing more DRAM, twice as much DRAM, the new gaming consoles. So diversity of the business is certainly a helpful factor for us to manage through some of these uncertainties.","Sanjay, David, congratulations on the solid results. Sanjay, if you think back 90 days ago when you gave guidance for the May quarter, there was a lot of uncertainty around the pandemic, and you guys guided accordingly, in hindsight, extremely conservatively. I think your comment on the call last time was that you're building inventory, so you're assuming that your customers are building inventory. I guess as you look to the August quarter guide, was there a similar methodology used to inform this guide? And I guess, specifically, there's a lot of consternation in the investment community about data center demand, and you seem to be arguing that in your fiscal fourth quarter, it remains strong and you expect it to remain strong in the calendar second half. I'm wondering if you could just share with us why you think that and why you're not as concerned as some perhaps in the investment community about inventory builds? I guess a question on gross margins. How should we think about mix, particularly DRAM, as we move into the August quarter? And I guess, would love to hear, as part of that, what implied cost downs will look like? And really just trying to understand the nice step up you're seeing, how much of that is mix versus cost down versus perhaps other? I'd like to add my congrats. Just on CapEx, seems like this year, there were some concern it that may be lower at $8 billion. I guess when you look at next year, I don't know where your starting point was. But I was wondering if you could walk us through some of your moving pieces. You talked about 5G as being the big tailwind. That makes sense. I'm curious what you would highlight that you're taking in account for next year on the other way. And congratulations on the solid execution. Last earnings call, the team highlighted the supply production shift in mix from mobile to server DRAM to service the higher demand from your data center customers. Given the outlook for stronger data center demand, are you guys keeping the production mix more heavily weighted towards server DRAM? Or are you already starting to shift part of your DRAM production mix back to mobile? Sanjay, you talked about Huawei, I think, twice or maybe 3 times. And I know you've been reshipping under the licenses, and the new restrictions are really on ASICs, not on standard products. So is that comment really more around the fact that this is sort of the last extension of the commerce licenses, and so you won't be able to ship to them in another few months? And can you sort of quantify how much is your Huawei exposure right now? And then I guess, just how much of revenue was it maybe in May, Dave? I wanted to ask about customer inventory. I want to revisit that. To the extent that customers are wrestling with pretty unprecedented potential supply challenges, do you think they're building up buffer inventory to deal with that? I mean, we've seen single earthquakes in one region caused that behavior in the past. Now we're dealing with rolling outages across multiple continents. Do you think customers may be building inventory? And if so, do you think memory is sort of less or more impacted than other things from that? And I have a follow-up. Great. And then in terms of the strength that you guys are seeing in cloud in the second half, would you differentiate it all by geography? I think you mentioned China being stronger, but is it any different in China versus the rest of the world in cloud? So you guys mentioned 2 things on the call that I wanted to double-click on. So the first one is you mentioned that some of the shipments that's semi-capped didn't come in on time. So is this enough, in your opinion, to kind of impact the price of memory? I'm not looking for specific numbers, but was the shipment miss impactful enough that you think it's going to hurt supply enough to move the price? And then secondly, just high level, any comments on the U.S. government kind of incentivizing U.S. manufacturing? So we got TSMC coming to United States. And any impact you guys think it will have on you guys in the future? Just a question. Can you just talk about the linearity of bookings during the quarter? Did they sort of build all quarter? Was there some volatility in there? And then you also mentioned that mobile and data center were the strongest end markets. Were both of those stronger than expected? Most of the good questions have been asked. I just have a follow-up. I'm just wondering, Sanjay, what would it take for your customers to feel comfortable in signing multiyear -- by quarter, rather, contracts? I remember when supply was tied back in 2016 and '17, the industry was highlighting the longer-term contracts associated with enterprise customer. I think that has changed. And in that context, how do you see (inaudible) coming back and be a more (inaudible) part of the memory industry? It's great to see the improvements in your SSD segment, both client and enterprise. First, what sort of percentage could QLC drives represent as a portion of your overall SSD mix next year? Could it be 25% or more? And I'd appreciate hearing your perspective on the development taking place in enterprise SSDs. On one hand, your U.S.-based competitor has been adamant they're going to gain significant share in enterprise SSDs this year. Yet merchant controller manufacturers do enable cloud providers to design their own in-house enterprise SSDs rather than just relying on off-the-shelf SSDs from OEMs. So I was hoping you could just provide the opportunity that you see in enterprise SSD this year versus peers. And how you see that playing out in the next 12 to 24 months, particularly as some of the new technologies that you're introducing and providing, such as PCIe 4.0 becomes more mainstream. Congrats on strong numbers today. Just as a follow-up question on the data center segment. There seems to be -- I mean it sounds like everything you said stays very upbeat, quite bullish on data center demand remaining quite strong. There seems to be some worries in the market, particularly around some investors of hyperscalers inventory have been increase slightly. And I think the worry is stemming from what happened in '18 with the cuts in orders in late 2018, which continued too much of 2019. So my question is how has the communication changed with the data center at the hyperscalers? Are you having more frequent and closer communication with them to determine -- trying to get a better idea of what the inventory levels are? Or otherwise, how can you help kind of soothe those fears that data center demand is going to remain stronger for longer, as we hope it will?

Good afternoon. I hope all of you and your families are safe. These are unprecedented times, and I'm calling from home today. In Micron's fiscal second quarter, we delivered strong results, including revenue at the high end of our guided range even as the COVID-19 crisis began to unfold halfway through our quarter. We have now achieved positive free cash flow for 13 consecutive quarters. This performance represents a marked improvement from historical cycles and is evidence of the strength of the new Micron. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created both operational challenges and macroeconomic concerns. Micron has more than 37,000 team members in 18 countries around the world. Since the earliest signs of the outbreak in China, we have taken proactive measures to safeguard our employees. Where possible, Micron employees are working from home, and we have suspended all local and international business travel globally. We implemented health screenings at all Micron locations. We were among the first in the industry to implement physical separation protocols at all our manufacturing sites globally to mitigate the risk of community spread with blue teams and red teams that operate on alternate schedules. We have been requiring self-declaration and self-quarantine measures as this crisis has spread, whereby team members, contractors and their immediate families observe 14 days of work from home after any air or sea travel. As of yesterday, we have 2 employees who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus and are receiving appropriate medical attention. At the 2 sites where we have confirmed cases, we have used contact tracing to quarantine individuals who were in close contact with either infected team member. We have also implemented more restrictive controls of on-site access, social distancing and service protocols. As a result of stringent preventative measures in place, these events have not impacted our manufacturing operations thus far. We have also taken measures to protect our raw material supply and increase our supply chain flexibility. First, we have been in close ongoing communication with our suppliers to ensure continuity and identify supply gaps. Second, we have increased our on-hand inventory of raw materials and have begun to store more of that supply on our sites to minimize the impact of any logistics delays. Third, we have increased our focus on multi-sourcing of parts to reduce supplier dependence risk. And fourth, we have added assembly and test capacity at both our captive and contract manufacturing sites to provide redundant manufacturing capability in multiple regions. As COVID-19 spreads, we are complying with all government orders at our global sites. These orders may result in a temporary or prolonged shutdown of our sites, which could impact our shipments this quarter. For example, on March 16, the Malaysian government issued a restriction of movement order resulting in the closure of borders and most businesses in Malaysia. Subsequently, the Malaysian government added semiconductors to the list of essential services, and we were able to resume operations. Our assembly and test facilities in Muar and Penang, primarily used for packaging high-value NAND, were briefly shut down and have since been able to return to production on a very limited basis in compliance with local regulations. We are using our global supply chain network and increased flexibility to try and mitigate this production impact, and we are working to keep our commitments to our customers. Turning now to COVID-19's effect on demand. COVID-19 is significantly impacting China's economic growth in the calendar first quarter, reflected in the sharp decline of smartphone and automobile unit sales. Weaker sell-through of consumer electronics and our customers' factory shutdowns in China were headwinds for us late in our fiscal second quarter. In China, lower consumer demand was offset by stronger data center demand due to increased gaming, e-commerce and remote work activity. Looking to the third quarter, as these trends also take shape worldwide, data center demand in all regions look strong and is leading to supply shortages. In addition, we are seeing a recent increase in demand for notebooks used in the commercial and educational segments to support work from home and virtual learning initiatives occurring in many parts of the world. We are also encouraged to see manufacturers in China increasingly returning to full production, and we have recently started to see China smartphone manufacturing volumes recover. Nevertheless, as the world deals with the outbreak of COVID-19, we expect that overall demand for smartphones, consumer electronics and automobiles will be below our prior expectations for the second half of our fiscal 2020. Once the U.S. and other major economies have demonstrated containment of the virus's spread, we expect a rebound in economic activity. Much depends on potential government stimulus and the rate, pace and effectiveness of containment efforts. We are modeling an improvement in the trajectory of economic activity later into the second half of calendar 2020 with a further rebound in economic momentum into 2021. This is a very fluid situation, and we will learn more about the virus, its spread and its economic impact over the next few weeks and months. Anticipating changes to our customer demand, we have been moving supply from smartphone to service the strength in data center markets for both DRAM modules as well as SSDs. Just like we have increased our raw materials inventory in these uncertain times, it is possible that certain customers are similarly increasing their inventory of DRAM and NAND products. We will manage our business with prudent and proactive action and continue to work closely with customers to understand their latest demand outlook. We are evaluating our production levels and CapEx plans for calendar 2020 and will adjust to the most recent demand requirements. Once we emerge from this low-visibility environment that is impacted by COVID-19, we expect the industry to resume its long-term growth trajectory with a DRAM demand growth CAGR in the mid- to high teens and NAND in the 30% range. For both DRAM and NAND, we expect our multiyear supply growth CAGR to be in line with the industry's demand growth CAGR. Focusing on 2020, we returned our DRAM operations to full utilization at the beginning of the calendar year, and our NAND operations continue to run with reduced wafer starts as we deploy capital efficiently through our conversion to replacement gate. While we returned our DRAM utilization to full production, we remain flexible to adjusting these levels depending on the near-term demand environment. Node transitions and industry supply growth in calendar 2020 could be impacted by disruptions to equipment companies' operations including travel restrictions, hindering, field service and engineering support. Recently, some equipment companies have also indicated delays in equipment deliveries due to the impact of various government actions to combat COVID-19. The situation with coronavirus is rapidly evolving, and disruptions could be much larger than we can see today. However, our continued focus on innovation and execution, combined with our rock-solid balance sheet, puts us in an excellent position to navigate this period of uncertainty and capitalize on the long-term opportunities driving our industry once conditions eventually normalize. Stepping away from the COVID-19 discussion, I want to spend a few minutes talking about the tremendous progress we have made on our technology and products. This progress is contributing to the underlying strength of the new Micron, and this is a source of excitement for us as we look to the future. The new Micron is undergoing a dramatic transformation to combine product leadership with technology, manufacturing and supply chain excellence. Our objective is to have leading process technology so that we can deliver differentiated products to our customers and maintain a competitive cost structure. We are making good progress on this front in both DRAM and NAND. In DRAM, we were the first to introduce 1Z in volume production and expect over half of our bit production to be on 1Y and 1Z by the summer of 2020. We are managing the construction schedule of our new Taiwan cleanroom expansion carefully and currently remain on target for first output in calendar 2021. In the fiscal second quarter, we began sampling 1Z-based DDR5 modules and are on track to introduce high-bandwidth memory in calendar 2020. We are also making good progress in our 1-alpha node. In NAND, we made significant progress on our replacement gate, or RG, transition and expect to begin volume production in our current quarter with revenue shipments to follow in our fiscal fourth quarter. We expect replacement gate production to be a meaningful portion of our total NAND supply by the end of this calendar year. Micron continues to lead on QLC NAND, which lowers cost for SSDs and helps us target market segments that are currently served by HDDs. QLC SSD bit shipments rose by 60% sequentially in our fiscal second quarter with a meaningful portion of our consumer SSDs now shipping with our QLC technology. We expect QLC to continue growing in the second half of the fiscal year as market adoption increases. In the fiscal second quarter, we made significant progress on increasing the mix of high-value NAND bits to over 70% of total NAND bits, and we remain on track to drive this figure to around 80% in fiscal 2021. Despite normal seasonal weakness in COVID-19, mobile MCP products had record revenue in the quarter and showed strong sequential growth. SSD revenue also grew approximately 20% sequentially, led by greater than 50% growth in data center SSDs. The resolution of the assembly and test constraints we experienced in the fiscal first quarter, combined with market share gains, drove strong growth in these product lines. This mix improvement increases our profitability and reduces the volatility in our margins. Now let's turn to 3D XPoint. As the only company in the world with a portfolio of DRAM, NAND and 3D XPoint technologies, Micron is uniquely positioned in the marketplace. We are encouraged by the customer reception of our first 3D XPoint product, the X100, which is the fastest storage device in the world. It is a great start to our portfolio of differentiated 3D XPoint products built in collaboration with our customers. As we mature this X100 solution, we look forward to engaging a broader set of customers this year and delivering the value of 3D XPoint to the data center market. Early in March, we entered into a new 3D XPoint wafer sale agreement with Intel that replaces previous agreements. Intel has been an important partner over the years, and this new agreement ensures a continuation of our close relationship. Now turning to highlights by products and markets. In SSDs, we had record consumer SSD revenue, assisted by growth of our QLC NVMe consumer SSDs. We expect strong sequential bit growth in our NVMe product portfolio in fiscal third quarter as we continue the transition from SATA to NVMe. In SATA, we achieved several customer qualifications for our newest 96-layer SATA-based data center SSD. In the fiscal second quarter, we became the first company to deliver LP5 mobile DRAM products to customers, including Xiaomi, which is using our LP5 in its 5G-capable Mi 10 smartphones in 8- and 12-gigabyte configurations. More recently, we have begun sampling the world's first LP5 DRAM-based UFS MCPs. These LP5 DRAM products will enable longer smartphone battery life and high-performance image processing. They are great examples of how Micron is innovating for our customers to enhance the end user experience. We are encouraged that LP5 and UFS will become even more important as 5G adoption accelerates, reigniting smartphone unit sales and driving content growth. In just 2 short years, we have gone from trailing the competition in our mobile product portfolio to leading the industry with innovative first-of-a-kind products, consistent with our new Micron strategy. In the data center market, we benefited from strong demand for our products from key cloud and enterprise customers, driven in part by ongoing strength in cloud markets, increased use of online properties, such as e-commerce and the surge and remote work requirements due to COVID-19 containment measures. In the graphics market, GDDR6 bit shipments increased more than 40% quarter-over-quarter, and we anticipate strong growth with the launch of new gaming consoles that are expected to feature 16 gigabyte of GDDR6. These new consoles also deploy SSDs in place of hard drives for the first time. In the PC market, DRAM bit shipments and revenue declined sequentially, driven by a slow seasonal demand and continued CPU shortages. Our client SSD sales also declined sequentially. In the automotive market, we delivered record DRAM and NAND revenue despite soft global automobile unit sales as content growth remains strong in this market. Micron continues to lead the auto market with the industry's highest quality products. Power efficiency is increasingly important in the auto market, creating an opportunity for Micron to leverage our strength in low-power DRAM. LPDRAM now makes up approximately half of our auto DRAM revenue. In the industrial market, we had record bit shipments for both DRAM and NAND. In the longer term, we expect secular growth in the industrial IoT market as 5G rolls out and increases the importance of AI, machine learning and compute at the edge. I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance. Thanks, Sanjay. We executed well in the fiscal second quarter, and our reported financial results largely came in at the high end of our guidance ranges despite the uncertainty and impacts related to COVID-19. Prior to the event of COVID-19, we had outlined our expectations that F Q2 would mark the low point of our financial performance in this cycle, and our business trajectory has been consistent with those expectations. While we still expect improvements in our financial results, these expectations now need to reflect the evolving impacts of COVID-19. As Sanjay said, the situation remains fluid, and we continue to assess our plans and make real-time changes to adapt and optimize our operations. Total F Q2 revenue was approximately $4.8 billion, the high end of the guidance we provided for the quarter. Revenue was down 7% sequentially and down 18% year-over-year. F Q2 DRAM revenue was $3.1 billion, representing 64% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 11% sequentially and 26% year-on-year. Bit shipments were down by approximately 10% sequentially and up more than 20% on a year-on-year basis. ASPs were flat sequentially. F Q2 NAND revenue was approximately $1.5 billion or 32% of total revenue. Revenue increased 6% sequentially and was up 9% year-on-year. Bit shipments declined in the low single-digit percentage range sequentially and increased approximately 20% year-on-year. ASPs increased in the upper single-digit percentage range sequentially. Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the compute and networking business unit was approximately $2 billion, down approximately 1% sequentially and down 17% year-over-year. We have now started to include all 3D XPoint revenue in CNBU reporting as the use cases for 3D XPoint technology are more closely aligned with memory expansion, and this business is being managed by CNBU. Excluding 3D XPoint, CNBU revenue would have been down 7% sequentially, primarily driven by weaker sales in the PC market. Revenue for the mobile business unit was $1.3 billion, down 14% sequentially and down 22% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonality in certain products as well as our decision to walk away from some business due to our concerns regarding pricing. Revenue for the storage business unit in F Q2 was $870 million, down 10% from F Q1 and down 15% year-over-year. Without 3D XPoint, SBU revenue was up 9% sequentially. Operating profit margins for SBU improved sharply in the quarter and were at approximately breakeven levels. And finally, revenue for the embedded business unit was $696 million, down 5% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. The consolidated gross margin for F Q2 was 29.1%, exceeding the high end of the guidance range. The quarter-over-quarter margin improvement was driven by portfolio mix improvements and NAND pricing, and approximately $50 million of benefit came from the NAND depreciable life change we made in the prior quarter. The impact of underutilization at our Lehi Fab was approximately $142 million or 295 basis points in F Q2. We expect underutilization to be approximately $160 million in F Q3. We're continuing our efforts to reduce spending in our Lehi Fab, which we expect will begin to materialize in fiscal 2021. Operating expenses were $856 million in F Q2. Given the increased uncertainty, we have taken additional steps to control our OpEx. These actions include freezing our near-term hiring and cutting back significantly on discretionary spending. As a result, we expect OpEx to decline sequentially in F Q3. For modeling purposes, our F Q4 will be a 14-week quarter. As a result, we expect an uptick in operating expenses for F Q4 that is consistent with the extra week in the quarter. F Q2 operating income was $542 million, representing 11% of revenue. Operating margin was nearly flat compared to the prior quarter. Net interest expense was $6 million compared to $7 million of net interest income in the prior quarter. Since the Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates, we anticipate lower interest income on our cash balance for F Q3. With the increased debt from the drawdown of our revolver, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $35 million in F Q3, and it will likely be modestly higher in F Q4, with a full quarter impact of the lower interest income. Our F Q2 effective tax rate was 3.2%. For the remainder of FY '20, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 5%. We expect our long-term tax rate to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Non-GAAP earnings per share in F Q2 were $0.45, down modestly from $0.48 in F Q1 and $1.71 in the year-ago quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $2 billion in cash from operations in F Q2, representing 42% of revenue. During the quarter, net capital spending was approximately $1.9 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter. We're continuing to project FY '20 CapEx in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion, including some increases for assembly and test flexibility that Sanjay mentioned. Free cash flow in the quarter was $63 million compared to $86 million in the prior quarter. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Our ability to generate cash consistently through the cycle is largely the result of the structural improvements made to Micron's profitability, which has led to more than $1.5 billion of operating cash flow improvement and more than 25 percentage points of operating cash flow improvement compared to the trough quarter of the prior cycle. We repurchased approximately 785,000 shares for $44 million in F Q2. In the first half of fiscal 2020, we returned $94 million of capital through repurchases, representing approximately 65% of our free cash flow. Ending F Q2 inventory was $5.2 billion or 134 days. The increase was expected and largely due to the seasonally weaker demand experienced in F Q2 combined with our strategy of holding more NAND inventory as we approach our transition to replacement gate later in the calendar year. We have also increased our raw material levels as a precaution given increased uncertainty in the supply chain with these materials. As we had outlined on our prior earnings call, we continue to walk away from unfavorably priced business, which also added to our near-term inventory levels. We ended the quarter with total cash of $8.1 billion and total liquidity of approximately $10.6 billion. F Q2 ending total debt was $5.4 billion. To preserve ready access to our liquidity in a period of macroeconomic uncertainty, early this quarter, we drew $2.5 billion from our revolving credit facility. Now turning to our outlook. Based on our conversations with our customers, the demand for our products remains strong and the pricing trends are favorable. However, it is important to note that we are a lagging indicator relative to end demand, and macro projections have significantly weakened in the near term. It is also currently unclear, the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand. In addition, we also faced the continued risk of production and logistic disruptions due to government actions, labor and material shortages and to travel and border restrictions. Given these unusual uncertainties, our guidance ranges are wider than usual. However, these wider ranges do not reflect the magnitude of all the risks, and results could vary significantly from these ranges. Our guidance ranges also include expenses for COVID-19 mitigation efforts. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for F Q3 is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion; gross margin to be in the range of 31%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $825 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.55, plus or minus $0.15. In closing, notwithstanding the near-term uncertainty, we are pleased with Micron's financial execution exiting this cyclical downturn. F Q2 revenue was approximately 65% higher and gross margins 11 percentage points higher than in the prior trough, which occurred in F Q3 of 2016. This revenue growth far outpaced the growth of the overall semiconductor industry in this period. As we assess our cross-cycle performance from the last trough to this trough, we have delivered average returns as follows: gross margins of more than 40%, EBITDA margins of 50%, CapEx to revenue in the 30s and return on invested capital exceeding 20%. While the near-term business environment is uncertain, we believe that long-term demand trends for Micron remain robust. Our focus on execution, our strong product portfolio and our solid balance sheet ensure that Micron is in the best position to capitalize on the secular trends driving our business. I will now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks. Thank you, Dave. I want to close by thanking our extraordinary Micron team around the globe. These recent weeks have placed unforeseen challenges on businesses but, more importantly, on people and families. Micron's team has responded with professionalism and care during this period, and our team members are the reason we can execute our business plan and deliver the strong results we have reported today. To assist during this period, we are offering U.S. team members earning less than $100,000 per year a special onetime payment of $1,000. These figures are adjusted for market rates worldwide, and 68% of our global team is eligible. In addition, we are establishing an emergency relief fund for employees facing financial hardship. We are also focused on assisting the communities in which we operate through this difficult time. As part of that effort, we are contributing an additional $10 million through the Micron Foundation to address the impact of COVID-19 on top of what we have already donated in China, Italy and the U.S. We are also working with local officials to make space in our facilities available if needed for emergency services as well as providing support through our supply chain operations to help source needed screening and protective equipment. Finally, we are accelerating our payment terms to our small business vendors to help with their liquidity. I've said many times that the new Micron is stronger than ever, and we are showing that strength today. Micron is leveraging our core expertise to drive leadership in technology, products and manufacturing, delivering differentiated solutions that enrich life for end customers around the world. While the near-term environment creates uncertainty for all of us in our daily lives, the long-term fundamentals of our industry are strengthening, and opportunities are expanding. With these opportunities in front of us, we will continue to execute with tenacity and resilience as we make demonstrable progress towards our vision. We will now open for questions.","Well, we -- I mean clearly, as I said -- oh, sorry. Yes. Sure. So let me -- I'm sorry. I was just going to say, let me address that first, and then I will definitely have Dave expand on that. So it is an environment where there can be supply shortages. And of course, underlying demand trends in the markets we are participating continue to be strong. There can be supply shortages given the fluid situation related to the spread of coronavirus in various countries. The rate and pace is different. And ultimately, it will depend upon the rules and regulations that different governments may impose that can potentially impact supply in the industry. So just like we are accumulating some inventory ourselves to make sure that we don't have supply disruptions, it is legitimate to think that our customers can also be building some inventory to make sure that their supply chain is under control. So I think this is the part that we are just mindful of. Although when you look at work-from-home economy and study-from-home economy for students that are certainly driving greater demand in the enterprise PC side and certainly placing quite a bit of constraints and stress on the infrastructure, so the cloud infrastructure, the enterprise infrastructure definitely is driving increased demand as well. So in that backdrop, I think we are just being mindful in terms of making those comments. But I will let Dave further elaborate on it. Yes. I think what you covered, Sanjay, is good. The only thing I'd add is I think we believe the strength in the data center market is real and that the inventory levels are normal in that market. So certainly, as you noted, we are not guiding to Q4 here. And, of course, the environment is fluid. These are unprecedented times in terms of anybody dealing any business, any verticals or any country dealing with the situation and the spread and containment of coronavirus. But what I would say here is that with respect to our own assessment of the demand trends, I think underlying demand trends definitely continue to be healthy. And when we look at what we supply to our customers, customers build it into the product, if there has to be any macroeconomic weakness, and we know that in the environment of coronavirus pandemic, there will be some impact on some aspects of the consumer demand. The consumer demand, there's a lag between the consumer demand getting impacted to the demand from our customers who are building the product in their supply chains getting impacted. So that's what we mean that sometimes there can be a lag between what we are supplying to our customers versus the impact on the demand in the marketplace. So we are not guiding to fourth quarter. I think what's important is that it will depend on the spread of the virus, the containment of the virus. Different countries may have their containment at different rates. So while we have seen, for example, last fiscal quarter, our F Q2, demand in China, in the consumer demand and the smartphone demand decline, we have also seen that China has contained this. And, in fact, production is coming back in China, and the demand is being restored in China. Same thing will happen in other parts of the world as well, that while there may be some impact on smartphone demand in different countries, eventually, as the containment happen, the consumer demand will be back, and the long-term trends certainly for our business are strong. The trends of 5G driving greater content in smartphone when we come back on the other side of this pandemic, there will be -- the demand drivers will reassert themselves. Similarly, cloud demand continues to do well. As I mentioned, the COVID-19 scenario may actually be accelerating some of that demand in cloud that is driving greater demand for memory and storage. The point is, the situation is fluid, and we are really not prepared to guide you to F Q4 at this point. So I'll let Dave address that. Okay. Yes. Sure. So maybe without throwing out a number because it's difficult to estimate, clearly, we would have been above the high end of the range on revenue if not for COVID-19. And there were some mitigation expenses already in both cost of sales and operating expenses that impacted us a bit in the fiscal second quarter as well. We would have likely been more skewed to a higher growth number for fiscal third quarter if not for COVID-19. And, of course, somewhat unusual for us, we widened the range by a couple of hundred million dollars also to account for the uncertainty as it relates to what might happen, not only from a demand perspective, but from a supply perspective. Either one has some risk to it. Additionally, we have built in more costs associated with COVID mitigations for us. Sanjay and I already talked about the fact that we're carrying higher levels of inventory of raw materials, but we're also having to flex our supply chain back and have some redundancy that can drive up some expenses on the cost of sales side. In addition, we may see an increased level of tariff expense in an effort to mitigate some supply disruptions that might occur. And also, there's a fair amount of expense associated with just the work-from-home model and allow -- enabling our employees to be able to do all the work they do in the offices now in their homes, and so there are some expenses associated with that. So our expense likely would have been down even more, particularly with all the actions we've taken to reduce expenses, if not for the fact that we have a bit of this offset or headwind associated with the mitigation expenses in the third quarter. So I think what we have said before the COVID-19 scenario that in calendar year '20, the DRAM demand growth would be in mid-teens, around mid-teens, and that supply would be somewhat less for the year, supply growth would be somewhat less for the year than the demand growth. And of course, as we look at the scenario of supply growth, technology transitions, the node transitions in the industry perhaps can be impacted by tool deliveries or the engineering or the service support in the industry. It's too soon to tell this but the point is that there could be some impact to supply and not just related to the wafer output, but there could be some impact to the supply, as I said before, depending upon the rules and regulations and the orders in various countries where the supply chain for memory and storage exists. If those orders impact any production, there could be some supply growth impact there as well. It's hard to tell at this point. And we certainly, when we look at our current supply growth, our current supply growth at this point is intact, but we are mindful of the changes that could occur due to the COVID environment. And of course, we continue to watch the demand as well. And on the supply side, we will take actions. Today, we have shortages in supply, as we have mentioned, for server DRAM as well as for cloud. Overall, there are shortages for DRAM. And therefore, we are shifting some of the supplies from mobile to the DRAM side. But of course, we'll continue to keep track of what the demand looks like. And as we said, we will evaluate making reductions in our production utilization or in terms of any CapEx aspects to manage the supply growth during the calendar year '20, but it's too soon to really give you any specific projections on that. So I'll let Dave answer that. Yes. So I think cumulative revenues, I'll have to go back and look at the exact statistic, but it was somewhere in the kind of 30%, I think it was, China revenue in aggregate. Clearly, as you said, there is a come-back-to-work kind of phenomenon going on in China, and there is economic stimulus. So that certainly will benefit. But we're -- also the customers in the U.S. are -- a lot of them are in the cloud space. And of course, that's a big driver of our business today, given, as Sanjay mentioned, the move to work-from-home and e-commerce and so forth. So I'm not sure that the mix, as we projected, is likely to shift around significantly, geographically. In terms of CapEx, we -- for our fiscal third quarter, we won't be impacting the CapEx of fiscal third quarter. However, for the rest of the calendar year '20, we certainly will be, as I said before, evaluating our CapEx as well as our production utilization to make sure that our supply stays in line with our demand expectations. Demand expectations, of course, we laid out, working closely with our customers. So just like in 2019, we made changes to CapEx fairly rapidly, and we reacted fast as well as we manage our production. We will, of course, be doing the same things here. Just keep in mind that the situation with respect to coronavirus escalation across the globe just has really evolved rapidly over the course of last couple of weeks. So we will, of course, keep close tabs with our customer demand expectations. And we will make sure that we make any adjustments to our CapEx, if needed, accordingly. We are absolutely continuing to look at that. And in terms of cost reductions, of course, cost reductions are a function of technology transitions that are being made in the fabs. And so far, we are on plan with respect to the cost guidance that we had provided to you for our fiscal year '20. I would add that on the NAND front, as you've seen, we've gotten a fair amount of benefit from the change in depreciation in the first half of fiscal '20. So that, in essence, kind of pulled ahead. As you remember probably, we mentioned that as we transition to replacement gate, FY '20 would show a minimal cost decline. And really FY '21 was where we would see it. But with the depreciation change, in reality, what's happening is we're kind of pulling ahead some of that improvement into fiscal '20. So when you look at the percentages, a bit better in FY '20 and maybe not as good as we had originally kind of telegraphed in FY '21. And in addition, what -- we continue to drive this mix to the high-value solutions, they generally carry higher costs. And we hope to continue that. Our goal is to get to 80%. So that certainly will also be an impact on the cost side as well. But if you step back and then look at how we do over a multiyear period in terms of NAND improvement, once we're really running on the second-generation replacement gate, in good momentum, we're up to the right yields, it's running through the inventory and showing up in cost of sales, and you see that over a multiyear period, you'll see that our decline in costs over a multiyear period is actually very good, very healthy, very competitive. And I will just add that due to COVID-19, as we said, that we are enabling greater flexibility in our supply network by adding captive capacity as well as adding capacity on part of our subcontractors to give us the opportunity and resiliency in the supply chain in case there are rules and regulations in various countries that impact our production. So some of those aspects certainly do have headwind on the cost side. But by and large, I think those are being managed well. And overall, our cost targets for fiscal year '20 at this point are on track. I mean we certainly work closely with those customers. Our relationships over time have only deepened with those customers. We have become a more valuable partner to them as well as we have expanded our product offering. For example, on the SSD side, we have brought out NVMe SSDs, those are getting qualified in data center. On the DRAM side, we have been a strong partner with highest quality with those customers. And on the cloud side, still in the very, very early innings of all the growth for memory and storage in cloud. So compared to the last cycle, our relationships with those customers have only expanded, have deepened. We continue to work closely with them in terms of understanding their demand requirements. And this is what -- the best that we can do in terms of working closely with those customers to understand their requirement. And I would like to once again point out that we are in an environment even before COVID-19 that CapEx investments in cloud were on a strong growth trajectory. A lot of that CapEx going toward the infrastructure for memory and storage requirements. Of course, new CPU architectures with more cores in them as well as more channels giving you greater attach rates for memory and storage and, of course, the workloads that are demanding more DRAM memory for memory-intensive compute applications as well as for faster access driving more SSDs. So those demand trends pre-COVID were already strong. And with COVID, if anything, we are seeing that work-from-home digital economy is driving greater demand on that structure and is accelerating some of that demand. So we, of course, as we work through the memory shortages, we continue to work closely with our customers. And while the smartphone demand may be somewhat down, for example, in China in F Q2, but that demand is coming back in China. And we will continue to monitor these trends in the other parts, and it just requires continuing to work closely with the customers, understanding the requirements and us applying our own judgment and remaining mindful in terms of how we manage overall our supply. So it's really customer relationship in terms of managing our supply growth and understanding the demand expectations. Certainly, as we expand our portfolio of SSDs, yes, previously, we just had SATA. Now we have NVMe SSDs as well, and we are broadening our reach with those NVMe SSDs and to the end market applications as well as with customers. Certainly, it is a growth market opportunity for us, not only in DRAM but also in SSDs. But as you know, these take product qualifications with the customers. And then we are able to realize the benefit of sales and revenue growth in those areas. I want to highlight here that as we have expanded our product portfolio, both on the SSD side as well as in mobile, on multichip packages, and bringing out discrete UFS products for mobile applications as well, that really has enabled, as I mentioned in the script, opportunity for us to gain share in the marketplace. We have gained share in NAND, managed NAND solutions in mobile. We have gained share in SSDs as well that's enabling us to deliver healthy results in F Q2. And our gain in share and expanding product portfolio also positions us well to navigate through these choppy waters related to COVID-19, and we remain very focused on continuing to expand the product portfolio and broaden our customer relationships in the kind of applications that you just talked about in gaming consoles, both for DRAM and NAND as we look forward to the future long-term secular demand trends and addressing those requirements by our customers. So yes, that's correct. I think there is near-term surge in demand with respect to commercial PCs. I mean if you look at just Micron itself, Micron itself bought something like 5,000 notebook computers to really provide it to our team members in terms of enabling them to work from home, and we implemented those really very, very fast. So yes, surge in demand related to enterprise PCs, and that bodes well for both SSDs as well as for DRAM. And as we noted, also with respect to virtual learning and students learning from home, that also drives demand in notebook. How long this trend last -- and of course, it is global in nature. But how long does it last, we will have to see. But overall, yes, I mean, we do see that. While there may be some smartphone -- the weakness outside of China, while China is recovering on the smartphone front, certainly, as I said, enterprise PCs and other PCs for virtual learning, along with greater demand in the data center world, is a tailwind for us. So we don't break it down specifically in terms of percentage, but I think what's important is that we are a very well-diversified supplier, and we have a broad portfolio. And the end market applications are well diversified as well, all the way from data center to PC to smartphone, networking, for DRAM, and Micron is well positioned in these markets. And certainly, some of these markets are seeing some shortages today, such as on the side of data center DRAM requirements. And while others, we are continuing to monitor the overall demand trend. But we don't break it out, but important thing is that the underlying vectors for demand are good. And as we go through the uncertainties related to COVID-19, when we come out on the other side, I'm very confident that with our broad portfolio and deep customer engagement and the technology and product capabilities, I think we will overall do just fine. By and large, our mix is fairly similar to the industry in terms of overall mix. If you look at the industry, I think you'll see that tablet is in the 25% to 30% range. The mobile tends to be around 25%. PC is 20%, give or take some. And of course, then is all the others, which we can call like specialty, which includes automotive, includes industrial and other applications. And that, you can -- I think were down around 20%. So I think roughly speaking, I think that's the kind of mix. And you can -- as you can see, it's well diversified across these various end market segments. So I think as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks that we see strong demand and favorable price trends. But we had also seen that in China, as is well known, that during the time frame of our fiscal second quarter aligned with the COVID-19 spread in China starting from around mid-January kind of time frame, it had impacted smartphone demand in China, while it grew the demand in the cloud infrastructure in China. So as now, over the last couple of weeks, you see the spread of coronavirus across the globe and various actions being taken in various countries to contain the spread of coronavirus. We do expect that there will be some impact on the consumer demand, but it is really too soon to quantify that. And again, having said that, we also see increasing demand coming from the cloud side as well as from enterprise PC applications. So we are seeing acceleration of demand on that front. So we are continuing to really manage that, and this is all escalating over the last couple of weeks, and we will, of course, continue to work closely with our customers to understand their increases in demand as well as their demand outlook, for example, in the consumer devices and then manage our business accordingly. The only thing I'd add is, in the prepared remarks, leading up to what I did say that pricing and demand trends were favorable, and that included all the way up until today. But of course, there's a higher degree of uncertainty, and that's kind of why we got to the range we did.","David, in the prepared remarks, you talked about inventory accumulation potentially masking weakness of customers. What -- where specifically might you have that anxiety? It seems like in compute, I think conditions are pretty strong and your customers don't seem to have a lot of this end product inventory. So when you -- is that just a precautionary remark on your side? Or is there anything you're seeing there that creates anxiety? I guess, Sanjay, there was some language in the release that -- and you guys have talked about the fact that you're a lagging indicator relative to demand. Can you just help parse through that? I guess it sounds like maybe you're suggesting that the fiscal fourth quarter could be maybe down sequentially, which is typically up. I know that it's very difficult to tell what's going on right now. But maybe can you just help us walk through what the puts and takes look like into Q4? I know you don't want to guide Q4, but it sounds like it's possibly down. So can you just help us think about that? I'm just kind of curious, Sanjay and Dave, is it possible to quantify what the impact of COVID was in the February quarter? And more importantly, is there a number in mind for May? It's clear the uncertainty is increasing the range for the May guide, but is it also bringing down the midpoint? Any sort of guidance of how you're thinking through that would be very helpful. Great to hear that you're safe and well. I guess my question is regarding the supply side, particularly for DRAM. You talked about some issues related to equipment installation and part availability. You've also talked about switching over some of your capacity from mobility to server. So curious, as you think that through, what does bit production look like now, either for you or for the industry here in calendar '20? I think we were all thinking kind of 6% to 8% coming in. Is that still the right number? Or is there a change there? David or Sanjay, can you please tell me how you think of the mix of revenue from China, especially going back to what Sanjay said earlier, China is resuming operation? They're also providing a lot of incentives for 5G adoption. And I'm just curious how China accounted for your revenues in the February quarter and how you see it trending for the remainder of the year. I had a question on capacity and cost per bit. What percent of your CapEx is flexible? And I appreciate that things are in such a way that it's very hard for you to tell us how much you're going to -- you would flex. But just as a ballpark, what percentage? And then is the cost down going to change based on what you know as of now versus what you told us last quarter for both NAND and for DRAM? Congrats on the great execution. I want to go back to the customer inventory dynamics and trying to understand or appreciate how you think about that potential buildup of inventory. Can you help us understand whether you've implemented anything differently or have different lines of visibility into those customers, how you exactly plan on managing or seeing any kind of inventory build, particularly at some of the cloud customers? A strong memory demand driver in the second half of this year, as you pointed out, is the new game console refresh. I think there's 35% to 100% more GDDR DRAM memory versus prior generations platforms and the move to SSD storage versus HDD. Given your leadership in graphics DRAM, we know that the Micron team will be participating here on these new consoles. But given your good NVMe client SSD positioning, is the team also participating in the console refresh with either your NAND or your SSD products? So impressive guidance there. One of the questions I did have, though, is just the offset of kind of commercial PCs coming back because obviously more people are working from home, offset by kind of the smartphone unit demand. So how are you guys thinking about that for the rest of the calendar year? Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts, but just how do you guys track kind of the lower expected sales probably from the handset type versus commercial PC upgrade from people working from home? Just another question on the demand conditions. I think David had mentioned in his prepared remarks that the macro conditions had weakened in the last couple of weeks, and you talked about some of the moving pieces of that. If we try to quantify that, the impact, DRAM is about 70% of your revenue. NAND is 30%. What percentage of DRAM is coming from PCs, hyperscalers, mobile and likewise, on the NAND side? So we can just kind of get a sense of where the potential strengths and weaknesses could be. I guess just to follow up on some other folks' questions. So you talked about the demand forecast or things changing in the last couple of weeks. Can you just give us a sense of what you've seen in the last couple of weeks? And then also for your -- sort of your forward forecasting, whether it's internal or what you're giving us, are you shaving down what your internal forecast is in anticipation of some more weakness? Or is this kind of like what we see is what we have?
